I have not voted in favour of the relative final resolutions to the reform of the *PAC by the following reasons: 1. It #do not guarantees a *reequlibrio internal among the different components of the *PAC neither a greater equity among agriculturalists, productions and territories; 2. It #do not contributes to the economic and social cohesion of the half rural European: they have not created  mechanisms of weighting of the productivities to end to favour the agricultures of performances lower, *contrariamente to it approved by the European Parliament; 3. It #do not presents any special measure of support to the small agriculturalists, that are the most vulnerable and run the greater risk of abandonment; 4. It #do not reinforces sufficiently the politics of development rural, by it that #do not guarantees the practical application of the #european model of agriculture and of *multifuncionalidad with *él associated; 5. It #do not defends the #european agriculture in front of the negotiations of the new round of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade; 6. It #do not tackles the resolution of the main problems of the #portuguese agriculture: they have not increased  the strategic quotas, like the *regadío or the bovine or the *ovino; it has not achieved  increase the productivity of reference for the cereals and the *oleaginosas; it has not achieved  community finance for the restructuring of the sector *lechero; 8. Finally, because #this has been a reform of the status *quo , without political value, unable to prepare the #european agriculture for the imperative greater that poses the *mundialización and so that it was more favourable to the agriculturalists and the most efficient agricultures.
The Parliament, in fact: -  *opuso to the *condicionamiento of the Bottom of Cohesion to the Pact of Stability, because it believes that the Bottom of Cohesion has to be considered to #all the effects a structural instrument; - it considered that the Bottom of Cohesion had to subject to #the same norms on association that apply  in the structural Bottoms and that his operations scheduled , together with the structural operations, inside a frame integrated in the that they took part the regional and local administrations; the Parliament wished likewise that in the Bottom of Cohesion took into account of #the same mood that in the structural Bottoms the integration of subjects horizontal like the employment and the equality of opportunities; - it asked that the resources of the Bottom of Cohesion in the fields of the transport and the mobility used  to fund projects that improved the regional cohesion and *interregional, the interoperability and the *intermodalidad, and that in the field of the environment used  besides to fund projects allocated to keep and recover the biodiversity and to preserve the natural reservations; - it underlined the importance to be able to group small projects in a greater entity and requested, therefore, that around the 5 % of the total financial endowment put  to disposal of projects of this type.
We #can be proud of the results in four concrete fields: the universal agreement on the absolute priority of the unemployment and the mission of the Social Bottom to support the #european strategy for the employment; second, the confirmation of the thematic structure of the regulation of the bottoms and the scope of the five political fields, that cover from the active politics for the market of work, happening by the social inclusion, the training along #all the life and the adaptability, until the positive action in favour of the women; in *tercer place, have kept and reinforced the commitment to support to the no governmental organisations and to struggle against the social exclusion -share the opinion that the Regulation has to force to the States members to provide small helps, by means of modalities of special access, to the no governmental organisations and the local associations; in chamber place, once again with support of the Parliament, have reinforced the relative disposals to the equality of opportunities and to the principle *mainstreaming of the Regulation.
*Eso Is it that have voted and *me congratulate that, after #a lot of meetings, after #a lot of negotiations, our proposals converge with the point of sight of the Council, mainly in the structural plane, #where accepts  the principle of the right to the growth: the crops *vitivinícolas that have a market in development will be able to obtain supplementary rights; mainly regarding the length of these rights of plantation, that has prolonged  with the end to preserve the necessary rest for the floor; regarding the relative structural measures to the renewal and rejuvenation of the strains -have achieved that it concede  a help-; regarding the cooperatives have contributed  #few modifications, simply an agreement that allows to suppress the relative measures to the extension of his can and reserve, only for his members, the missions that  *les have assigned; regarding the recognition of professions of a common field also, *concediéndoles a juridical statute required in the community right with the end to avert that the States members no producing put it in doubt; in the practices *enológicas also the maintenance of the traditional methods has been recognised; in matter of labeling has approved  a direct disposal of labeling.
It is to say that, although we #can receive with big satisfaction that the European Union have  to create *algo #as well as the conditions for the construction of a #european model of *pólderes in the field of the economic politics and of employment, have to warn, nevertheless, against the risk that #would suppose that this construction do not go accompanied at the same time also of a content, or was, of the modification of the orientation of the economic politics, and specifically of an economic politics oriented to concede sure enough priority to a more durable and reasonable employment, an economic politics that restart the subject of the redistribution of the work, an economic politics that also go back to include sure enough inside his perspectives the necessary tasks in the field of the promotion of the sustainability, of the fulfillment of the commitment of River, of the solidarity in the relations with the #european neighbours and in the context of his stabilisation, in comparison to the economic politics understood like a species of aggregation of the *micropolítica of the great companies, #such as it has occurred during the last twenty years with the negative results already known and predictable that now suffers #all *Europa.
I bill the points very in brief: the reform of the budgetary procedure, with the put to the day of #the same; the extension of the *codecisión budgetary; the integration of the peripheral institutions in the community system; the consolidation of the financial perspectives in form of an authentic financial program to half term; the reform of the system of resources own with the end to ensure the autonomy and the financial efficiency of the Union, by a part, and the transparency of the community budget, by #another, which supposes that there #be *codecisión around the determination of the global level of own resources; the introduction of the possibility to have of fiscal instruments to scale #european; the possibility that the budgetary authority take part #all the years in relation with the mix of the different categories of income; and the extension of the *codecisión legislative and the taking of decisions by qualified majority to the financial regulations in #all the programs or instruments that comport community costs, to the regulations of the *PAC and to #all act that believes an executive agency.
The goals of this proposal are the following: guarantee the existence of the right to the information and the regular query of the workers on the economic and strategic progresses of the company and on the decisions that *les affect in #all the States members of the Union; consolidate the social dialogue and the relation of confidence in the field of the company to end to contribute to the forecast of the risks, the development of the flexibility and of the organisation of the work in the frame of the security, the promotion and the sensitisation of the workers regarding the need of adaptations; include the situation and the promotion of the employment in the company in the subjects of information and query; guarantee that the workers are informed and consulted before they adopt  decisions that #can suppose substantial changes of the organisation of the work and of the contractual relations; guarantee the efficiency of said procedure introducing specific sanctions against #that that break seriously said obligations in these sectors.
Regarding the evolution of the political process, are following actively the strategy to keep the pressure on *Belgrado, a pressure directed to achieve the fulfillment of the five points that the European Union was the first in adopting, among #all the international organisations, that afterwards were assumed by the NATO and that the General Secretary of the UN has adopted like base of his own position, to know: the return of #all the deported, the return of #all the refugees, his return without restrictions to some safe surroundings in *Kosovo, guaranteed by an international strength of peace, stood out in application of a resolution of the Nations Joined based in the foundation of the Chapter *VII, with a central core of strengths of the NATO and a considerable participation of #the same, but in the that also #would take part *Rusia, *Ucrania and neutral countries, accompanied of the simultaneous withdrawal of the strengths of fight and also of the strengths *paramilitares and of the special police of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and of the #serbian State like part of #the same.
How glorious challenges #can *usted confront in name of the Fifteen? Impose like actor to the one hundred by one hundred in Orient Next to contribute to fix a just and durable peace, now possible; *relanzar the negotiations of *Lomé on new bases that integrate the worries of our 71 partners of the south, with the end to save the spirit of this only Convention in the world; take that it hear  a different voice regarding the international financial institutions, for example in favour of the cancellation of the debt of the today blocked countries in his development by this mechanism *infernal; launch a true international crusade in favour of the disarmament, in particular the nuclear, in some moments of enormous danger of proliferation; convert in spokesman, in *portaestandarte of a revaluation of the system of the Nations Joined, of the respect by his Letter, by the promotion of a type of relations international civilised that *destierren for ever the war like half to resolve the differences and in it immediate, by favour, that put end of another form that was not by means of formal communiqués to the inertia *insoportable of the Union in the wild war of *Chechenia.
#5.el Report *Garot, in the that the competition and the tenacity of the speaker have allowed *salvaguardar, in part, the sector of the meat of *vacuno, especially regarding the cows *nodrizas, that conserve the landscape, structure the rural productions, guarantee an income to the productions of quality without hormones and protect the environment.#6.el It inform #Martin, in #whose case my colleagues and *yo same have modified deeply the text of the proposal in a favourable sense to the group of the chain of production of the sector *vitivinícola -#some interested like this *nos have said it-, specifically in it *concerniente to the definition of the wine, to the prohibition to elaborate #european wines with musts mattered of third countries and to the maintenance of the practices *enológicas traditional and, therefore, of the quality that serves of base to our cultural identity #europea.7.el Report *Fantuzzi relative to determined crops *herbáceos, although the treatment that gives  to the products *oleaginosos and *proteaginosos still is distant a lot to be satisfactory.I am persuaded that the agriculturalists and the #european consumers will comprise, as, the sense of my vote, and will be conscious of the fights that still are pending so that the #european construction have a future in this field.
Like this, I go to refer very in brief the decision that finishes  to take takes #few days for the application of the project on the *risk capital, on the investments of capital of high risk, that the past week approved the Commission and that they are an important tool, mainly for the new small companies, the measures to boost the innovation *interfronteriza; the measures to promote the mobility of the employees by means of the transfer of his rights and of his pensions; special programs for his training and, of course, the exceptional quantity of the structural bottoms for the goal 3, to the that belong #all the countries, a quantity of the order of 24.000 millions of euros for the next seven years, that by means of the goal 3 and by means of the programs of the structural bottoms and, of course, by means of the strategy for the employment, #can structure national and political politics connected to #european level that concern to the *empleabilidad, the operating capacity, the adaptability of the companies and of the workers.
#1.el Report *Görlach do not allows, in his current state, with a budgetary endowment too much scarce, apply a true politics of rural development, in spite of being more that never necessary to guarantee a #worthy and sustainable future to the rural zones of the EU (80 % of the territory of the EU).#2.el Report *Mulder remembers in a considering the possibility of the *cofinanciación, that *nosotros have combated because it #would mean, in the long run, the disintegration of the *PAC and of the goals of the #Tratado.3.el Report *Graefe *zu *Baringdorf has not allowed to present a coherent mechanism of *reorientación and of fixation of maximum limits of the agricultural helps according to social and environmental criteria, and the own speaker, after the amendments approved in commission, probably do not recognise a text amended, so different of the #original.4.en what to the Report *Goepel on the milk, #this guaranteed, of course, the maintenance of true *statu *quo , but established the possibility to suppress the quotas #lecheras.en change, have voted in favour of the reports in the that the firm position of the Parliament had taken to retreat significantly the *intransigencia or the *inadecuación of the proposals of the Commission:
Among so much, like the Assembly is to the so much, the main characteristic of the common position reached in the present managerial are the fixation of a minimum tax of the tax by vehicle to the levels of the existent directive and without differentiation in accordance with *Euroclass, the maintenance of determined measures of transition on the taxes of the vehicles, the establishment of types maximum of taxes by the utilisation of the roads with a structure differentiated #such as it proposes it the Council, the disposal of a #enabling power so that the types of tolls #can differentiate according to the class of broadcasts of the vehicle and the hour of the day of utilisation of the road, the disposal allocated to *Austria to apply a toll in relation with the cost of the infrastructure in the tract that goes of *Kufstein to *Brenner and the disposal of a 50 % of reduction of the taxes by the utilisation of the roads for vehicles registered in #Grecia.
An event like *Tampere, that woke up *tantas expectations, #can seem an end in himself/hisself same, but only is the beginning of a process. The Commission believes, nevertheless, that *Tampere transmitted the suitable message to #a lot of audiences: to our citizens, in the first place, that a subject *prioritario for his personal interests also wins importance among the political priorities of the Union; to the national administrations, that there #be not gone back backwards and that his own Bosses of Government have engaged  to introduce improvements, included the institutional improvements of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, and to work as it is had to; to the world of the delinquency, that the Union is *movilizando all his potential to combat his activities that are a threat for our freedom and our welfare, and even for our democratic diets; and finally, to the external world, that an inwardly safe Union do not means a Union fortress and that our commitments with #that that need protection are holy.
Here they find  reports on a resolution of directive of the European Commission that imposes to the States members that adopt the necessary measures so that any society of telecommunications notable in the market #can explode his network of television by wire through #the same juridical person or on the project of a wide project of #french law on the society of the information that, among other things, wants to regulate the questions related with the free employment of keys, the reliability in the traffic of data, of the protection of the rights of author or the necessary instances of regulation; or also, on the last sentences of the European Court of Justice on the Human Rights, with the that they have refused  13 demands against *Turquía, #if well the Court in eleven of the thirteen cases followed to the *demandantes recognising rapes of the right of free expression of opinion.
Now well, of granting in granting, *nos find in the day of today, in name of the logic of the iron of the pact of stability budgetary, in the first place with some estimates and some financial needs for the reconstruction of *Kosovo that have dropped mysteriously of 500 millions of euros -enciphers advanced by the Commission, the World-wide Bank, the States members and the media- to 420, afterwards to some 300 millions; second in front of a reduction of the credits that had voted for *Timor oriental to the equal that for the victims of the earthquake of *Turquía, in *tercer place in front of the cuts in the credits assigned to the cooperation, to the alimentary help, to the help to Palestinian and to the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, to the program *Tacis bear *Europa of the East, to the support to the human rights and finally, confronted to cuts of a total of some 2 *millardos for the credits of payment.
Like chamber point, the global figures also are, obviously, *indicativas of the work made by the commissions and, in particular, by the speakers, and *yo wanted to appreciate, therefore, very sincerely in name of the Commission the report of the Mr. *Virrankoski on the projects of budget for the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Accounts, and the Social Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the report of the Mr. *Pittella on the project of budget operative of the European Community of the Coal and of the Steel, and also very especially the report of the Mr. *Bourlanges. #This shows once again that it is an excellent speaker and a teacher in the presentation of proposals very sophisticated "" .
On the other hand, the purpose manifested by the Commission -and that also is #worthy of *beneplácito- to elaborate annual reports on the relations of the European Union with *Macao #would not have to dispense to the European Parliament to loan, to his time, the greater attention to this subject, very in particular following regularly his evolution from 20 December, tightening to #that *respecto the exchange of informations and cooperation *interinstitucionales, creating his own group of contact, of mutual links, analysing and debating the periodic reports that  *le present, appreciating, finally, the evolution of #all the looks of the *coyuntura related with *Macao with seen to the transformations of the international relations in the Extreme Orient and of the changes that announce  in this zone, without forgetting the new situations that it #can comport the entrance of Chinese in the *OMC and the evolution and/or qualitative modification of his relations with the States Joined of *América.
I have to say, gentleman President, that have achieved a series of goals important in this terrain: by a part, #the same Commission amended  to himself/hisself same, modifying his initial project, modifying even the title of the regulation in the line that requested; and on the other hand, among the two readings have celebrated a series of meetings with the Presidency of the Council that, to my trial, have been positive in the measure in that we have been able to develop the criteria in relation with the application of the program *PHARE, that is basic of face to the organisation and to the institutional reinforcement of these countries, to the inclusion of criteria political in relation with the democracy and with the strengthening of the civil society, in a word, of face to the reinforcement of these societies.

Further of this resolution, will insist in four points: the maintenance of the restrictions with regard to the circulation of vehicles heavy and his harmonisation on the base of the restrictions at present more extended; second, a more forceful action regarding the reduction of the hours of work and of driving of the truck drivers; in *tercer place, the consolidation of a priority of the rail transport of freight in the zones of mountain and in the zones of risk; in chamber place, the need to undertake an action decided with regard to the cooperation of the rail societies to end to harmonise the norms, the materials and the training of the personnel.
. (*SV) In the plan of action common that the EU and #EE.UU. They signed in *Madrid on 3 December 1995, signal  under the title "Reaction in front of global threats" the increase of the collaboration in the fight against the illicit trade with drugs, the measures of cooperation among the competent #american authorities and *Europol, the collaboration to give support to the program of drugs of the UN, the coordination of programs of alternative development to combat the preparation of *estupefacientes and the creation of channels of cooperation among community organs as, for example, the European Centre for the Control of Drugs and *Toxicomanías and the #Inter-American Commission for the control of *drogodependencias.
To finalise, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, #if the European Commission wishes really contribute to the development of the naval sector in *Europa, *le suffices with defending clearly the principle of the just trade during the negotiations of the *OMC, leave to the States members the freedom to take part directly in this strategic sector to reorient technologically #some dockyards to segments of market with future, favour the cooperation among the companies to contribute to improve the global efficiency of each #one of our types of dockyards and, finally, in the frame of the common politics of fishing, adopt the decisions that are necessary to make possible a renewal controlled of our fleet *pesquera, the *perpetuación of the experience of our dockyards and the vitality, gentleman President, of our dependent maritime regions of the fishing.
After the wide internal debate celebrated in April of 1997, affirm in a conference of press the need to reform the system of subsidies, the defence of a global approach, guaranteeing the maximum transparency and a greater control of #all the costs, that, in case that #any of the subsidies of trip had to serve to compensate *algo, #would have to pay  only the trips sure enough facts and by the corresponding value to it that sure enough cost, the consideration of the distance and of the time of transfer by means of a *escalonamiento in the subsidy of stay with a new appropriate instrument; the deputies to the European Parliament do not have to receive *emolumentos equal, but that they have to be in accordance with the situations *salariales of the States members of origin of his representatives chosen.
Improvement of the norms and of the financial organisation; -renewal of the upper levels of the parliamentary administration and introduction of new systems of promotion and of mobility to #all the levels; -increase of the presence of women in the places of direction, although no still in the proportion that to me *me had enjoyed can make; -regulation of the transparency in the administrative decisions, to request of the Defender of the Village; -compilation and *clarificación of the existent norms so that, from now, deputies and civil servants know *cuales are his rights and obligations, according to clear rules that avert the *arbitrismo or the favour to the friend.Also it has achieved  resolve of satisfactory way the technical problems and of relative finance to our buildings of *Bruselas, culminating like this the obstinacy of my predecessors for endowing to the deputies of facilities more functional and concentrated.
Gentleman President, take note and comprise the point of sight of the committee in his final considerations about that there #be not an only measure that #can treat the problem of the mentality, but believe that a wide and clear strategy of reform, some effective mechanisms to reckon and insist *vigorosamente in the achievement of goals, the quality of the public service and the assessment of the money, the vocational training in the technicians and the ethical of the management, a promotion strictly *meritocrática, some just disciplinary procedures firm and reliable, the continuous emphasis in the professionalism and the #probity in the school and in the services #can *moldear the mentality.
This Parliament has taken a very clear position, since it has predicted that, before the enlargement, have to make  *obligatoriamente #some great institutional reforms #if we want to avert that *Europa convert  only and exclusively in a big zone of *librecambio, prey of an extraordinary capacity of indecision by a regulation and by some obsolete internal rules. It has indicated likewise that they do not suffice the decisions on the vote by majority and the composition of the Commission to give a new impulse and a new strength to *Europa, but that it is necessary to take other paths as, for example, the of the Letter of Rights Fundamental and of #some of the things that had to join #all the big #european movement, logically, inside the respect of the nations, of his feelings, of his history, of his tradition that consider very important.
How new answers contributes *usted to this thirst of resistance that, in front of the career *desenfrenada by the profitability is manifesting  in #all *Europa, for example, in this same moment, in my country, to *través of the enormous movement of charm to the workers of the group *Michelin that finishes to announce 7.500 suppressions of employment in *Europa, after having increased his benefits in a 20 %?How new answers contribute *ustedes to those and to #that that expect that *Europa promote a real dynamics of alternatives to the globalisation of exclusion today in practice, already treat  of employees, of peasants, of literate persons that argue the rules of the world-wide trade, or of two #guinean youngsters victims of the exodus of the misfortune, without an international order that recognise to each human being the right to the life, to the work and to the dignity?
Therefore, I believe that -understanding totally even the narrow current mandate for the Conference in it that concerns to the review of the institutions as a result of the Treaty of *Amsterdam- it is necessary to tackle the necessary reform and in depth of our Court of Justice and of our Court of First Instance, the reform of the nomination of the judges -in the that this Parliament has to have an important participation-, the reform of the cast of competitions among the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, so that the citizen #can have an idea *cabal and clear of #which is this #european justice that also is his direct justice, and the reform, in end -and #that already is of another chapter- of the *justiciabilidad of the acts.
How another thing #can mean the proposals that listen , and that in general are collected in the report, on the changes in the votes of the Council, on the change of the number, or of the competitions, of the commissioners, on the decrease of the popular representation in the *PE after the increase of the number of states of the EU, but the *reforzamiento of the position of the rich countries of the EU, the *reforzamiento of the position of the companies *monopolistas, that in his majority have his headquarters in these countries, the attempt to minimise any resistance of the villages, or even of the countries, to the *antipopulares resolutions of the EU that affect or #can affect even to national interests?
That it reestablish  the peace to allow political negotiations and the immediate end of the military aggression to a sovereign State are not horizons of this majority that before prefers to justify the intervention of the NATO, the *servilismo of the EU and of his States in front of the strategic interests Americans, the *inobservancia of the order and the international rights and of the Letter of the Nations Joined, before prefers to defend the climbing of the war and the approval of orientations political that they have to put by strength in risk solve negotiated and the resolution of the relative fundamental questions to the regional autonomies and his ethnic minorities.
Of course this effort of revaluation of the Union in his group concerns also to the responsibilities of the European Parliament and of the Council -and #this also go it to argue with the new Commission- #as well as to *usted, a political guide that convert to the Commission in a strong speaker with regard to the great open questions and of the that depends the evolution and the identity of the Union, some political questions that *revisten a big institutional importance, as *recalcaba, for example, the Mr. President *Martens to the hour to tackle the subject of the relation among the Institutions regarding the institutional reforms, key subject of the next years.
To #that *respecto, have to stand out the principle of the mutual recognition of the decisions and sentences, to the that has to contribute the adoption of definitions and common sanctions in #all the States members against some criminal activities of character *transfronterizo, as, for example, in the spheres of the delinquency organised, of the illicit traffic of drugs, of the traffic of human beings or of the delinquency against the boys; I have to stand out equally the creation of the network *EUROJUST, that is without place to doubts the beginning of the construction of a judicial component of the European Union that it was instrument of support and of control of the action of *EUROPOL with seen to guarantee the inner security and also an instrument of defence of the rights of the #european citizens.
It considers the Council that statements like the effected by the #danish Minister of External Subjects, Mr. *Petersen, the one who affirmed that the decision quoted transmits the correct message that the democracy and the wish of reforms obtain his *recompensa, express the point of sight of the EU and of the designated international community on the respect of the freedoms and the fundamental democratic values, and that the decision of character #blackmailer of *Luxemburgo is a "message" that promotes the democracy, pushing to a village and his political representatives, by means of the *coacción, to follow practices *antidemocráticas with the end to survive, in place to guarantee the normal democratic operation of the institutions in the next elections?
It takes fault a complete review of the politics of the European Union that include and confront: the democratisation of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade; the support to the familiar model of agriculture; the necessary mechanisms for the *dignificación of the workers of the *Tercer World, so that it do not prejudice  his productive and commercial statute; the protection of the environment; the diffusion of the technology in the poorest countries; the treatment of the international debt of the feeblest countries; the protection of the cultural diversity of the planet in front of the *superpotencia North American of the show.
While this morning a colleague put of self-evident the fact that the three institutions of the European Union managers to sign the budget were chaired by women and saw in this fact #one *figuración of it that it #can represent the *tercer #millenium for the consolidation of the equality of rights and of opportunities man-woman, in *Afganistán see how the #taliban diet no only denies to the woman -to millions of women- the exercise of his more elementary rights -like the rights to the education, to the health or to exert a profession-, no only this diet exerts violence on *ella by the mere fact to be woman but that, with the negation of these rights, *le is also denying the freedom to live his own life, *le is denying his condition of person.

The conflict, amply fed these two weeks, among the Parliament and the Council, do not has to *hacernos forget #some essential questions: regarding the help conceded to the region of *Kosovo, #can *sorprendernos the fact that this help was not conditioned by the definite return to the peace, it that, alas, do not occurs, as it remembers it a recent report of the *OSCE; regarding the amounts assigned, the members of the Commission of Budgets have assisted in the distinct commissions to a true dribble, since the institutions took *malabarismos with the millions of euros, without that nobody have taken  really the work to reckon the needs of the region, since #all said that *Kosovo #can not at present absorb #such amounts, equivalents to the half of his *PNB.

1.Complaint and conviction of the most conclusive form the catastrophic bombardment to the studies of the television in *Belgrado (22 April 1999).2.It expresses, *consternado, his weigh in front of the grave losses in human lives (ten dead persons and *decenas of injured) among workers of the information.3.It considers that it treats  of a barbaric hit against the fundamental human rights, against the right to the freedom of word and of expression, to the freedom of press.4.It believes that it is inadmissible, in this case, any reference to bellicose «or» humanitarian «needs»!!!5.It asks to his President that transmit the present resolution to the Council, to the governments of the States members, to the Government of *Yugoslavia, to the International Union of Journalists and to the NATO.- Common resolution - European Council of Colony
So that with the #finnish Presidency will progress the militarisation subordinated to the NATO of the European Union, under the Presidency precisely of a country that do not belongs to the NATO and that it was known up to now by his pacifist orientation; it will renew  the participation of the European Union, in the breast of the new NATO, in similar crimes, or even worse, to the imperialist aggression to *Yugoslavia; it will intensify  the frontal aggression to the workers, will increase the unemployment and the *marginalización, will sharpen  the social and territorial disequilibriums; it will keep , *veinticinco years afterwards, the occupation of the 40 % of *Chipre by the #turkish diet with the support of the European Union, #as well as the genocide of the village *kurdo, #whose fight is described of terrorist.
In front of *nosotros are the economic and social challenges arisen as a result of the introduction of the only coin, the realisation of a deep reform of the Institutions and the attribution of a concrete sense to the rights of the citizens; from the point of sight external, a strategic gap of at least ten years that it is necessary to satisfy regarding the dramatic crisis of the *Balcanes, the resumption of a #mediterranean politics backed by the process of peace that has restarted his career, the dramatic crisis of *Rusia, the defence of the human rights and of the minorities of the world.
Gentleman President, since the controversial decision of the #turkish government that debate constitutes a case more of fault of respect and of rape of the right of the sea by part of *Turquía after the known decision of the Big National Assembly Turkish to empower to the #turkish government to consider «*casus *belli» and declare the war to #Grecia in the case that #Grecia exerted his legitimate right to expand the #greek territorial waters in accordance with the convention of the UN that only *Turquía has denied  to sign, ask to the Council #if it proposes  signal also this subject in his request to *Ankara and in the conversations that, during the imminent European Council of *Helsinki, will keep , on the relations of the European Union with *Turquía and on the criteria that #this, as *nos has said the Mr. Minister, will have to fulfil.
Although the proposal of regulation of the Commission began to negotiate  before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, in the Commission of Subjects Juridical -that approves in general the proposal of regulation, since it goes directed to delay the disarmament of the *arbitrios #canarian and, therefore, has a protective function- think that after the entrance in vigour of the article 299.2 it that proceeds is not a simple *suavización of the limitation of the special treatment but paralyse the elimination of this special treatment because, predictably, in the measures that have to propose the Commission for the regions *ultraperiféricas of compliance with said article 299.2, that foresees special measures in matter of fiscal politics, the Commission will allow predictably a small rearm so as to that the small local industries affected do not result prejudiced.
Along these months, of these last years, consider the article 6 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam the reaffirmation of the weight and of the paper that in the European Union have the principles of freedom, of democracy, of respect of the human rights or, even, the constitution of the International Penal Court or the need that #all warn to give greater strength to the article 7 of the Letter of the Organisation of the Nations Joined with the object to be able to guarantee the respect of the human rights preventing the exercise of the eventual humanitarian interferences to logics that are not linked pure and simply to the respect of said rights: all #this *nos shows that they have made  great progresses.
The first is the greater attention loaned to the access, to the market of work after the process of training; the second is the field of the technology of the information, in the that it takes  a big effort -to the that is not extraneous the imminent initiative of the Commission on the society of the information- for linking the problem of the employment to the computing; the third is the active paper of the local instances -in relation with the *cual urges  and encourages  to the States members to that they recognise a greater specific weight to the municipal authorities-, and, of course, the paper of the social agents.

The most significant innovations that we want to introduce are the following: the attentive consideration of the consequences of the *morosidad in the payments of the perishable alimentary products; the recognition of the right to demand the *resarcimiento of the derivative costs of the collection of the credit; the clause of reservation of command in favour of the seller; the certainty that an executive title #can be taken effective in the term of 60 days from the date in that the creditor formulate the demand; finally, the greater transparency in the relation among the administration *adjudicadora and the contractor, #as well as in the relation of outsourcing.

Have to remember in brief that in the group presented by the Commission the past year appeared in the first place an amendment to the whole of the directive of 1993, on the that *versa the report of the Mrs. *Smet, a directive on the transport by road that, lamentably, is totally blocked in the Council of Transports in this moment, as have understood; the third, a directive of application of the agreement among the social speakers on the persons of sea, was approved in form of directive in June of this year, by it that this element already is dismissed, and, finally, the proposal of the that go to talk today, a directive on the application of the labour day on board of fuselages that take scale in the ports of the Community.
More specifically, regarding the #french legislation -to the that the Mr. *Rothley has taken reference- #such as it was drafted in the moment of the sentence of 10 January 1995 dictated in the procedure *nº 229/93 *Leclerc "*Au *blé *vert" , the Court of Justice declared that, in the field of a national legislation that establishes a diet of price fixed of the book, are measured of equivalent effect to the restrictions to the import, forbidden by the article 28 (ancient article 30) of the Treaty, the norms "that, with regard to the sale of books published in #the same Been member affected and *reimportados, previous export to another Been member, force to observe the price of sale imposed by the editor, unless they do not exist founded reasons to consider that said books were exported with the only purpose of his *reimportación allocated to evade said law" .

In effect, is necessary the abolition of the internal borders protecting the security of the citizens, the harmonisation regarding the admission and circulation of citizens of third countries inside the European Union, creating a politics of immigration and of asylum more uniform and *solidaria, the coordination of the actions of prevention and the fight against the delinquency and, in particular, the delinquency organised (especially, the terrorism, the traffic of human beings, the offences against the boys, the traffic of drug and arms, the corruption and the fraud) and, finally, the guarantee in the #european level of the rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Commission recommends with #a lot of taste the amendments of commitment presented by the speaker, Mrs. *Jöns, relative to: add to the article 1 the social integration in the market of work, to know, the amendment 1; the new formulation of the *tercer system of social economy in the article 2, to know, the amendment 8; the importance that so much the Commission like the Parliament consider that it has to attribute to the principles of equality of opportunities and of adaptability, to know the amendment 9; and the best conditions that proposes the Parliament for the granting of small helps with disposals of special access for the no governmental organisations, to know the amendment 10.
*B4-0460/99 of the deputies *Colajanni and *Swoboda, in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists-*B4-0479/99 of the deputy *Bertens, in name of the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers-*B4-0486/99 of the deputy *Pasty, in name of the Group Union by *Europa-*B4-0488/99 of the deputies *Wurtz and #others, in name of the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left-*B4-0495/99 of the deputies *von *Habsburg and #others, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European-*B4-0503/99 of the deputies *Gahrton and #others, in name of the Group of the Greens in the Parliament *Europeosobre the process of peace in the Orient Next and the term of 4 May 1999.
Without embargo, *yo have the *convencimiento that an event occurred in *Europa finished for giving the last impulse to the Government of Of *Klerk, constituted to finals of 1989, and *le allowed to gather the necessary value to open the doors to a radical change of the system and with *ello to his own disappearance. The fall of the wall of *Berlín, as last visible symbol of the end of a system, in #whose name had not defended  precisely the freedom and the democracy in the *África *Austral, finished with the subjective perception of the *surafricanos white that #if they celebrated  some democratic elections of compliance with the principle "*one *man, *one vote, eleven to vote " (a man, a vote, an only vote) #would finish living another time in a system *monopartidista, and also in an economy *estatalizada, fruit of the expropriation.
For example, the enlargement of the Council "General Subjects" to the ministers of defence, formula already experienced the past Monday; the set up of a permanent political organ, the "*COPS" , commissioned to follow #all the relative questions to the external politics and of common security, included the relative to the defence; the set up of a military committee; the creation of a strength of intervention fast of some 50.000 men, etc., etc.; and I do not forget that the #finnish Presidency has conceded #a lot of importance to the improvement of the no military means of security, mainly to preventive title.
I have wanted that each boss or *subjefe of cabinet was a citizen of a distinct State of the State of the Commissioner and that in each cabinet there are persons of three States different members like minimum; the rules to appoint to the high civil servants will be more strict and transparent and inside the Commission will increase  the mobility of the high civil servants; the General Directions of the Commission will identify  with brief and clear denominations, instead of with numbers; it will create  a stronger service in the sector of the means and of the communication to guarantee that the politics of the Commission take  public with professionalism, so as to get to #all the #european citizens.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0033/1999) of the Mr. *Harbour in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market on the common position of the Council ((8697/1/1999 - *C5-0031/1999 - 1998/0071 (*COD)) relative to the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive of the Council 70/221/*CEE of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the deposits of fuel liquid and the devices of protection rear of the vehicles to engine and of his trailers.
Second, it is equally desirable and urgent the voluntary participation of the workers in the capital of his company, so much as it indicates it the speaker in his amendment 12 to the guidelines for the employment, and *ello by two reasons. In the first place, by reasons funded relative to the need to improve the endowment of capital own of the companies to resist to the *imposiciones of the great bottoms of investment and protect the employment, but also by a human reason that resides in the evolution of the places of work with future, the *cuales that demand a level of training increasingly high and a personal commitment that only #can  take advantage of and boost intelligently by means of the participation.
In the first place it appears the concept of health public that have interpreted of wide form of compliance with the definition of the World-wide Organisation of the Health -the health is a state of welfare physical, mental and social total- in line, therefore, also with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, #as well as the same concept of violence that covers the looks quoted: the violence no only is a rape of the psychic and physical integrity of the that the suffer, but that constitutes a grave social damage that prejudices, cost the redundancy, to #all, is to say, to the victim, the aggressors and the citizens.
Of way more general, do not believes the Commission -seen the situations of #crisis and the increasing threat that represent the numerous diets *antidemocráticos present in this region of the world- that the development of a strategic relation, political, economic and cultural among the EU and the Indian -the most populated democracy of the world- #would allow to join, of significant and exemplary way, in an alone political, the will to establish political and economic relations privileged with the countries governed by the principles and the rules of the democracy and of the State of Right, #as well as economic and commercial interests very understood?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, results *reconfortante that in a so important negotiation like the of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade the fifteen States members have adopted a common position to establish, in the field of the agriculture, some rules of game stable that allow a loyal competition in the world-wide stage and confront with clarity the challenges of the new #millenium, since they have taken  like central base the positions adopted in his day in the diary of the agreement of agriculture of the Round *Uruguay and in the Diary 2000 of *Berlín, #as well as the maintenance *multifuncional of the agriculture.
In relation with the libraries and the promotion of the democracy and the culture, the Council leaves proof that in the article 151 of the Treaty of the Union indicates  that the community efforts to boost the cultural development in the States members, respecting his national and regional diversity, have to orient to boost the collaboration among the States members and, #if it is necessary, support and complete his activities -in the first place- to improve and spread knowledges on the history and the culture of the #european villages -second- to conserve and protect the *acervo cultural that have meant for *Europa -in *tercer place- for cultural exchange no commercial and -in chamber place- for the artistic and literary creation, included the audiovisual sector.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the recommendation (To5-0023/1999) for the *segunda reading, in name of the Commission of Culture, Education, Media and Sport, on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (8076/1/1999 - *C5-0024/1999 - 1996/0130(*COD)), by the that modifies  the Directive of base relative to the program #Socrates with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios, and on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (8077/1/1999 - *C5-0025/1999 - 1996/0131(*COD)), by the that modifies  the Decision of base relative to the program The Youth with *Europa *III with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios (Speaker: Mr. *Gargani).
And it is it because, although *Turquía is a country that has shown #any difficulty in this terrain - *le confess, gentleman President, that in the commission has listened  the echo of this problematic, of this difficulty to the hour to accept this idea in the #european field, in the *Europa so opened to the culture, as they have reiterated along #all the afternoon the distinct orators in his speeches on the four measures that, in some mood, are interrelated - believe that this decision will carry to describe to *Europa in his whole like a group of States that watches to the new countries of open way and with big dignity and offers great possibilities of development from the point of sight of the freedom and of the culture.
In fact, in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission in the that it examined  #all this sector of the auxiliary doctors and in period of training put of relief seven looks that require the adoption of measures immediate: the excessive labour day in #some countries; the question of the policemen; fixation of turns little realistic; prolonged periods of permanent service; the distribution of the services among the auxiliary doctors and the upper doctors; the no official pressures that suffer the doctors in period of training; the vulnerability of the periods of rest in front of the pressure of the necessary service.
Lady deputy, although the Council -say it very on purpose to the principle- concedes really a big importance to the measures for the promotion of the equality of opportunities among men and women and to the concrete application of the corresponding disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, it that it is applicable to #all the organisations, institutions and corporations that know in *Europa, from the European Parliament until the Commission and also to #the same Council, lamentably, have to *indicarle that roots exclusively in the field of responsibilities of the the States members propose to the members of the European Commission of compliance with the disposals of the Treaties and that the distribution of tasks inside the Commission is, by it other, an internal subject of the Commission.
We have to react it before possible, especially by what know the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone: the *hidroclorofluorocarburos (*HCFC), used mainly in the facilities of refrigerated and of air conditioned, as dissolvent and for the production of plastics *esponjados of isolation; the bromide of methyl, allocated mainly to the fumigation of the earths of crop to combat the harmful animals and the illnesses of the plants, classified by the WHO in the category of substances "highly poisonous" ; the chlorofluorocarbons (*CFC), used in the systems of refrigeration and used before in the manufacture of plastics *esponjados, of dissolvent and like gases *propelentes for aerosols; the *halones use  to combat fires, in particular in areas #where the extinction of fires is subjected to hard controls of quality (specifically in the planes), and in products of replacement no dangerous.
Subject: Content of the informal Council of Ministers of External Subjects of the EU According to #news published in the press, immediately after the kidnapping of *Ocalan by secret services and in circumstances of reservation without precedents, celebrated  near of the #german capital an informal extraordinary meeting of the Ministers of Subjects External of the EU, with the participation of his homologous Swiss, that had by object coordinate the action directed to dismantle the logistical infrastructure of the PKK, establish codes of cooperation and mutual information among the secret services and «face up» to the network of communications of the *kurdos in *Europa, #whose main elements are the channel of television *MED-TV and the diary *Özgür *Politika.

Had account that the Report #Adam on the nuclear security approved in the past month of March by our Plenary, asked, among other things, that limited  the employment of reactors *RBMK, #as well as of the reactors of construction #soviet *VVER that now the #czech authorities have foreseen to use in *Temelin, subscribe the conclusions presented by the spokesman of our delegation of Alliance national and speaker for opinion, that have served like corollary to the Report #Adam; to know: first, the security is the fundamental element of the strategy of *preadhesión; second, has to reinforce  the international rule in matter of systems of security; third, the control on the application of said normative has to entrust to an independent organism.
The States members agree in that it is necessary to avert the contradictions among the project of Convention and among the guidelines of performance elaborated by the Union, as they are, for example, the measures of action common adopted on 3 December 1998 regarding the bleaching of money, the recognition of the instruments and benefits of the offences, the methods of persecution, the freezing of bottoms and the sentences of embargo and expropriation, and also the measures adopted on 21 December 1998 on the *involucración of the authorities in the criminal activities.
More intense has to be #ours worry in front of the attempts to avert and to substitute the convention of Gin, that is the basic source of International Right by the that govern  the refugees, with the approval of a "diet of protection provisional", and also in front of the considerations on the modification of the Agreement of *Dublín on the asylum, on the hardening of the relative legislation to the procedure of processing of the requests of asylum, and on the most effective application "" of the procedures to move away to the persons #whose requests of residence are refused
#This is the reason by the *cual the Commission of Freedoms Public proposed that, from now, in the field of the politics of asylum and of immigration there are two budgetary instruments: the first, a #european bottom for the refugees allocated to fund of a structural way the necessary measures for the received, the integration and the voluntary repatriation of the refugees in case of a normal flow; and the second, #one *segunda budgetary line to allow the adoption of measures of emergency in the case of influx massive of refugees.
Gentleman President, the commitment of the European Union, confirmed in the Report *Schwaiger, in favour of the creation of a permanent forum of work among the International Organisation of the Work and the World-wide Organisation of the Trade to treat of the subjects related with the trade, the globalisation and the work is the only road to accompany the liberalisation of the trade and the exchanges in general to the respect to the fundamental rights of the work, without dropping in the selfish protectionism and *hipócrita or in the disloyal competition and *autodestructiva.
It is necessary that the Parliament say, before that the Council decide the creation of an organ commissioned to draft the project of Letter, that #can not accept a number of representatives of the inferior European Parliament to the of the representatives of the bosses of Government of the States members and that ask an attentive query before deciding #if the essential contribution of the national parliaments has to guarantee   through the participation of a true number of his representatives in the planned organ or through other more effective channels.
On 25 September the military administration gave beginning to the expropriation of earths #palestinian pertaining to 79 villages in the zone of the Green Line, some earths cultivated and inhabited, to the equal that in the adjacent village to *Hebrón; in *Jerusalén This to the women and the men  *les withdraw the documents of identity to reduce his presence, through an operation that the Centre of Rights Human #israeli has designated silent deportation; it remains without resolving the drama of the #palestinian refugees.
Has foreseen the Council keep his decision on the review and request to the Commission that guarantee that the airports in the zones of Goal *nº 1 and zones of Goal *nº 1 in transition do not see  prejudiced by the loss of income like result of the suspension of the free sales of taxes, it that inevitably will conduct to a rise of the prices for the consumers, the loss of benefits for the aerial lines, the companies of transport maritime, ports and airports, and that encloses a threat for the employment in the sectors and the small companies that supplied products to the free shops of taxes?
We think, without embargo, that in the following questions #can not coincide with the Parliament: the fusion of the humanitarian help and of the assistance to the reconstruction in an only organism, the separation of the income of the Agency of the credits assigned to the programs, the exclusion of the contributions of other sources of the budget of the Agency, the approval of the endowment of personnel by part of the budgetary Authority and a report on the possible settlement of the Agency to the cape of 24 months.
When transmitting of the most forceful mood the demand of the pacifist movement all over the world, demand immediate concrete initiatives directed to the destruction of the nuclear arms and of #all the arms of destruction massive, the definite general prohibition of the nuclear proofs, the prohibition to install nuclear arms further of the borders of the countries that the possess, in accordance with the Treaty of No Nuclear Proliferation, the withdrawal of the nuclear arms installed or stored in other countries and the prohibition to export nuclear waste.
Also therefore has the greater sense and *reviste the greater political opportunity the adoption of a clear position, able to express the aspirations founded and the commitment of the villages of the Union concerning the future of the special administrative region of *Macao in the political frame of Chinese and of the relations of *Europa with both in matter of defence and promotion of the human rights, of the other values of the State of right and of the specific juridical frame applied to the region in virtue of his new statute and of the principle "a country, two systems" .
Since the respect of the human rights constitutes an essential element of the cooperation and of the development among the European Union and the Republic of *Djibouti, ask, inside the respect of these principles, the release of #all the political prisoners, the access to the medical assistance of #all the arrested persons -and especially the urgent provision of medical assistance to the Mr. #Mohamed *Kadamiousouf, loomed of blindness-, that guarantee  the freedom of expression and the political pluralism, indispensable for #all democracy, #as well as the cessation of the repression against the opposition.

*Me Cheer #a lot of that the report have not centred  only in the reform of the treaties and of the procedures, that have not limited  to the general looks, but that, at the end, have opted for establishing and consecrate a series of priorities. Among *ellas appears the need to reach advances that *redunden in benefit of the security of *Europa and of the citizens in the frame of the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice, #as well as the consecration of the susceptible procedures to convert said space in reality.

Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0043/1999) of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, concerning the common position adopted by the relative Council to the proposal of Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 88/77/*CEE (5734/1/1999 - *C5 - 0028/1999 - 1997/0350(*COD)) of the Council, relative to the approximation of the States members on the measures that have to adopt against the broadcast of gases and particles *contaminantes pertinent of engines *diesel allocated to the propulsion of vehicles (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer) (Speaker: Mr. *Lange).
#One *Europa directed by a directory #would be the negation of a stimulating process of #european integration that have lived -with imperfections, true is, but with the participation of #all the countries-, by it that the cooperation reinforced, in our opinion, has to be an exception and no a rule of the work inside the European Union, because many times there #be political will to cooperate, but there are not conditions, from the point of sight economic or from another point of sight, to take reality this will of cooperation reinforced.
The result of the unofficial meeting of the Ministers of Subjects External, celebrated in *Saariselkä, and that it was published in the conclusions of the Council of Subjects General of 13 September, #as well as the participation of the Minister of Subjects External, Mr. *Cemin, in the breakfast of the Council of Subjects General are signals that, in opinion of the #finnish Presidency, mean a new constructive beginning in the relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Therefore, with the hand in the chest, *cuando read the newspapers, ascertain that even in the breast of the European Union our goals, *ora the goals of politics of environment, *ora the goals of politics social, *ora the essential labour norms, were presented of protectionist way; #if among *nosotros, in the European Union, have not been able to share our goals, so much less in the breast of the group of states of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
Gentleman President, although it is positive that the European Union want to expand to other countries to consolidate in *ellos the development of the democracy and to strengthen his economic capacity of face to confront the world-wide market -in the *cual, reiterate it by *enésima time, have to defend the national productive peculiarities struggling against the homologation and the *nivelación, indisputable causes of the loss of the specific cultures and of the quality of the products- is equally necessary that the Parliament reiterate firmly that the entry of a new country has to be subordinated to the effective application in #the same of the criteria that already fixed  in *Amsterdam.
As well, in front of this certainly complex situation, #one *constatación: there #be not transitory right, there are not transitory disposals in the Treaty of *Amsterdam and, therefore, have to take an interpretation *integrador and constructive from the principles that *subyacen to the Treaty; an interpretation that, for the Parliament, bases  in three points: answer to our responsibility bear with the citizens preserving the competitions that the Treaty *le awards to the Parliament and by #whose observance have to watch, #as well as *cuando  the attribute to other institutions, as they #can be the new queries to the Committee of the Regions or to the Economic and Social Committee.
#All these cases, these commercial clashes, that have in this moment with the States Joined or also with *Canadá constitute in principle cases test in the that it tests  in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade the limit of until where gets the grade of the independence and of the autonomy of the states in the field of the self-determination of determined political, was the protection of the consumers, was the sanitary assistance, was the question of how #can take  politics in the frame of the countries in roads of development, as in the case of the bananas, or was in the case of the standards.
In the economic and social plane, the axes of action tackle the restructuring of the companies, the public finances, the banking system or the accesses to the international financial markets, the norms and the certification, the politics of competition, the access to the market, the technological cooperation and the development of the agricultural reform and the social dialogue.
#If, after his statement in the European Parliament, #can not  put in doubt the will of the Roman Mr. *Prodi of *sanear and improve the operation of the Commission, neither #can  put in doubt his will to continue the construction of #one *Europa liberal in the that the workers do not take  in consideration: neither a word on the social dialogue, neither a word on the public service, neither a word on the need to constitute this base of the fundamental social rights without the *cuales will have *deslocalizaciones by «*dumping» public prosecutor.

Our proposal of resolution will contain especially the dynamic elements that have been treated already by the President of the Council and also by the Commissioner *Lamy and that contain our ideas for a better inclusion of the financial provision, for a politics of investments and of competition in the frame of the *OMC, for a back reduction of the tariffs on the industrial products and for a better inclusion, even *Mainstreaming, of the protection of the environment and of the consumer in the regulatory drama of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
*Yo Expect, therefore, that, after this first communication of the Commission, the present Commission in front of the Parliament a strategic program, with a necessary legislative package, with more time by part of the Commission and by part of the Parliament, but expect also that, along this term of office, the inner market convert  in a reality and that, when converting  in a reality, take  in benefit of the citizens, take  in benefit of the workers and that allow to follow consolidating this social model European that *yo #would say that, in this moment, constitutes the envy of the countries that do not belong to the European Union.
Gentleman *Lamy, *yo *le urge, therefore, to that *usted and the Commission take also #his these points that finish to enumerate, to the equal that #others wider, and concretise and guarantee the inclusion of these fundamental looks already in the inaugural round of negotiations, so that in the next years #can follow working in the frame of the Round of the #Millenium so that the World-wide Organisation of Trade was it that wish that it was, an organisation of the just and respectful trade with the environment that *nos allow to develop the commercial exchanges, but allowing at the same time the existence of our persons and of our environment.
Personally I have been able to check that to an applicant of asylum #nigerian  *le was conceding asylum on the base of a false passport of #Liberia, that a #albanian family took  happen by natural of *Kosovo, that another Nigerian had borrowed his #british passport to his cousin and taking happen by *él had been able to go in in the Realm Joined, #where committed an offence, and that a #algerian was living with the identity of a #french citizen and had bought his document of identity in the #black market of #París.
Therefore, in name of the Spaniards that in this moment are enormously concerned by the subject, expect that the Commission transmit to the Council our worry, our disagreement with the last resolutions of the Council of Ministers of Industry -that seems #willing, in a sweet *laissez *faire, to abandon it little that *nos remains of naval sector European- and the hope that or well take  measured to avert this disloyal competition that is producing  or, of not to take like this, proceed  to a rearm of the community helps to compensate the inequalities, incompetences and bad forms that are producing  today in #all the centres of the naval construction.
*Permítame Take advantage of this opportunity to signal that the speaker of the Commission of Control Budgetary, the Mrs. *Theato, and *yo have taken part together in front of a committee for the taking of contact of #all the presidents of the Courts of Accounts national of the States members and of the Court of Accounts to communicate to these key persons that the fight against the fraud to the community bottoms is also a national task.
In the level of the European Council, it that decided  was that the Bosses of State or of Government #would occupy  again of the matters related with the justice and the subjects of interior in the European Council of June of the year 2000, the Council of Saint #Maria gives *Feira, to appreciate more in detail the called external dimension of the justice and the subjects of interior, is to say, the implications in the sphere of the external politics of the European Union of the new priorities approved by *Tampere for the sector of freedom, security and justice.
Gentleman President, this report shows that, #if there was political will, #would be possible, with the current Treaty, reform the operation of the Commission in the sense to take of *ella a true organ of political impulse for the #european construction and an independent organ of the Governments and of the private interests and reform the operation of the European Parliament to end to take of *él, like organ chosen directly by the citizens, the centre of the political life in the European Union.

The Commission considers in any case like a special merit of the European Parliament that the necessary discipline of costs do not take  to charge of the poorest of the Community. This discipline of costs *nos allows to #the same time establish an important package of enlargement and in the sectors of politics internal and in the administrative tasks have reached *márgenes of additional performance bear, on the one hand, accompany of mood directed the economic impulse and of employment that initiates  and, by #another, put to the administration in situation to take  charge of the new additional tasks.
In front of the criteria to go conforming an agricultural politics that take more in account the structural nature of #some realities through a politics of development rural able to correct #some of the situations of our rural world, as it is the need to diversify his activities, to offer to his new citizens opportunities and to avert the continuous losses of population, opts  by a politics of development rural minimum and without authentic fortress.
Second, avert that the Commission and the Committees that the assist adopt an act of character legislative without following the procedure of *codecisión normal; third, guarantee to the European Parliament the faculty to take part quickly to the effect of *oponerse to the legitimacy and to the content of a norm of execution, a point that wakes up some satisfaction in the negotiation, and chamber, achieve a real simplification and no limited to the elimination of the variants of the Committees with arrangement to the decision of 1987.
To the *respecto, *nos has satisfied to attract in his words the will to loan greater attention no only to it that to the work refers , but also to the right to the health, a greater attention, for example, to the quality of the alimentary products, because the damage that cause cases like the chicken contaminated by dioxin or the crazy cows, to the global credibility of the community Institutions, is an enormous damage that no  *palia with words and that, lamentably, in #a lot of cases gives place to the need to have of long, a time that no always explain the Institutions.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0033/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position (8697/1999 - *C5-0031/1999 - 1998/0071 (*COD)) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 70/221/*CEE of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the deposits of fuel liquid and the devices of protection rear of the vehicles to engine and of his trailers
Like only instrument of finance and programming for the cooperation, CULTURE 2000 bills a group of goals directed to attend, more and better, these needs, with it that it #can represent a decisive step with seen to a cultural politics #worthy European of this name, is to say, an instrument that allow the contact reiterated, interactive and child-bearing among the cultures of the diverse countries members so that the variety of the sectors considered and the *multidisciplinaridad of the realisations are increasingly an element *vivificante of the own *humus of the #european identity without damage of the pluralism and of the essential diversity of these cultures.
*GOODYEAR, *RENAULT, now *MICHELIN -adapting to the models of development promoted with the creation of the only inner market, and stressed with the Treaties of *Maastricht and *Amsterdam and with the Economic and Monetary Union-, have cost  of the conditions of immunity that have gone  creating, with the progressive disappearance of #all notion of responsibility social and of protection of the workers, and that have deprived of his employment to an every time greater number of persons, *empujándolas to the space of the unemployment and of the social marginalisation.
Also the President of the Government of Canarians has announced his wish to visit *Marruecos to keep a dialogue and a road of communication direct with the #moroccan Government, in the line of fine *vecindad that it has to characterise the relations among two neighbouring villages and civilised, since, many times, the viscosity of the reality -as well it said the #another day the Mr. *Obiols in the debate in *Bruselas, in relation with the common destination among *Europa and *Marruecos- do not allows many times act of the most convenient way.
The report of the Central Bank European explains that there are #some distortions to reach some greater levels of growth -or a greater stability in the European Union or a greater competitiveness in a process of economy open, needs even more stressed taking into account the perspective of the Round of the #Millenium-, precisely because lacking for deepening still in #some structural looks: from the labour markets until, as it has quoted , the system of training, or well looks that are equally important, as for example an improvement in the levels of investigation and development.
And it receives an impulse balanced, because it treats , on the one hand, to favour the Inner Market, to favour the economic integration with the directive on judicial acts and *extrajudiciales in civil and commercial matter, but, on the other hand, treats  also to give primacy to the rights of the persons, to the rights of the human beings, to the rights of the boys, that, in addition to having to suffer the trauma that is always a divorce, do not have to suffer the trauma of the bureaucratic drama of the recognition of the judicial decisions.
Essentially, establish it following: a reduction of the current content in tar of the cigarettes; the introduction for the first time of a limit of the content in nicotine of the cigarettes; the introduction of limits of monoxide of carbon; greater and better labels in the packages of cigarettes relative to the dangers of the habit to smoke, to the content in tar, nicotine and monoxide of carbon of the cigarettes; controls on an utilisation of the soft "qualifications" and "low content of tar", etc.; and new *salvaguardias on the additives of the tobacco.
Gentleman President, is an insult to the consciousness and to the ethical #european politics that, after a military intervention of the NATO and of the European Union against *Yugoslavia, under the flag of reasons humanitarian, by the condemnable ethnic cleansing made by the #yugoslav Administration among the Albanians, in this moment are pretty much calm and sympathetic in front of a violence against the #serbian, #gipsy and other minorities, caused this time by the Albanians, besides with a comparatively upper proportion.
I have said that the report is excellent no only because, precisely, goes back to centre the two terms of the question -action combined of reduction of the demand and of reduction of the offer- but also, *permítame that say it Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, by the sincerity with that criticises it that continues being insufficient in the proposal of the Commission so much from the point of sight financial and economic -#can not  bill the importance of a battle and afterwards not being consistent in financial terms- as from the point of sight, say it like this, of the political timidity of the initiatives that the States still have not taken.
As a result of said resolution, the Technical Group of Independent Deputies (mixed Group) is considered existent and assimilates it  to the other political Groups in #all the planes: in the plane of the parliamentary activity, the Group has immediately of #all the rights recognised by the Regulation to the political Groups properly constituted and in the administrative and financial plane said Group has right to the necessary personnel for his operation, #as well as to the credits assigned to the political Groups, according to the keys of cast existent.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0074/1999) of the Mr. *Pronk, in name of the Delegation of the Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the conjoint text, approved by the Committee of Conciliation, of directive of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres (*Decimoquinta Managerial specific with arrangement to the section 1 of the article 16 of the Directive 89/391/*CEE) (*C5-0221/1999 - 1995/0235(*COD)).
Subject: Assignment of the 1 % of the *FSE for a bottom of capital social In the context of the reform of the structural Bottoms, #can the Council guarantee that it will keep the proposal of the Commission to allocate the 1 % of the *FSE to a bottom of capital social given the importance to provide a fast access to the help of the *FSE to the *ONG and taking into account also the experience of a system of this type in the «Program of Peace and Reconciliation» of *Irlanda of the North?
That the financial Regulation do not adapts  to the requirements of a modern management and of an effective control, or even that the investigations of the unit of fight against the fraud tend to prolong  too much time, to obtain microscopic results. #This *constataciones correspond to it that my Group poses from takes long, to the equal on the other hand, that the technical solutions that propose , already treat  to reinforce the internal audit, the fight against the fraud, the transparency and the obligation of *rendir explain by the Commission.
Regarding the measures in the field of the rural development, *yo already had signalled that I also consider this second *pilar of the agricultural politics like a complement important and the Commission will propose, therefore, an increase limited of the endowment for measures of promotion of the rural development, also with the purpose to offer to the States members an incentive so that they make greater efforts in the field of the protection *agroambiental and in the creation of structures that guarantee the security of the alimentary chain.
They are, of course, the budgetary question, the question of a fragmentation or *pulverización of the actions considered excessive and liable to diminish the public relief of the Union and, in consequence, the question of an option in the that concede  preference to lines that support a greater dimension and *espectacularidad of the initiatives, for it that had foreseen  the participation of agents and cultural operators that cover a high number of countries like minimum, it that, to our understand, #would comport a grave risk of hypertrophy of #some networks of cultural operators, to the *conferirles an excessive concentration of means and powers, with it that #would put  in *entredicho the normal operation, and even the existence, of #many of the remaining.
In a period in the that the popular movements struggle by the complete abolition of the nuclear arms and the world-wide public opinion glimpses the risks of a *reavivamiento of the nuclear antagonism and demands the reduction of the military costs and the *alejamiento of the danger of a nuclear disaster, the *EUA take #gala of a posture extremely *provocativa that mine #all attempt of stabilisation of the international relations and undermines deliberately the configuration of a climate of peace international and security.
Pose seriously the problem of the full employment #would be to put in *entredicho the relevance of the elimination of the borders, but on *eso will not have a conversation , as it #would be necessary *oponerse to the *mundialismo; it #would be to pose the question of the relevance of the excess of taxation and of the bureaucracy, but on *eso will not have a conversation , as it #would be necessary *oponerse to the doctrines of the socialism; it #would be to pose the question of the relevance of the politics of immigration, that weighs on the employment, by not talking of the costs that induces, but on *eso will not have a conversation , because it #would be necessary *oponerse to the only thought.
*Ello Includes from obtaining a distribution and a greater flexibility in the management of the aerial space in his civil and military uses -and *eso in #some countries #can achieve  with #one some rapidity, it is necessary to promote it and are working in *ello- until, also in the short term, take part in the management that are taking the airports and also the aerial companies of his forecasts of flights and in the organisation of these flights, to improve the use and the efficiency in the use of the spaces in the airports, the *slots.
As I entrust in that it will deploy #all his efforts to ensure that our external politics answer to criteria of balance, in that it will reaffirm definitely his priority in the process of homologation in terms of political and economic development of #all those countries that, as *nosotros takes already almost 25 years, *transitan of an autocratic diet to #another of freedoms, in that *asentará for ever the peace in #european floor, but also will ensure our leadership in #all the #mediterranean extension, another priority so much in economic terms as of security, and in that *salvaguardará with efficiency our interests in *América Latin, for example ensuring the fulfillment of the commitment subscribed with the Government of the States Joined around the application of the Law *Helms-*Burton.
I #can manifest, for having chaired yesterday the meeting of #all the groups of this Parliament during the put ready of a project of resolution common that, to the contrary that #some #others, will not be a text of commitment, and in any form of a commitment among divergent positions, but a synthesis enriched of the proposals of each #one of the political families gathered, in a common will to contribute the contribution of this Parliament to a political solution to the drama that is *ensangrentando *Chechenia today.
And especially, it #would say, in relation with #one of the fundamental questions, that is the *litigio *grecoturco on the *Egeo, do not exists, is not a necessary requirement the recognition express by *Turquía, no of the points of sight of another country, but yes of the commitment that it will respect the international right, the commitment that it will not resort to the violence and will not loom with resorting to the violence, and that in the case that they persist the differences will attend to the International Court of The there #be Is #this a necessary condition for his recognition like country candidate to the adhesion?
The importance of the negotiations that go  to celebrate in the field of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, that will initiate  in *Seattle the next day 30 November, has to , obviously, to an agenda that includes vast spheres of the human activity: of the agriculture to the cultural looks; of the transports to the education and the health; of the rights of author and the denominations of origin to the foreign investment; and all *ello amalgamated in a world-wide perspective and as #if all *eso was not but simple "commodities" that #can be object of transactions.
Finally, I want to underline only two points that, on the base of our #italian experience, result especially important and significant: first, the importance to support the scientific investigation of base to know better the phenomenon and, to be possible, know with *antelación #which will be the calls drug of the future, in particular know the power *devastador of the synthetic drugs; second, the importance to involve in our actions to the main actors, #that that are in first line, in the trenches #all the days and that loan help to the *toxicómanos, or was, the experience of the centres of detoxication.
Regarding the practical application, it important now is that the Commission of the EU and the States members manifest also in the concrete cases the will of not to limit to ascertain the rapes of the human rights and, therefore, also of an essential component of the agreement, but to apply also the planned juridical sanctions in each case, that by general rule begin with a query and #can get until the partial suspension of the agreement or even of his whole.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, after the report published the year happened on *Turquía by our colleagues the *Srs *Macmillan-#Scott and *Swoboda, #as well as the resolution of our Parliament of the past 6 October, that put of relief the importance of the deepening of the #european strategy bear with this country, our Assembly #would have to can adopt tomorrow two proposals of regulation of the Parliament and of the relative Council to the execution of actions directed to the economic and social development of *Turquía, the first, and to the deepening of the Union *Aduanera among the European Community and *Turquía.
In the measure in that the new necessary changes of the institutions, or even institutions entirely new, like the new military body so important that has decided , *nos situate in front of difficult dilemmas on how assign the power among the national and community authorities, do not forget the message of the *UEM: that the community institutions succeed *cuando applies  correctly the principle of subsidiariness and *cuando the strength of his powerful partners sees  balanced by the consolidation of the rights of the feeblest partners.
The intervention of the European Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission will contribute no only to protect with greater solidity a group of interests that specified  opportunely, but also to reaffirm an authentic leadership of the European Union so that Chinese #can not leave to see in *ella a preferential speaker in a *geoestrategia linked to the peace, the construction of the democracy, the *salvaguardia of the human rights, the development, the dialogue and the modernity in the plane of the world-wide scene.
Lady Speaker, this report contains #some interesting confessions: I read in the considering *F that exists a persistent differential of growth with the States Joined; in the considering *J read that the very high fiscal pressure of the majority of the #european States do not favours neither the consumption, neither the growth neither the employment; in the paragraph 4, the speaker recognises, with reason, the modest performance of the European Union in terms of growth and of employment; in the paragraph 16, ascertains  that the public investments no always enjoy of preference concerning the costs of operation; in the paragraph 23, the speaker says that it is convenient to keep #alert in front of eventual perspectives *deflacionarias.
From 1998, the Commission has funded programs of humanitarian help of the order of a million of euros to improve the situation of the population of *Anjouan in matter of nutrition and health, and the Commission finishes to approve a new program, by an amount of 730.000 euros, allocated to the sanitary assistance of primary character, and is studying  the suitability to concede an additional program of humanitarian help given the existent needs in the three islands by cause of the political unsteadiness.
*Me Allow to suggest that to avert surprises in the future, the Council and the Parliament watch very of wall the mission of maintenance of the peace of the Nations Joined, the plan of help humanitarian of *Europa, the integrity of any current program or future allocated to put term to the suffering of the population of *Timor to guarantee his full independence and his free sovereignty of #all threat, interference or pressure *proveniente of the #indonesian soldiers and of his #american advisers.
It do not fits doubt that the resumption of the process of peace after the end of the Government of the Mr. *Netanyahu, the election of #Barak and the new agreement signed in *Sharm the *Sheikh are a step advance with regard to the *tinieblas of the past, after the murder of the prime minister *Rabin; without embargo, the path is still difficult before achieving a stable and durable peace that the Palestinians #can live, #such as it establishes  in the resolutions of the Organisation of the Nations Joined, in a Palestinian State that expect that it was democratic and #can *coexistir peacefully with the State of #Israel.
The support of the Commission to the reconstruction and to the development #would have to centre then in the following fields: in the first place, the establishment of the state of right and the democratisation of the national institutions; second, the demobilisation and the socioeconomic reintegration of the belligerent groups; in *tercer place, the restoration of the environment, especially in the provinces of *Kivu and *Orientale; in chamber place, the reconstruction of the infrastructure of transports; and finally, the improvement of the services of health and sanitary.
Likewise *me cheers that the Mr. *Vitorino have announced the Monday in the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects that the Commission goes to present early a study on the concrete realisation of this project as I create really that #if #ours police forms  jointly in the #european spirit and #if, #such as it foresees  in the resolution, includes  also from the principle to the police of the countries candidates -proposed that comes from also of this Assembly-, then will give an important concrete step to #one *Europa of the right and of the inner security.
With our amendments wanted to reach a simplification of the structures, an improvement of the communication with the objective group, a transparent configuration of the executive procedures, a greater participation of disadvantaged groups and a greater diffusion of the informations on the program to reach a better access and, finally, #one *flexibilización of the limits of age of the participants to find to the dessert an approach of solution horizontal in the *comitología.
#If I have accepted, finally, *adherirme to the resolution that will subject  to vote of our colleagues, is because I have been able to *percatarme of the true emotional state of a part of the world-wide public opinion; these worries, joined to the words pronounced previously on the reaction of the #japanese Government and of other international organisms, that ask to the populations that take cautions, that procure  reservations of foods, in forecast of this end of the world announced, *me confirm in the idea that the cautions *preconizadas by our Parliament are, because of his prudence, able to appease the fears, and, therefore, #can be useful.
#The same works in the definition of a system of courts of arbitration in the line of the traditional practice, in that the courts are constituted by citizens chosen in the different levels of the local administration, and that will judge, in principle, three categories of accused: the common murderers, on the one hand, the accused to strike and injure without *ocasionar the death, by #another, and, finally, the *saqueadores, of #such mood that the instigators and the ideologists of the genocide and of the slaughterings are sure enough judged by ordinary courts, that treats , in some mood, to organise to face up to this task.
Of this way the youngsters, especially the less accommodated and more disadvantaged will be able to see in the program *SOCRATES a possibility of integration, cultural enrichment and professional training, but first of all a possibility to have a personal experience, a vital experience to purchase the flexibility and the necessary mental opening to confront it better possible the occupational challenges of the world of the work. By #this *SOCRATES is a big investment for the #european youth.
The text of the amendment that *les propose #would be the following: "According to the Resolution of the European Parliament of 18 November 1999, the conclusion of agreements allocated to *sufragar actions in favour of *Rusia in the frame of the budget of the financial exercise 2000 remains suspended, excepting the line *TACIS for the democracy, until it find  a satisfactory solution to the conflict of *Chechenia, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Union and on the base of the clear-cut procedure in the article 13 of the present Regulation" .
A concrete action made in this sense was the requirement presented by the #finnish Presidency in the session of the 54 General Assembly of the UN that the international community aspire with *tesón to find the solutions and the timely answers to confront the new and unpredictable challenges in the frame of the international humanitarian Right; likewise, the EU has the intention to take out to *relucir this question in #all the international contacts.

I have to say, gentleman Commissioner, that the modification of the juridical base that has established the group of work of the Council, with the that without #a lot of enthusiasm and with #a lot of scepticism have had to *conformarnos, threat with putting end to a considerable part of our joy and threat, likewise, with *aguarnos the party. As #Maria #Colombo *Svevo finishes to say, the violence against the boys and the women do not constitutes only a risk for his health; it is a true rape of his fundamental human rights.
#That is the reason by the that have indicated in the Annex *V of our Regulation that needed no a simple majority, but also a special majority of the deputies to the Assembly -an absolute majority- for *denegar the approval of the management, because, #if no, the denial of the approval of the management #can have been an exit by the door of backwards to censor to the Commission by a lower majority that the usually necessary, with arrangement to the Treaty.

We have seen that the EU occupies  of sectors and questions that now affect to the lives of the citizens of the European Union of form very direct: the launching of the euro, that early will not be a simple instrument for the banks and the institutions, but also the coins and the notes that will carry in the pocket our citizens, and this week the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with his greater insistence in politics that affect to the citizens and, in particular, in the creation of places of work.

The fact to have in the core of the system of the taking of decisions an organism of representatives of complete time with #all the diversity that represent, calling to the doors, taking #telephone calls, taking uncomfortable questions, *sondeando, interrogating, studying in detail the subjects and going back to the regions to talk of *ello with the groups of interest, the unions, the employers, the groups of consumers and the local governments in his regions.
Now well, this agreement of *Berlín has remained still very far of the positions of the European Parliament: it do not has  *reequilibrado the *PAC properly in the sense of the equity and the cohesion, the disadvantaged and peripheral regions follow loomed of depopulation and desertisation, have not created  conditions to apply in the practice the #european model of agriculture, have not created  conditions so that the European Union present  with an offensive posture in the next negotiations of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
The disloyal competition to the that confronts  the sector -a sector that goes, on the other hand, from the production of fibres, *hilados and tissues, until the of the finishings-, sees  aggravated, besides, by the barriers *arancelarias and no *arancelarias that #all the norms established in the breast of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade prevent his access to the markets of countries like the Indian, States Joined or #the same *Turquía, as #if these norms only governed for the community markets, to the that these countries -the products of these countries- yes #can access freely.
Leave that the States members reduce the VAT in services with a big component of hand of drama and that do not have repercussions *transfronterizas; renew the upsetting that takes  in the investigation and the development and take a more imaginative use of the money of the European Bank of Investments, for example, with the creation of a line of credit #european for the technology; introduce changes in the organisation and the time of work with the end to share better the available work.
From the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, on 1 May, the procedure of *codecisión, that supposes the maintenance of narrow relations among the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, covers at present a wide series of politics that comprise #among others the sector of transports, the regional subjects, the social subjects, the initiatives for the employment, the structural Bottoms, the protection of the consumer, the public health and the environmental looks.
It That *sucedió after the referendum deserves the greater conviction, of course, because Indonesian executed a plan of genocide that #can not leave doubt #any on his nature: demographic genocide, promoting the escape of hundreds of thousands of *timorenses; cultural genocide, because from the *primer day of terror the central white, from the point of sight of the institutions, went the #catholic Church, the temples, the episcopalian houses, the parents, the sisters, the faithful, is to say, the traditional institution in that the *timorenses deposited his confidence.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity that *me offers the presence here today of the Commissioner to propose - to the light of the exceptions that already exist in the European Union for the audiovisual companies, that *nos leave a true *margen of manoeuvre, that *nos offer besides the capacity to evolve with the sector and to take a gesture after some rules of the game more *equitativas regarding the States Joined - that, when building the infrastructure for the negotiations, have to be the sufficiently flexible to watch by our needs here in *Europa.
The Council has time for the reflection and the decision on the means: time for the reflection because *nos will gather on 25 November - by Saint #Catalina any tree ruins  and expect that the budgetary tree throw roots -, and the decision on the means *le corresponds to *usted, lady Speaker - and his colleagues, since I know that it #can not it all and regret it -, choose among two roads: the review of the financial perspectives of the category 4 that *nos will allow to vote this budget facing up to the new priorities of compliance with the commitments that have assumed  during the negotiation of this agreement.
In his meeting of 16 July, the Council of Budgets treated of the reallocation of the endowments in favour of *Kosovo and in that moment said  that the Commission #would not have to prejudice to the less developed countries and to the poorest groups and remembered  also the commitment assumed by the Commission with the international strategy for the development, #whose goal is the to reduce to the half the poverty in the world of here to the year 2015.
On the other hand, I wish to take reference to the speakers that have to take into account in the dialogue *macroeconómico and *yo *me *atrevería to suggest that it is necessary to incorporate three more: the representatives of two institutions of the own European Union, as they are the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions -two institutions that represent an economic and social dimension of a big importance and, in the case of the regions, obviously, #some of *ellas play an absolutely indispensable paper to ensure these goals- and, finally, the organisations of small and medium enterprises.
In this sense, is necessary to review the feasibility of the technology, because still they are  developing the devices of control of the able broadcasts to answer to the strict limits of oxides of nitrogen; although in the proofs of laboratory these devices promise a lot, still there #be not security of the operative efficiency on a long-term basis of the devices that the convert in a possible technical solution and durable to make the control of the broadcasts in the long term.
The first are the agreements in matter of investments based in the principles of the statement of the *OIT on companies multinationals and the guidelines of the *OCDE on the rights of the workers. The second is the constitution of a mixed permanent forum *OMC/*OIT commissioned to examine the inclusion of the fundamental labour rights, as for example the abolition of the work *forzoso and the slavery, the proscription of the childish work, the prohibition of the discrimination.
The Report *Schwaiger loads *comprensiblemente more the accent in the *tutelas, nevertheless, believe that it shows a substantial tuning with the proposal of the Commission and, therefore, a full confidence in the work of the Commissioner Mr. *Lamy also regarding this delicate subject, always with the consciousness that the liberalisation of the exchanges also in new fields - as in the case of the investments - answers to the important interest of the countries of the European Union and of #all the countries by a durable and sustainable development of the world-wide economy.
Although the Conservative Party British  *opone officially in principle to that in virtue of the article 63 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam move  to the *primer *pilar the politics in matter of visas, immigration and asylum -by which *me see forced to be in disagreement with it that has said our speaker about this question-, instead are resolved adherents that there #be cooperation *intergubernamental in relation with the *tercer *pilar by means of the collective action of the Council about the exchange of this type of information, included the related with the documents of trip falsified, to end to struggle against the delinquency and in particular against the international delinquency that do not respects the national borders.
Of #where have to take out the conclusion that it #can not  in fact work of another way that the that there #be, as we argue on legal bases, debate absurdly on illegal immigration - #this is very well for the Congress of the Party *Tory, but is not effective in *Europa -, and lose from #all point of sight the opportunity to take it that necessarily #would have to, #this is, an effective legislation to limit the fake of documents so much by #that that like this buy a way to go in illegally in *Europa as also by #that #others that, as it has explained very well the Mrs. *Gebhardt, circulate by *Europa with a case of heroine and false documents.
And #if the integration of *Turquía to the European Union answers to the requirements of the great industrial groups and commercial, especially #european and accessorily #turkish, will not contribute to improve the conditions of the hard-working mass of this country, of #the same mood that the Union has not protected of the unemployment and of the degradation of his conditions of existence to the workers of the already integrated countries.
To the light of #that *dictamen of the Scientific Committee on the Health and the Animal Welfare, the Commission - to #mine initiative in his meeting of 28 October- approved a decision in the that proposed a permanent prohibition of the commercialisation and the utilisation of the *BST in the Community from 1 January 2000, of compliance with the disposals established in the Decision 98/58/*CE of the Council on the protection of the animals of breeding.
And we reiterate that the security in the sector of the transports has to be a priority in the #european politics of transports and, therefore, ask, as I took in a question to the Commission, that the own Commission elaborate in the short term, better said, urgently a directive on the systems of security compulsory for the tunnels and the galleries of roads and underline the fundamental importance of a directive that establish the protocols and controls in road of the reliability of the commercial vehicles that circulate by the roads of *Europa.
By #all these reasons, urge to the European Parliament to that it approve a resolution in the that signals  to the attention of the entities of Indonesian the need to reestablish the legality, the need to finish with the slaughterings, the need that the strengths armed defend to the populations and no the attack, the need to release to *Xanana *Gusmãor, the need that the Nations Joined follow supporting the management that has taken *Portugal so that it reestablish  the peace in *Timor Oriental and in #all Indonesian.
Gentleman President, all #that that read in a book of history on the recent past of *Camboya and all #that that have had the luck, among *comillas, to take a trip by this country, #can not conceive that at all it have manifested  the intention to create an international court to judge to the authors of the *killing *fields and of the massacre that, as very well has signalled the Mr. *Bourlanges, constitutes #one of the most regrettable crimes *acecidos after the *segunda world-wide war.
This situation has to  to a large extent to that the simplest tasks have disappeared of our societies, to that the differences in the performance of the persons are increasing enormously and to that determined labour activities are  *remunerando with wages truly exaggerated, even #if other activities #can in fact result more productive in the traditional sense of the term, in case that they followed forming part of the labour market; but all #this do not results of any acceptable way from a point of sight social or of respect to the human dignity.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished colleagues in a period of big agitation, was by the conflict of *Kosovo, was by any #another, have in the European Parliament once again the obligation to talk of a subject that *nos comes occupying from takes long, the commercial fight with the #EE.UU. The States Joined insist in a posture, was in the case of the bananas that perhaps to his mood to see was solved, was now in the case of the hormones, in the that it is extraordinarily difficult to put the measure in his spot so that also out of the European Union #can comprise , as the *disensiones commercial of the that treats  here constitute hardly the 2 % of the common trade.
#Many of *nosotros, therefore, expected that today *usted, to move away the #sad and unfair initial coincidence that hangs on his new mandate and after 40 days of war in *Kosovo, *Montenegro, Serbian and *Voivodina, #would find the appropriate words to take a call to the immediate #alto the fire, and the words of solidarity by #all the innocent victims, of #all the parts involved, #as well as practical proposals for the reconstruction of the territories devastated and for the fast return of the refugees: the research, gentleman President *Prodi, of a #european soul, as it said a day in this Plenary.
A formal convergence, by the contrary, conducts to unconformities in the results of the politics.2.An only economic politics, managed by the Union, constitutes a grave rape of the national independence and a rape of the national parliaments. The prerogatives of #this in matters of economic politics constitute an indispensable part of the #democracia.3.la political defended in the report (and in the speech) represents a unilateral theoretical thought and a singular political theory.
To which adds  that the Council also has *infringido doubly the spirit and the sense of the Treaty, since, with the introduction of an extraordinary tax allocated to adapt the income of the #european deputies to the national diets *desvirtúa the goal of the Treaty to establish the equality of deal among the #european deputies and goes back to introduce the inequality by the rear door, for saying it like this.
The explanation of #some administrative services that already we had to it have known the past week and that we had to have anticipated and thought it that we wanted to take #can be very interesting from the point of sight of the juridical theory, but is not of receipt that today have a first reading, that the report send  to the Commission of Transports, that to his time do not gathers , and that the administrative service modify my report of the past week and declare that there #be a report for the *segunda reading.
In the text *nos have agreed with the Council that before the approval of the budget of the European Union always take place a meeting *tripartita additional, in the that among the Council, the Parliament and the Commission agree  the form in the that #can cover  an eventual need -the past year had the help to *Rusia- with resources no released of the common budgetary year or also how have to treat  needs of the consecutive budgetary year and how have to *ponernos entirely of agreement before the approval of the Budget.
Gentleman President, is natural that exist fields in the that *nos had enjoyed to get more far after two years of negotiations about the #european regional help for the next seven years. It fits to mention, #among others, some clearer commitments, frames of association by part of the local and regional authorities, more guarantees still for the respect of the terms in the payment to the contractors of the projects and the establishment of a specific figure for the capital of risk social in favour of the voluntary organisations smaller.
While we follow expecting the adoption of measures concrete directed to respect the agreements *multilaterales on the environment -in particular, on the climate and the biodiversity- or to reflect in facts the decisions of the Summit of *Copenhague in matter of fight against the poverty, the committees of the *OMC impose his law to the democracies -and, in particular, to the European Union- and gives  to the freedom of the exchanges the priority on #all the other considerations, already treat  of public health, environment, human rights or social rights.
In the meeting Council of Justice and Interior of 3 December 1998 approved  a plan of performance of the Commission and the Council with regard to the effective application of the points of the Treaty of *Amsterdam for the creation of a #european space of freedom, justice and security; among the measures to carry out in the next two years contemplates  the editorial of a list of the countries, #whose citizens will be able to travel to the States members of the EU without visa, and of the countries that will need it.
In front of this situation, the diet no only do not shows a minimum will to initiate political and economic reforms, but that, by the contrary, reinforces the submission of the population *norcoreana and keeps a total control on the missions of experts and on the medical and alimentary help supplied by the international community to the population *norcoreana (600.000 tonnes of cereals in 1998 and 530.000 in 1999) to the not allowing to the international organisations verify the utilisation and the efficiency of the help.
In this sense had been unforgivable that, *cuando in *Sudáfrica dismantles  that diet *odioso, *cuando the #south african take history and give example producing an admirable reconciliation, surpassing with hit the always difficult transition of a civil war and a dictatorship, transition of the diagrams of a movement of release to the constitution of a Been pluralist, democratic and of Right, had been scandalous, say, that *cuando *ellos, the #south african, have not defrauded our confidence in his behaviour, *nosotros Europeans did not know to be to the height of the circumstances and defrauded the confidence that from *África of the South has deposited  in *nosotros.
Subject: On the possible suppression of the General Direction of Fishing Is true - as they finish to announce the media - that, in spite of the word given by the Commissioner of Agriculture *Fischler in his appearance in front of the Commission of Fishing of the European Parliament, the European Commission has decided to suppress the General Direction of Fishing (General Direction *XIV), measure that prejudices clearly to the interests *pesqueros #european and, especially, to the interests of regions dependent of the fishing, as it is the case of *Galicia?
To follow forward with the contrary politics to the capital pity, to consolidate the attainments of the Committee of Rights Human and to carry the question of the pity of death to the program of the General Assembly of the Nations Joined, the States members of the European Union have resolved to present a resolution in the Third Commission during the *quincuagésimo chamber period of sessions of the General Assembly.
It #would be #naïve, clear, expect a distinct approach by part of the organisms of the EU, *cuando the community budget and the national budgets move  in the hard and *antipopular mark of the criteria of *Maastricht and of the *draconianas reductions of costs; *cuando the external politics of the EU characterises  by a hypocrisy that did not knows limits, by the control more *opresivo, and by the every time greater submission of the countries, #as well as by the open intervention and generalised in his internal subjects, as they show the process of enlargement and the Pact of Stability for the *Europa *suroriental.
This conception #would conduct directly, according to the ancient professional deformation of the Commission, to concede the primacy to the free circulation of the commodities on the health of the consumers, as we finish to see in the subject of the embargo of the meat of bovine #british, in the that it #would be necessary, lady Speaker, expect to that have  of the proofs, it that *nos conducts, by it other, to the extraordinary following conclusion: the that inside the European Union did not applies  the principle of caution, whereas it tries  take that it prevail in the relations with third countries, in particular with the States Joined.
The Commission also #can support the relative amendments to the enlargement of the directive to include other alternative fuels, in east marry ethanol; the amendment that refers  to the fiscal incentives applied to the *reequipamiento of old vehicles; the amendment that includes the heavy vehicles in the community general strategy referred to the dioxide of carbon and the relative amendment to the commercial quality of the liquid petrol.
It has had knowledge the Commission of the opening of an investigation, or of appeal of information or of recommendations to reach agreements, by part of the Department of State of the #EE.UU., directed to the Group Sun-*Meliá, with previous character to the application to this group and to other companies of the EU (Club *Med, *LTU), in frank rape of the Agreements reached among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the frame of the Transatlantic Summit, that excluded of the field of application of the Law *Helms-*Burton to the #european companies?
#If we split of the premise that a world-wide trade freer and juster has been the foundation that has allowed to improve the level of welfare of #a lot of States and his populations, especially in the case of the countries in development, then also have to recognise that the European Union, in his quality of greater commercial power of the world, has an elementary interest in continuing promoting this favourable evolution and in that an increasing number of villages and of States take part in #the same.
To measure that increases the number of competitors international in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, precisely in the rich nations and especially in the States Joined, that are those who more have benefited  of the liberalisation of the markets, is growing -paradoxically, wanted to add *yo- the scepticism and the worry in front of the possibility that the globalisation also carry rigged an impoverishment, the destruction of the environment and the loss of sovereignty national.
The Commission of Control Budgetary proposes  answer in his writing of opinion to the *interrogante on the suitability to tackle the development of the controls and an effective protection of the community finances by means of the creation of a charge of public prosecutor #european according to the diagram proposed in the "*Corpus *Juris" , but in the sense of the subsidiariness, #such as *nos posed and cleared the past week in the session of *Bruselas the gentleman Commissioner *Barnier.
They have achieved  pose with considerable clarity and of consistent way the political requirements associated to the cooperation with *Turquía, in particular the need that they respect  and develop  the human rights, among *ellos the rights of the village *kurdo, the requirement of the abolition of the pity of death, the strengthening of the civil society, a greater participation of the no governmental organisations and the reduction of the social disadvantages and of the regional underdevelopment.
In this sense, tomorrow will propose -to the contrary of it that, apparently, think #others- the postponement of the vote of the two reports for a period of sessions back and ask to the Speaker of the European Parliament that, in name of the institution that chairs, formulate a request expresses to the European Council of *Helsinki so that, #if it keeps  the decision of the #turkish authorities, the Council adopt a very firm position in relation with the candidature of *Turquía to the European Union.
Without leaving to respect the confidentiality of the conversations, *yo #can *decirles, in any case, that my personal impression is that the #turkish Government did not wishes to take in any case a decision on the execution of the sentence while it last the procedure of *Estrasburgo, but that his strategy is directed rather to take advantage of the like this won time to abolish the pity of death in *Turquía.
But I believe that no  *le #can dribble to the Presidency in exercise of the Council the merit that they have produced  substantial advances in the field of the external politics and of common security reorganising the works of the Council, giving a clear impulse to the no military management of the crises, adopting the common strategy on the case of *Ucrania and adopting also a statement in the case of *Chechenia, although to *nosotros *nos had enjoyed that it went a bit more conclusive and believe that the time *nos will give the reason.
Also it suits to remember that, in the report of the Court of Accounts that finishes to #make  and that have debated this week, have not found in #all the agricultural sector any indication of swindle massive or fraud on a large scale, but have observed that seems to have *muchísimos problems to the hour to reckon the number of livestock, the quantity of hectares by help to surface, etc. Exist small errors in a very wide field and *eso constitutes a grave problem that owe *encarar.
I have to say again that the political intentionality of the Treaty was the to integrate the Secretariat of *Schengen existent in the also existent General Secretariat of the Council without hiring new collaborators or summon procedures of selection of any type, as it #can not be reasonable that #if a task has been made up to now by a Secretariat that goes to be integrated afterwards in #another,  solvent the subject planting to 80 new persons according to the applicable norms to the general Secretariat and that put in the street to the 80 persons that have taken until then the work of the Secretariat of *Schengen.
In the European Union today, for well or for bad, although still there are national cultural traditions, the basic principles, the principles of order public, the principles of the protection of the morals, of the right and of the minors, follow valid and, therefore, believe that, in this moment, really a directive like the current goes to facilitate the integration of our legislations by means of the defence of some common principles to #all the States members.
Lady minister, from the past 11 February, in that it reacted in front of the first informations on the slaughterings in *Kosovo, our Parliament has not ceased to report the atrocities committed in this province, in the that unchained  once again the *infernal gear of the violence and of the fear, cause of *tantos sufferings by the systematic rape of the most elementary rights of the human being, in first row of the *cuales appears the to remain in the floor that has seen it be born and conserve the culture in the that has raised .
This approach of the interior of the crisis that crosses the Commission (crisis to the that confront  #all the #european institutions) #would contribute, in my opinion, to situate effectively the analyses of the independent experts in his global political context, characterised (to use the terms of the document of the mentioned Cell of *Prospectiva) by the exhaustion of some form to organise the public action, by a crisis of authority that affects of full to the Union.
In the category *I "agricultural costs, support to the markets" are already to the limit of the *margen; in the category *IV "external actions" - will go back on *ello - the category literally explodes, in the category *V do not know it that will cost the administrative reform of the Commission, but see with #a lot of worry how outlines  the problem of the retirements without that have foreseen  the costs adapted; and in the category *VII allocated to the *preadhesión, the movement in favour of a faster enlargement and wider, #if it #can say  like this, do not enjoys of the credits adapted.
The Scientific Committee has shown clearly his *convencimiento that the meat of bovine #british is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of any part of the European Union and in these circumstances am safe that the Commissioner will suit *conmigo in that a delay of only some days is better that the of two or three years in the courts, it that finishes frustrating to #everyone, do not satisfies to nobody and, in particular, do not satisfies to the #british graziers that have observed the law, have taken it that  *les has asked and are now in conditions to sell an excellent product in #all the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0056/1999), in name of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, concerning the common position, approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a program of action community (Program *DAPHNE) (2000-2003) on preventive measures allocated to combat the violence exerted on the boys, the teenagers and the women [9150/1/1999-*C5-0181/1999 - 1998/0192(*COD)] (Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea).
I believe that it is just to affirm that it exists general consensus in the European Union - among the Council, the Parliament and the Commission - on the two following proposals: in the first place, in spite of the comprehensible indignation by the appalling acts of terrorism in *Moscú, in the *Cáucaso North and in other parts - that like citizen of a country that has suffered *demasiadas experiences of terrorism condemn totally -, the #russian action during the last weeks has supposed a reiterated deployment of a disproportionate military strength, the reiterated contempt of the need to look for a political solution and the reiterated contempt of the tragic consequences for the persons.
Without embargo, fifty years after the Universal Statement of the Human Rights, know that they do not exist rights conquered #all at the same time and for ever: I think in the *Tíbet, *Birmania, *Timor and in the #asian countries in that it explodes  the childish and feminine work; I think in *Kosovo, in *Chechenia or in *África, a continent *demasiadas far times and forgotten; I think in the 790 millions of persons that happen *hambre in the world or in the 300 millions of boys that are forced to work; I think, besides, in the 1.625 executions fulfilled the year happened in the 72 countries that in his legislations keep the pity of death; finally I think in the destination of the leader *kurdo *Ocalan, #whose life has to be saved by means of the effort of #all *nosotros.
And all *ello because, although this Parliament has expressed an indeclinable commitment in favour of a moratorium of the pity of death, as we took in the debate of the last session *plenaria -believe that the Speaker has directed  already to the #turkish authorities by this reason- think that the European Union has to fulfil his commitments and, to #the same time, that #can not leave to recognise that in the last fifteen years in *Turquía has not executed  any pity of death.
It is not only the case *Ocalan that *me takes to say that the candidature of *Turquía is not mature still. Among other things, *Ocalan went practically delivered by the Government of the Mr. *D' *Alema -#one dishonours for #Italia- but, on the other hand, precisely of the penal Code Italian *Turquía has copied this article 155 of his penal Code that has allowed the conviction of *Ocalan - the article 155 of the penal Code Turkish, copied of the article 241 of the penal Code Italian- and, therefore, also the position of the #italian Government in this case no *me has *extrañado at all.
Report (To5-0074/1999) of the Mr. *Pronk, in name of the Delegation of the Parliament for the Commission of conciliation on the text attach, approved by the Commission of Conciliation, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and of the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres. (Commission of Social Subjects and Employment, *Décima *quinta managerial individual relative to the article 16(1) of the Directive 89/391/*CEE (*C5-0221/1991 - 1995/0235(*COD))
will signal that, from fifteen years ago, in *Turquía exists a moratorium in fact on the pity of death; that the goal of the report that, precisely, subject to vote is to incite to the #turkish Government to that this moratorium in fact convert  in moratorium of right; and that, in any case, *me ask #which #would be the reaction of our colleagues #if, in his countries of origin, existed, as *ellos wish, an intrusion of the political power in the judicial power. Since at present the cause of the Mr. *Ocalan is subjected to the Court of Security of *Estrasburgo.
The technical obstacles that #would pose the greater difficulties to reduce the transitory period are, specifically: the terms of manufacture of the notes and of the coins in euros; the considerable importance of the computer adaptations that they have to make, and also the fact that the transition to the euro of the public administrations has been scheduled for the year 2002, to end to take in consideration the complexity of the changes that have to introduce in this sector.
Of compliance with the article 245 of the constitutive Treaty of the *CE, with the article 45 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of the Coal and the Steel and with the article 160 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of the Atomic Energy, the Council #can change the disposals on the maintenance of the secret only to request of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0101/1999) of the Mr. *Papayannakis, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council that modifies the Regulation (*CE) *nº 820/97 of the Council by the that it establishes  a system of identification and register of the animals of the bovine and relative species to the labeling of the meat of *vacuno and the products to base of meat of *vacuno (*COM(1999) 487 - *C5-0241/1999 - 1999/0205(*COD)).
By evident reasons, that have relation with the geography but also with the history, seemed necessary to the Europeans engage, during the years 70, an action of cooperation of *envergadura with the countries of *África, of the *Caribe and of the Peaceful, under a quite original form known with the name of Agreement of *Lomé, and that allowed that our partners of the south benefited  of stable prices for the products of the that extract his main resources, *ello to the coat of a free change in #all directions of the that it only that sees  is how ruins today the most fragile economies.
*Ustedes Will remember the appointment: «this day will happen to the history like a day of infamy», and *ello because the Secretary of State North American, that was perfectly to the common, took to expect in the antechamber during varied hours to the #japanese ambassador that had attended to deliver the statement of war, with the only goal to take out party of the indignation by the attack in front of the North American public opinion and international.
As I believe that it always is possible attenuate the negative effects, stand out three: the reform of the *PAC, to the that associate the feeble expression of the concept of «development rural», as the benefited and prejudiced go to follow, at the end, being #the same of always; the reduction of the public copartnership in private projects producers of income that, when prejudicing to the companies, lessen the employment; the concentration of bottoms of the next community frame in the first years, that, together with the balances that go out of *él, will create complex conditions of utilisation of the structural Bottoms, as known is that, #if they do not use , lose .
Likewise it wanted to express the opinion shared by the absolute majority of the Commission of Freedoms Public and of Inner Subjects that it do not treats  of the rights of the Parliament, by important that are, but that the Parliament pretends *erigirse in lawyer of the fundamental rights, the rights of the citizens and the rights of the person in the European Union. Now well, it results enormously difficult to assume this have to that we have to fulfil of face to the #european citizens *cuando the Council *nos excludes of his activities.
Without embargo this question follows without answer and is: -#If it knows the Council that, in accordance with the complaints and informations that spread the international media, the bombardments of the NATO and the war of *Yugoslavia have caused catastrophes or damages *irreparables in monuments of the cultural heritage European -among the *cuales also there are churches and #christian monasteries (#orthodox).-#If they show  that these data are correct: to)How it thinks to take so that it do not continue this loss *irremediable, *yb)how thinks to take to restore- in the measure of it possible- the damages?Obviously, this question refers , in concrete, to a «cultural crime of war» that takes place in *Europa, in *Yugoslavia, in #where it also takes place a «environmental crime of war».
The withdrawal of the directive on the cars of the meeting of the Council of Ministers by dictated of the Chancellor is a never seen fact and *inaudito, as it neither has precedents in the recent history of the European Union his decision to prevent by dictated the participation of the Minister of Economy #german in the meeting of the Council of Ministers that celebrated  in *Finlandia.
We aspire to that of #the same way in that today it takes it the Parliament, the Council direct from *Tampere an audible message to the #european citizens, the message that the European Union really interests  and works by his more vital interests: the *reforzamiento of the inner security, the free circulation, the free access to the justice, the fight against the delinquency organised international, the control of the borders, the respect of the rights and fundamental freedoms.
The proposal of the Commission to create a #european agency for the reconstruction is based mainly in the recommendations of the Parliament for the reconstruction of *Bosnia - recommendations that aptly take upsetting in the need to decentralise the management of the help to *través of the increase of the participation of personnel local and the contribution of mechanisms that adapt  better to the urgency of the requirements of the reconstruction.
Lady Speaker, in virtue of the article 111 of the Regulation of the European Parliament, propose an amendment to the agenda of this partial period of sessions to include a statement of the Commission on the refusal of the #french Government to raise the embargo of meat and his decision to prevent that the meat of *vacuno of the Realm Joined cross his territory, that is a route forced to get to *España and #Italia.
Subject: Decision on the reconstruction of the regions affected by the seisms in #Grecia After the strong tremors of earth that have affected to the #greek region of the *Ática, causing *decenas of dead persons and damages of a magnitude still no established, #can indicate the Council #if it thinks to proceed to the urgent publication of a decision on the subscription of a loan for the bonus of interests, with regard to reconstructing the economic and social infrastructure, included the house, and reestablish the means of production, #such as it took by means of previous #his decisions in favour of *Portugal, in 1993, and in favour of #Grecia, in March of 1981 and in September of 1986 (Decision 81/1013/*CEE of 14.12.1981 and Decision 88/561/*CEE of 7.11.1988?
Said #this and considering that *nos find in a historical moment of the #european construction with the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice, in front of a debate on a Letter of rights fundamental, and considering likewise the powers awarded to the Council by the Treaties to carry out actions that guarantee these rights of the #european citizens, *me #would enjoy to know the attitude of the Council with regard to the content of said Letter of fundamental rights in matter of protection of sexual freedom and of sexual option more that of sexual orientation.
Without embargo it is necessary to develop painstakingly this system of documentation, extending it also to the torture and to the means employed for the other inhuman and degrading deals, so that the information was to disposal of the national parliaments #as well as of this Assembly before it produce  a greater diffusion and like this the control on the export of arms was effective, having of the suitable political instruments and juridical to take part the transgression of the norms on the systems of control.
In these lines guidelines and in the finance of #many of these politics are included #many of the proposals that have listened  in this hemicycle, #such like special fiscal reductions for the workers and for the small and medium enterprises, like a support to the education or to the training of the workers with seen to the dismissals or to the restructurings, #as well as social packages to reinforce the social network in case of great restructurings, the continuous training and the provision of workers with new aptitudes so that they #can answer to these restructurings.
The amendment 7, that *versa on the actions integrated in agreements of transnational cultural cooperation, composes  of two parts: in the first place, the relative to the paper of the committee and more in particular the obligation by part of the managers of the projects funded to present a balance of the actions undertaken directly to the committee, as this control *incumbe to the Commission, that has to also commission of the management of the program; second, the relative part to the addition of the precision "specialists of the heritage".
#If the Central Bank European considers dangerous a rhythm of growth upper to the 2,5% and, according to the assessments of the Commission, has to have  a rhythm of growth upper to the 3% to reduce the employment to the 7% in 6 or 7 years, then the only path that *les remains, and of course follow *ustedes with coherence, is *presionar to the labour market to cancel the labour relations, impose the work to half day and, more generally, *flexibilizar the employment, reduce really the wages and finish with the social security.
I want to appreciate to the speaker and to the and the colleagues of the Commission of Industry the inclusion in the final report of #many of the looks approved in the Commission of Environment, which #can not  give by discounted neither neither occurs always, and that our aspirations have found fit in the amendments of the speaker and in the amendments of commitment, so that big part of the questions that the Commission of Environment considers important with seen to *Seattle have remained integrated in the report of the Mr. *Schwaiger.
It is an exceptional democratic event that thousands of men and women have debated and have manifested  by a distinct economy, directly linked to the daily life and the democracy, because the fact that 134 governments form part of the World-wide Organisation of Trade do not guarantees of by himself/hisself neither transparency neither democracy in the processes of taking of decisions because, further of the formal statutes, it that *subsiste really is the contractual power of the strongest Governments and of the multinationals that exert it.
Has to include  also in the Treaties this Letter of rights fundamental that goes to elaborate  in the next months; contemplate the taking of decisions by majority -like general norm- and, logically, of simultaneous way, the procedure of *codecisión in these moments; expand also the powers of the European Parliament, for example the capacity to ratify #all the international treaties, was *cual was his type or type; and, of course, contemplate that the next reforms take  in accordance with a much more open method, transparent, democratic and participatory that the current.
Gentleman President, with occasion of the presentation of this bulky report on the human rights, will mention the constant rapes of said rights committed with the foundation of a legislation *estalinista against the intellectuals of #all the specialities that have  brave to issue critical opinions or simply independent concerning the history of the last world-wide war, #whose drama *concentracionario *obnubila increasingly to the media, to the education, to the press, to the service of interests very distinct of the exclusive defence of the memory of the victims.
Apart from his strictly economic meaning, that do not leaves to be great, these institutions have offered to our villages the real proof that the creation of new community institutions attendants of the exercise of a politics integrated in the place of the governments or of the national institutions of the States members do not constitutes a betrayal, but a conjoint exercise more effective of our national sovereignty.
We consider important that there are two representatives of the European Parliament in the preparatory group, but already consider less #worthy for the European Parliament that his Speaker, instead of relating  exclusively with the bosses of State and the prime ministers, see  immersed in a dynamics in the that  the hear before the meetings of the members of the Council of Subjects General and #that is not a #worthy deal for this European Parliament.
We have seen that the Court of Justice has ratified the faculty of the States members to take decisions in this matter and besides, regarding the point that *usted has underlined relative to the distribution inside the territory of a State, have to add that the norms in matter of competition and the principle of no discrimination do not force to the States members to take in account looks of regional character to the hour to award the licences for the casinos neither other permissions to organise games of chance.
It has needed , as, more of a year and varied meetings of the Committee of Conciliation to reach an agreement on this program, #tending to promote the quality of the education to *través of the promotion of the cooperation, of the intensification of the mobility and of the development of the #european dimension in #all the educational sectors, with the end to complete the actions of the States members in this field.
In the case of *Kuwait, it that has *sucedido to finals of November, *cuando with 32 votes against and 30 in favour the Parliament has refused the proposal that the women #can vote and be voted, do not constitutes only a rape of the human rights and a repulsive political action, but also is an infringement of the own #kuwaiti Constitution, that in the article 29 has that #all the citizens are equal in front of the law, independently of the sex, the religion, the race or the ethnic origin.
I have to say that #if we talk of defence and of promotion of the human rights like a fundamental element of the #european identity and of his projection in the world, certainly today *Birmania is #one of the banks of proof fundamental and believe that the best way to express our felt condolence to the Saint Mrs. *Suu *Kiy is intensifying the initiative against the #burmese diet and increasing his international isolation so much from the point of sight political and diplomatic like economic and commercial.
By the contrary, a greater cooperation in the national politics through a consistent put in practice of the guidelines and of the plans of action of the politics of employment, #as well as an improvement of the possibility of control mean #one *plusvalía #european, the *cual together with the effect stabilizer of a solid common coin will contribute also to half term in the inner market European to that we reach more put of work and have less unemployed. #This is an important *prerrequisito of the social dimension of the European Union.
To finalise, #some points that, although they go to be decided by the next Parliament, *nosotros #would have to set up in the next weeks -and, #if it is possible, before the Council *ECOFIN of 25 May- in the frame of the Group of high level: we need a proposal *consensuable in relation with the five members of the Committee of Surveillance, need a profile of the director of the *OLAF so that it #can publish the announcement of the squares; we need an organisation chart of the *OLAF as *prerrequisito and like base of a supplementary budget, as they have recommended it already in his opinion our colleagues of the Commission of Budgets.
The report is in it true when underlining the need to establish a narrower coordination among the great orientations of economic politics and the guidelines in matter of politics of employment, taking into account the need of a coherent strategy for the employment, the growth, the stability and the economic reforms and for an improvement of his content and his opportunity and the relation among the commissions of the Council interested.
The General Secretary of the UN was invited to the extraordinary Summit of the Bosses of State and of Government and has reinforced equally his implication, taken by the *cual also *nos *congratulamos explicitly. Have likewise the satisfaction to be able to *anunciarles a news of the maximum actuality, to know, that after the meeting of yesterday in *Bonn of the Political Directors of the *G-8, in the *cual achieved to reach an agreement on a common foundation, the Thursday will celebrate  in *Bonn a meeting of the Ministers of the *G-8 on the subject of *Kosovo.
The Commission has the impression of that this managerial #such as it exists at present represents a *primer useful step to a fixation of prices just and effective of the transport of commodities by heavy vehicles by road and *nos cheer of the fine disposal of the Parliament and of the Council to give this step. Likewise, we follow taking upsetting in the need to work more in the quantification of the external costs for #all the moods of transport.
We propose to substitute the pact of stability by a true pact of growth with, among other priorities, the relaunching of the productive investment, the continuation of the descent of the types of interest of selective form in favour of the employment, the set up of a process of reduction of the time of work without decrease of wage, the arrest of the process of liberalisation and deregulation, the fixation of a minimum wage in each Been member.
Meanwhile, the taking of decisions after the Summit of *Berlín has carried to the instauration of a budgetary category separate for the adhesion, section *séptimo, in the that will include  also the helps *Sapard, for the that will impose  some financial rules more strict in relation to the *prefinanciación and the management and financial justification that the that they #would be applicable #if the measures had followed in the category 1, agriculture, as it had proposed the Commission, or in the category 2, to the that #would have belonged the measures in case that these countries sure enough had converted  in States members.
Anyway, *ustedes are conscious that the Commission has kept some reservations about the common position, for example, in matter of suitable supervision and regarding the suppression of #some elements of the Annex 2 relative to the additional risks derived of cut of the electrical supply, #as well as to the need to delete manually the automatisms in case that the automatic processes separate  of the conditions of operation planned and, finally, regarding the need to be able to spread or isolate quickly the energy accumulated in case of cut of the supply by #any emergency.
#If deal to find a conductive thread in my commitment, modest, but *tenaz and passionate, along the fifteen years that have worked here, *me seems that I #can find it in the will to contribute to endow to *Europa, to #ours loved *Europa, of effective instruments to guarantee the pluralism of the information, the protection of the creativity, the support to the circulation of the #european dramas, a new impulse to the audiovisual production *valorizando the *irreducibles differentiate of the cultures and converting in strength an apparent weakness.
Therefore, we wanted to direct a concrete message to the Council of Colony, so as to that the #german Presidency ask that it appear in the agenda of the next General Assembly of the Nations Joined this subject and that the #finnish Presidency was the attendant to execute this decision so that -in the month of August, to more take- this subject appear in the agenda and #can be examined sure enough in the next General Assembly of the Nations Joined.
My Group no only pretends to express his worry by the security of the citizens of the European Union, the Czech Republic and the bordering countries, but that, besides, want to loan help to the innovation, to the alternative energies, to other forms of efficiency energetic, in other words, want to boost the use of energies that do not require of nuclear head offices and do not produce the corresponding consumption of electrical energy.
It is an opportunity to explore his promise to collaborate with the Parliament and embrace *decididamente our interest for examining the application of the process of reforms and also his constructive commitment with our worries like deputies by a #european economy that was based in the knowledge, the aptitudes and the creativity and a #european society based in the inclusion, the diversity and the cultural wealth.
So much today, in the speech of the Speaker of the Council, as two weeks ago, in the audition of the Commissioner *Vitorino, have appreciated -*nosotros, the deputies, *habituados to the "*langue of *bois" of the Council and of the Commission- elements of philosophical rigour on the fundamental budgets of this true inner market of the freedom and the justice, is to say, the market of the values -and no already the of the commodities and the services- that *nos inspire an optimism reserved on *Tampere and his consequences. ?Why?
Subject: Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC The past June, the Bosses of State of the European Union, gathered in the Summit of Colony, agreed that the next commercial negotiations of the "Round of the #Millenium" of the *OMC had to include the labour norms, alleging that: "Some negotiations that cover a wide fan of subjects, included the norms of work, environment, development and transparency, constitute the most appropriate base to reach substantial results and balanced in benefit of #all the members of the *OMC".
Subject: Installation of a nuclear head office in a highly exposed zone to seismic movements as it is the region of *Akköy in *Turquía The *tremendo seism, so much in extension as in intensity, that recently has shaken *Turquía, no only has caused considerable damages, but that also *replantea of dramatic form the project of construction of a gigantic nuclear head office of production of electrical energy in the region of *Akköy, to the southwest of *Turquía, project in the that persists the #turkish Government, in spite of treating  of a zone that comports a high seismic risk as they confirm #all the studies carried out by specialists.
. (*FR) The deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations have voted against of the group of the amendments approved in the Commission of Environment, #tending to transform the recommendation of the Commission in directive, and *ello by three essential reasons: relative reason to the bureaucracy, relative reason to the juridical foundation and relative reason to the structure of the bodies of control in the States members of the European Union.
*Cuando The philosophy that conditions the relative proposals centres  in the concept of "citizen according to the law" and of the need of "attribution of responsibilities to those that loom the freedom and the security of the persons and of the society", only #can ascertain the comeback of those theories that in countries like the #ours, went in the happened the base of the laws and the limitations *antidemocráticas, the base to penalise the political and #sindical action.
By a part, the agricultural employers, from takes time and strongly stuck to the train of the rigid conditions of production, guarantee and back fully, as they show it the history and the actuality, the maturity of the consumer; by #another, the possible path to solve the problem is tied to the *proprio consumer that has comprised perfectly the #european politics in matter of marks and of typical products giving validity to the local products Europeans, perfectly able to avert the *aplastamiento in the international competition that, by the contrary, prevails the foods *masificados.
Without embargo, wanted to urge to the Commissioner to that it take *algo more: #if his colleagues and *él are decided to recover the confidence of the consumers and of the alimentary industry in the relative structures to the *inocuidad of the foods of the EU, has to create a #european agency attendant of the similar foods to the Administration of Foods and Medicines of the #EE.UU. Said agency #can assume the current functions of the Commission in matter of inspection and executive in relation with the veterinary legislation, phytosanitary and relative to the hygiene of the foods.
Gentleman President, before going in in matter and of *referirme to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the application of the program *ALTENER with arrangement to the procedure of *codecisión, a time approved the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #would want to express in the first place my satisfaction, my recognition, my gratitude by the support that the Commission has found in #all moment in the European Parliament precisely in the field of the renewable energies.
- (OF) Gentleman President, regarding the subject of the crop of the linen and the problems that there #be had in *España in this context, the Commission already proposed to the Council, in the frame of the package of prices for the year 1996, that established a maximum surface guaranteed for the crop of the linen and fixed some lower helps for the rest, except in the case of the linen *recolectado with traditional methods.
To these foundations it #would be necessary to add, in my opinion, the strategic value of the agriculture in #some exporting regions of the European Union, that, besides, have had in the Treaty of *Amsterdam a singular recognition, as they are the called regions *ultraperiféricas, that need a special consideration in the negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium so that the decisions that take  in *Seattle leave to except his agricultural interests and guarantee his social survival, cultural, economic and environmental, especially after the summit of Colony.
The European Parliament also has worked *denodadamente to put in vigour legislative norms that reduce the utilisation of gases of CO2; for example, the new directive of the European Union on the regulation of agents *contaminantes forces to the oil companies to engage  to achieve that the content of sulphur of the vehicles remain reduced to a third part, and that the content of sulphur of the fuel *diesel remain reduced to #one *séptima splits for the year 2005.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for *segunda reading (To5-0029/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position of the Council (*COM98) 285 - *C5-0029/1999 - 1998/0163(*COD)) with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the velocimeter of the vehicles of engine of two or three tyres and by the that modifies  the Directive 92/61/*CEE of the relative Council to the homologation of said vehicles (Speaker: Mr. *Ferri).
In front of the next negotiations with the *OMC, in the that goes  to include the audiovisual sector, sees  every time with greater clarity it important that are some independent and reliable informations on the situation of the market in *Europa for the attendants to adopt the political decisions, like the community organs, the Governments of the States members, for the organs *decisorios economic and social of the States members and of the regions and for the industry devoted to the investigation, the Universities and the media.
We believe that #if the Commission decides to advance in the review of the total of the directive on the ordination of the time of work and poses from the principle the subject of the rest *dominical, that has been a very debated subject and on the that already there are decisions of the European Court, simply run the danger of not to debate it never and to get another time to a dead end, for looking for *utópicamente it *inmejorable.
#One of the main political conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of Bosses of State or of Government signals the need, with seen to a true politics of migration, to go out of the traditional limits of the justice and the subjects of interior and resort to a series of instruments, in the field of other politics of the Union, conception #this that already advocated the Commission from 1994 and that always has deserved the support of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the Report *DEHAENE includes a proposal of scope historical. It pretends to divide the Treaties in two parts: a constitutional and institutional part that, as it has been the case up to now, only will be able to modify by unanimity by means of a Conference *Intergubernamental and a procedure of ratification of the States members, and a special part reserved to a series of politics concrete for the that the procedure of ratification substitutes  by the *dictamen satisfied of the Parliament.
The problem is not only that it register  an increase of the synthetic drugs and of the import of cocaine in *Europa, although the heroine follows being the main problem; it is that in the last years the drugs have converted  in a conscious threat that emanates of the relation among the crime organised with the traffic of drugs and with the traffic of arms and of nuclear materials, #as well as of the creation of new pertinent criminal organisations of the *Europa Central and Oriental.
These countries have been supported in his work by the International Agency of Atomic Energy, that has reviewed his analyses on the importance of the problem regarding a significant number of head offices; the Mrs. *Plooij-go *Gorsel has mentioned the works made up to now, and #this is my answer, Lady: the works of the Agency and of the countries that explode these head offices have not revealed to have problems of "*bug" in the essential systems for the security.
Also we request the *engarce of this philosophy *arancelaria with a new tax of similar structure to the old *APIM, so as to incorporate it to a package of measures specific of fiscal character that the Council, to proposal of the Commission, has to set up the next year -as they finish to indicate the deputies *Ripoll and *Martínez of *Bedoya and *Medina *Ortega- to *través of the announced permanent statute for the regions *ultraperiféricas -among the that find  the Canarian islands- like development of the article 299.2, that foresees a treatment differentiated, as *ustedes know, of the application of the disposals of the Treaty.
The case of *Corea is, as they already have said varied colleagues, the result of the combination of situations and factors, some interns, other external: the crisis of #Asia, the *hiperdesvalorización in more of the 30% of the national coin -of the *won- and the concomitant support of the #FMI have been the factors that have conducted to this eccentric only -situation, #can say- in that it finds  *Corea, by not talking of the disloyal form as *nos has taken the competition in the last times.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the communication of the Commission on the *salvaguardia of the current sportive structures and the maintenance of the social function of the sport in the community frames, the plan of support community to the fight against the doping in the sport and the participation of the Commission in the Anti-doping World-wide Agency.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0086/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, concerning the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the safe of civil responsibility derived of the circulation of vehicles cars and by the that modify  the Directives 73/239/*CEE and 88/357/*CEE (*cuarta Managerial on safe of vehicles cars) (Speaker: *Rothley)
Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for the adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and his States members, by a part, and the Czech Republic, by #another, to take into account the adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of the Realm of *Suecia to the European Union (9726/1999 - *C5-0191/1999 - 1997/0273(*AVC)) (Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence)
- Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for the adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and his States members, by a part, and the Slovakian Republic, by #another, to take into account the adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of the Realm of *Suecia to the European Union (9727/1999 - *C5-0192/1999 - 1997/0274(*AVC)) (Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence)
*Permítanme say, to finish, that believe that it will have to exist an interrelationship, some relations among the scientists and the jurists and the evaluation of the factors of risk to guarantee with total security that the managers to draft the laws comprise it that say the scientists, and that the scientists are satisfied with the mood in that the jurists draft the laws so that they contemplate the criteria that *ellos have expressed in his *dictamen in the field of the evaluation of the factors of risk.
In the basic shots of the economic politics of the States members and of the Community for 1998/99 underlines  of similar mood that the economic politics of the States members, especially, his financial and monetary politics, that now drops inside the exclusive competition of the Community, #as well as the structural reforms have to support among #if to reach a low inflation that goes parallel to a sustainable and effective growth for the employment.
For being #this much more elevated in the transport by road, with the noise, the atmospheric pollution and the accidents, as *evidencian the charts presented by the speaker, is justified that it was greater the payment that have to take his users, in consonance, by it other, with it that already *sucede now, when paying the users of the roads (in taxes on the fuels and the vehicles and in tolls) the double of the cost that with *ellas takes , *cuando the users of the roads *férreas pay the 56 % and the of the navigable roads the 18 % of the respective costs.
#If well it is true that the crisis of the *EEB has allowed to modify the procedures of taking of decisions in the breast of the Commission, wish to signal, in name of my Group, that these procedures, further of the file of the «crazy cow», have to expand to end to manage of the best possible way the principle of prevention and to avert that they exert  political or economic pressures on the scientific committees and through the experts of the Commission.
We want to give the thanks to the Mr. *Fayot by his work in the Commission in general, and the fact that this Commission do not go to exist more in this form, do not has to involve now -and #this is a last point in the that coincide with our colleague, the Mr. *Corbett- a negative trial of the work of the Commission and, less still, of the work of his president, but that treats  properly that in the future want to have grouped the questions that are important from the point of sight of his content.
Lady Speaker, wanted colleagues, the interest of the Report *Fourçans do not resides only in the fact that it subscribes totally the recommendations of the Commission, but that also involves  clearly in the political debate that so much has agitated the #european environments, included this Parliament, is to say: now that already it has created  the euro, it #would be necessary to soften the budgetary and monetary discipline that has allowed the historical decision of May of 1998, with the end of *relanzar an economic activity rather *titubeante?
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0255/99) of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens, on the consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam (relation of legislative proposals slopes in the Council to 1 May 1999, with indication of the new juridical foundation, #as well as a possible modification of the legislative procedure after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam) (*C4-0134/99 + *SEC(99)0581 - *C4-0219/99).
In effect, the main amendments presented pursue substantially the following goals: insist in the favourable effects that the measure has in the employment of hand of drama no qualified or little qualified and in the environment, #as well as in the reduction of the illegal work; foresee that the Council #can take decisions by qualified majority regarding the permission to apply the type reduced and foresee that the Commission elaborate a report of assessment global accompanied, in his case, of appropriate proposals.
Gentleman Minister, *me direct to *usted with the look put in the Summit of Colony, and *le say that have in his hands a historical opportunity to create in Colony the conditions and the budgets to achieve that the new Conference *Intergubernamental suppose for the external politics it that *Maastricht and *Amsterdam supposed for the economy. A #european external politics that -*usted better that nobody knows *algo of his history- #can not exhaust in the diplomatic activity, but that it has to include answers to challenges like the that constitute the economy, the environment and the culture.
But here I find #one some allusion *anodina, #if no dangerous, with regard to the minors of age, because the minors of age, logically, have the protection of the civil Right, no only in this point of the contracting based in the honesty or in the fine faith, but also regarding that it will be invalid #all agreement *cuando, according to the civil Right, the minors have not reached the necessary age according to the class of sakes and of agreements that it treat .
*Yo #Can not forget #some of the environmental emergencies of my country and also in the rest of *Europa.And)we Highlight the necessary effort in the national levels, *suprarregionales, regional and venues in matter of prevention, cooperation and exchange of experiences.*f)And propose to detect and study the causes of the catastrophes and publish the conclusions of this study so that they are useful for the prevention.We ratify the position of the *PE regarding the necessary committee for the execution of the program, that has to have consultative character, approving the amendment of the Commission of Budgets that proposes that it was more transparent and participatory.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To4-0220/99) of the Mrs. #Miranda of *Lage, in name of the Commission of Relations Economic External, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement of collaboration economic, political coordination and commercial cooperation among the European Community and his States members, by a part, and the States Joined Mexicans, by another (*COM(97)527-11618/97 + 11620/97 + *COR 1 - *C4-0023/98-97/0289/(*AVC)).
To this *respecto wanted to underline that the minister *Schily took part here in the Plenary the day 14 January and that talked in front of the Commission of Freedoms Public and of Inner Subjects on 19 January and on 30 March. *Yo Appeared in front of the Commission of Freedoms Public and of Inner Subjects on 23 November and the Mr. *Eisel, the director of the together competent service *conmigo, was two times in the commission the past week so as to *facilitarles information.
To said end, is necessary to intensify to #all the levels the cooperation with the regional and local authorities and with the socioeconomic operators, nearer to the realities *cambiantes of the regions. It is necessary, without embargo, take into account the disequilibriums caused by the differences of competitiveness among the regions, owed to the distinct levels of employment, of quality of the infrastructures, of the natural environment and of development, especially in this so delicate stage that opens  with the determination of the regions admitted in the Goal 2.
Have the communication to the press of the Fiscal Ministry of the Court of Security of the State in *Ankara, signed by the fiscal lawyer, Mr. *Tzerdet *Volkan; said communication excludes the participation in the trial of «observers of any institution or organisation» and foresees the participation of simple citizens, as long as they have a permission of a special office of the Court, that will not be valid for #all the days of the trial, and will take in consideration, only, the capacity of the hall.
Nevertheless, *nosotros had presented in first reading #some amendments to limit the charge that weighs on the companies, to suppress the no pertinent variables -for example, the modality of transport- and the variables *facultativas, to limit the number of #SME forced to facilitate statistical variables detailed and, also, to simplify the utilisation of the nomenclature combined, without separating  of an only nomenclature regarding the exchanges *intracomunitarios and the exchanges with the third countries.
It wanted to besides appreciate to the President of the European Parliament, the Mr. #Gil-Oaks, for having received very seriously my initiatives to finish with the criminality in and around the #european institutions; also to the president of group *Martens, that has promised not forgetting in *Bélgica this subject for a future and follow *apoyándonos; and, of course, also to the representative of the Council, that promised to put also to *ello, and, finally, to the *cuestores and to the Conference of Presidents, #where this subject is now a subject of actuality.
Lady Speaker of the Council, as #others have said before that *yo, his Presidency produces  in a very particular moment, *cuando the crisis has burst in *Kosovo and the European Union has contributed his contribution to go out of *ella, after an institutional crisis of the that still have not gone out, after the training of a new Parliament in conditions very particular, in the that the constituents  *desinteresan increasingly of an institution that every time has more powers and, finally, after the European Council of Colony, that launched important works for the future.
The elect deputies of the List *Bonino have treated to explain in an open letter to #all his *Señorías the reasons of this constitution, the reasons of the discriminations that they are object the No inscribed deputies in this Parliament and, in consequence, the reasons of our initiative, #as well as of #another that expect that it announce  what before, #this is, the proposal of modification of the Regulation, and especially *les has invited to vote with *nosotros against of this interpretation.
*Le Appreciate the interest and urge to the Commission to that it comprise with clarity that the question of *Timor goes to follow, by misfortune, slope during *algún time and demands urgency in the double humanitarian sense and in the political sense and of security, in the measure in that the announcement of the intervention of an international strength do not guarantees by himself/hisself alone the conditions of security in the territory, because it will have to take part without condition of any class imposed by the #indonesian authorities and the urgency of the humanitarian support is URGENCY in own sense.
I do not have of sufficient time to develop the subject, but wanted to call the attention of the Commission on the need, no only of preventive actions, but also to hold responsible to #all the official controllers, to #all the experts, with the end that the principle of caution do not convert  in a principle of irresponsibility for #that that have the duty to watch by the alimentary security and the health of the consumers.
Regarding the possibility for the countries in roads of development to access to the technicians of the commercial liberalisation, to the *OMC and to his groups of experts, #etcetera, is truth, as it has said , that #this poses a problem: said goal is not, for the moment, near at hand of #many of *ellos, and the utilisation of these complex mechanisms is reserved for those countries that have of means, of here our proposal of a technical assistance (mentioned in the document of the Commission) so that these countries #can by himself/hisself same possess and use the necessary juridical technology.
The Council recognises, the same that the European Parliament, in the first place, that the politics of equality of opportunities for men and women follows being very important; second, that the program of action constitutes the community instrument more valuable for the fulfillment of the obligations contracted in the program of action of the Conference of *Pekín and, finally, that the best way to achieve a realisation with hit is integrating the perspective of equality of opportunities for men and women in #all class of politics.
In front of the flagrant *incumplimiento of it had in said Regulation, the delays incurred in the communications of the lists, the increase of number of ships that use #that *artes, the damages to the *pesquería of the tuna and to the marine ecosystem, the grave economic damages to the fishermen of the *Cantábrico Northwest and the total fault of answer of the EU to the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna (*ICCAT) against the overexploitation of this species:
With #everything, although we consider the proposal of resolution common too much bent to the hypothesis of the aerial missile more that to the of an artefact planted in the interior and, especially, although we consider the own proposal too much indulgent and diplomatic with the #italian political authorities, share the need to ask at last the cooperation of #all the States members of the European Union so that they facilitate it that went *menester for a timely and suitable deepening of the investigations, so as to that #can discover  the *ejecutores, the *inductores and the reasons of this absurd slaughtering.
Gentleman President, in my own name and in the of other members of the Parliament, although respecting fully the solemn character of the session of today, wanted to signal a question of order relative to the article 19 of the Regulation, based in the worry by the human rights, since the visit of today of the President of *Colombia limits  to his address in front of the Parliament until the official dinner with the bosses of the political groups.
*Tampere Has shown that the Union has the political intention to trace common politics in questions that are intimately tied to the daily life, as it is to reinforce the feeling of security of the citizens by means of the fight against the crime organised, especially in the drugs, in the wash of money and in the traffic of human beings, with the judicial cooperation and the mutual recognition of the decisions.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0029/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position (6884/171999 - *C5-0029/1999 - 1998/0163(*COD)) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the velocimeters of the vehicles of engine of two or three tyres and by the that amends  the Directive 92/61/*CEE of the relative Council to the reception of the vehicles of engine of two or three tyres (Speaker: Mr. *Ferri)
It Is necessary to highlight likewise the need that the Union subject his interventions in this matter to a more rigid control and establish systems of review so much of the implication and of the information to the #sindical representatives of the workers, as of the effective goodness no only economic, but also social of said interventions, had account that no always the helps of the Union to the companies have had like answer the stable development of the activities of #the same and the *salvaguardia of his taxes of employment.
*Yo Believe that it pertinent, taking into account, besides, that the report of the Court of Accounts produces a series of consequences on the own parliamentary activity -and think particularly in the approval of the management-, it that we have to take, is *plantearle to the President of the Court of Accounts it that has occurred, reach that it engage  publicly, apart from presenting excuses #if *ello was pertinent, to an investigation to be able to control this subject, that improve  the system of distribution and information to the Parliament, but, in any case, understand that, at the end, it that go to take is *sancionarnos to *nosotros same through this behaviour.
Therefore, it is our duty, in this end of century, *preguntarnos on these millions of boys that are subjected to the prostitution, that  *suicidan, that drug  and, in moments in that our continent hardly #if it begins to discover the *estragos of the *pedofilia, in front of the that during *muchísimo time have closed the eyes, owe *preguntarnos #which is the cause that, in our democratic countries and economically developed, that #all the years celebrate with pride a new anniversary of the Statement of the the Rights of the Man, these same rights see  *pisoteados until this point *cuando refer  to the feeblest, is to say, to our boys.
In addition to the three points mentioned of the Statements of Colony, have arisen in different fields, among other questions, the Court of Justice of the *CE, the Court of Accounts, the distribution of the seats of the Parliament, the flexibility and the division in two parts of the Treaty of creation of the *CEE. In our report will present, in base the conversations kept and to the points of sight received, our own visions on it that consider that it is possible and recommended.
To #that *respecto, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, *permítaseme present an example: #if in the Council there was a modification in the weighting of the votes, in the that, in fact, the countries with more population and the greater countries had more can, and the enlargement of the qualified majority to the process of *codecisión took that this tendency stressed  also in the European Parliament, ask: #which will be the paper in this *Europa of the small countries or of the poor countries of the European Union?
. (IN) In the weeks that have preceded to the agreement on this resolution, #a lot of deputies of the European Parliament have procured to achieve that the attitude of the Union *propicie really a "Round of the Development" in the *OMC, that the countries in development have the possibility to be associated of right plenary in the process of negotiation, and stand out that the benefits of the trade have to centre in the fight against the *agravación of the poverty in our world.
With the argument of the enlargement -#whose materialisation no *nos poses problems of principle, but no *nos seems that it #can carry out without measuring the consequences, in diverse levels- and in name of the efficiency and the democracy, pretends  a modification of the Treaties in particular in the institutional sphere: abandonment of the unanimity and enlargement to new spheres of the decisions by qualified majority, new weighting of the votes in the decisions of the Council by qualified majority and modification of the composition and of the operation of the institutions (number of Commissioners, Presidency of the Council, composition of the *PE or even consecration of the tongues of work...)
The industry, the States Members and the Commission have to collect #all the necessary information to prepare and present a complaint on the regulation of the commercial tariffs and evaluate the suitability to resort to the action of the *OMC, the Commission has to continue his efforts of supervision of the market in cooperation with the industry and, finally, #all the parts involved have to encourage for establishing a field of action for the sector.
By this reason, *yo believe that the Conference *Intergubernamental occupies a central place inside the triangle formed by the enlargement, the Conference *Intergubernamental and the external politics and of security. In this context, also has to remain absolutely clear that in any moment, already was with 12 or with 13 candidates to the adhesion, #can admit  any deviation of the criteria of *Copenhague, and this Assembly do not goes to allow that it produce  and do not goes to ratify any treaty in this sense.
Especially, also it has reached  an agreement -the Parliament also conceded #a lot of importance to this look, *justificadamente to my seem- that it answers to #one *constatación political important, to know, that the tasks of the European Union in *Kosovo and in the region of the *Balcanes are tasks of varied years and that his fulfillment in the financial look #can require an increase of the costs in the field of the external politics regarding the planned at the beginning of this year, on the base of a distinct political situation.
In the first place, the European Parliament; of course, the no governmental organisations, and in this point, and since it has posed  the question, want to say that the movement of the woman and the no governmental organisations have exerted and exert a paper *excepcionalmente important and have been really the strengths *motrices of the politics that have gone  configuring in the #european field; and, of course, they will take part also the Commission, with #many of his services, the states members, and the Presidency.
Challenge to the #scottish minister of Agriculture to that it evade *Londres and support the request of the Scottish Nationalist Party, that delivered yesterday to the #french Government, in the sense that the #french authorities study thoroughly and with character of urgency the scientific proofs, the capacity to determine his origin and the situation of the labeling in *Escocia; and I take a call to #all the #french colleagues of this Assembly so that they defend this line in front of his Government.
An important part of the process of enlargement of the European Union are the different programs of existent cooperation among the Union and the aspiring countries to the adhesion, and the point of game is precisely the improvement of the economy of these countries of face to create possibilities of employment in his own territories, so that his inhabitants do not see  forced to emigrate by economic reasons.
Like solution offers  the #french rule, the *cual, as I complement of the national diet of fixed price, contains likewise relative disposals to the import, export and *reimportación, is compatible with the Right of the European Union and has shown his efficiency in the practice. Thus, gentleman Commissioner, the European Parliament, above his division in political Groups, as it will be able to check easily, expects the green light for a rule of character legal or contractual in *Alemania and *Austria to put good end once and for all to this interminable history.
I believe that #if there #be a reasonable solution from a point of sight economic, with the that the publishers agree; #if there #be a solution that takes into account the diverse linguistic fields and cultural; #if there #be a solution that neither comport the greatest restriction of the competition in application of the prohibition of *sopesar contained in the article 85, then are in the correct path to give with a suitable rule.
It is the question of #if the Commission engages  to fulfil with the promise of the services for the politics in matter of competition of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, in the sense that before it accept  definitively the general diet of exemption by category and before they fix  definitively the orientations, the present Commission his proposals to the Parliament and that still have the opportunity to elaborate a report on *ellas.
(OF ) Gentleman President, as I no longer am the youngest of the 626 deputies, as *me occurred in October of 1965 *cuando was member for the first time of this Parliament, is natural that the report on the new perspectives of life of the persons of age in the century *XXI *me interest especially, also in quality of representative of a national organisation and a big #european organisation of women #where, by true, the most ancient members are the most active, without #whose work from his charges *honoríficos these organisations -like #a lot of #others also- #can not *subsistir, because the youngsters are so overloaded of familiar and labour obligations that hardly are for activities *honoríficas.
The speakers, with #all the reason, have not forgotten the cultural looks, especially in the section 28, in the that it insists  in the need to promote the image of the greater persons in our society and, in this sense, have to say that rather we have retreated regarding the ancient societies, especially the #Grecia classical, to the that we have to it essential of our civilisation and that, with reason, valued the cumulus of experience and wisdom that represented the elderly. To this *respecto, *nos confront to an authentic ideology of *desvalorización of the past.
The immunity, therefore, is a question of order public and in the case that *me occupies, the of the Mr. *Moniz, the Mr. *Moniz in a moment determined asked that  *le raised the parliamentary immunity, *algo that has been taken into account in the resolution of the Commission of Regulation, that by unanimity voted the suspension of the immunity, but no by reason of the will of the Mr. *Moniz to appear in front of the Administration of Justice, but because they fulfilled  the requirements.
Fortunately, the president of the #ECB *Duisenberg put of self-evident the Monday of the past week in the last session of the Parliament that the descent of the types of interest of 8 April was precisely an attempt to contribute *algo to the economic reflation of the Union, said of another mood, has recognised *textualmente that the monetary politics also has an economic function.
#If they do not modify  the relations that there #be in this moment among the countries and the regions of greater economic development and those countries and regions in the that this economic development is lower, #can *encontrarnos with #one *Europa economic and social of two speeds, because the countries and the regions that have a greater economic development, like the Professor *Prodi knows very well, have a tendency to consolidate his economic evolution and, instead, #that #others that are in a situation of worse economic development #can perpetuate  in a situation of inferiority.
The main disposals of this directive include it following: the consumer will have of a period of 14 days before celebrating an agreement that *le will give time to compare diverse proposals and study the agreement in detail before giving his final agreement; the consumer will have of a period of 14 days of right of retractation, 30 days for the credits *hipotecarios, the insurances of life and the operations of retirement individual to renounce to the agreement without penalties neither obligation of justification.
In the measure in that it #can consider  the possibility to hire to the current collaborators of the secretariat of *Schengen in the institutions of the EU, the disposals of the article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen do not prevent of mood #any that the Council hire to the possible interested applying the norms established in the Statute of the civil servants or resorting to the procedure of contracting alternative foreseen in the article 24 of the «Treaty of fusion».
Subject: Support to a new program *LEADER *III #Can *esbozar the Council his current plans with regard to the development of a rural politics fully integrated to scale of the EU, and #can guarantee that a part of this political will be a support continued to the new program *LEADER *III and the maintenance of his denomination, that has been synonymous of endowment of the instruments of management and help and of a positive image for the European Union?
It wanted to warn to the Council that, in spite of the progresses that has carried out in matter of transparency, #if the group of work continues showing so *restrictivo in front of the right of intervention by part of the Parliament, there will be agreement and will follow, legislative procedure after legislative procedure, blocking the measures of *comitología and *oponiéndonos to the approval of measures *restrictivas of this type, at the same time that will follow *mostrándonos very *restrictivos in the votes on the budgets and the credits that will take possible in the future the meetings of the committees of character *comitológico.
To the hour to confront this challenge, without embargo, *nos find in front of a paradox: the European Union will be in first line to the hour to offer his contribution; nevertheless, the impact of his help #can dispel in a complex network of structures that compete among himself/hisself: the Mission of the Nations Joined for *Kosovo, the Pact of Stability, the Group of the Seven of big importance for the economic coordination, the Office of the High Representative for *Bosnia, the Sent Special for the Republic of *Yugoslavia, #etcetera.
It is a confidence *mermada: *mermada as it shows it the fact that it is increasingly under the number of the that choose to the European Parliament; and *mermada, to our understand, no only by the events that caused the resignation of the previous Commission, but also, and *yo #would say especially, by the fact that the #european citizens often see in the Commission the source of *imposiciones bureaucratic, sometimes costly, sometimes no indispensable and neither urgent, sometimes obtuse and even hurtful, *imposiciones that at all have to see with the process of construction of a *Europa joined and that, by misfortune, in #a lot of occasions prejudice the ideal Europeans.
More even, although the poured direct of industrial materials, included the military deposit of residual ammunitions, is a practice that has been amply abandoned by the States members, the locations of these poured follow constituting a real threat for the resources *pesqueros and, in #some occasions, for example, no very far of my own coast, *Beaufort *Dyke, a threat for the human security and, often, the lives of the fishermen are in danger, to the equal that are it the health and the welfare of the persons that visit the coast or well live there.
Finally, I believe that it has got the moment that they adopt  the proposals to the *respecto presented by #Grecia, among the that include  the materialisation of the "fast access of the citizen to the justice" by means of the resource to alternative procedures, like the mediation and the action *conciliatoria before the trial, #as well as the creation of a system harmonised of public order and of resolution of differences, based in the principles of freedom and democracy, and in the respect of the fundamental freedoms and the state of right.
The answer of the Commissioner *Nielson went of it more wanders, and *me surprises to check that today the European Parliament have been able to give green light to the signature of this agreement of *librecambio, *cuando even the principle of the protection of the denominations of origin is not clearly recognised in the annex of the agreement neither establishes  guarantee #any regarding the evolution of the imports of type #zero and to his consequences on the group of the sector *vitivinícola #european.
Postpone the approval of this agreement *interinstitucional or, it that it #would be still worse, not to approve it, and, therefore not being able to apply it in our internal field, #would plant in a very embarrassing situation to the European Parliament, a situation that #would lessen the fine work that this Parliament has made with regard to reestablishing the credibility of the European Union in the questions referents to the fraud and to the bad financial management.
Regarding the #others lines of the relative budget to the external actions of the category 4 of the financial perspectives, a reduction of the fixed amount of the assignments attributed goes to avert, to his time, that adopt  decisions precipitated on the rectification of the maximum limits of this category, because, as I already have said, the evaluation of the real needs of the reconstruction has not concluded still.
Without damage of the positive results that to a large extent finishes to underline the President in exercise of the Council, #can not leave to recognise that in #some points the Commission expresses some disappointment. The Commission regrets that the European Council did not adopt the concept of system only of asylum, that corresponds, to our understand, to an ambition, but also to the need *imperiosa to tackle the questions of asylum of collective and coherent form.

I want to, without embargo, call the attention on the fact that it #would be timely that #all the costs, #all the men, #all the means employed in the past to watch the internal borders of the European Union - for example, among #Italia and *Francia, *Francia and *Alemania, #etcetera, or was, among the #european States that now have a common border - employed  in the external borders of the European Union, so as to combat better this phenomenon of delinquency and of illegal immigration.
Therefore, my invitation goes directed to #all #that that believe in #this dip, in these goals - and here have in front of *nosotros to the President *Prodi that has declared it in reiterated occasions and that know that it believes in *ello - an invitation to be decided, determined; an invitation to the European Parliament so that, immediately after finalising the Summit of *Helsinki - #if, as I fear, the conclusion will be an advance, but too much limited - gather  and with big opening, with big value assume #all his determinations saying in this moment and thinking, as in other moments of the #european history, that the Parliament has in front of himself/hisself a big opportunity and a big task.
The first has reached  with the inclusion of the products of the aquaculture and the *marisqueo, for the that it was not foreseen any help to the commercialisation, *cuando #both are *subsectores that they have to remain, to the equal that the fishing, fully included in a system #whose goal is to adapt the offer to the demand and *cuando, as in the case of the aquaculture, are sectors in roads of growth that have to have a fine planning of the production already from the beginning to avert, in it possible, crisis like the that periodically suffer, for example, the producers of salmon.
Even the *anunciadísima total suppression of the rights of customs in the products of the no developed countries goes to accelerate the *usurpación of the wealth of these countries, whereas, on the other hand, will flood the market with cheap articles that will displace the corresponding articles of countries like the #mine. The World-wide Organisation of Trade has not created  to protect the interests, neither the of the villages neither the of the workers.
The Commission will go by the road that the Parliament recommended already takes time, that the Mr. *Karlsson finishes also to show and that *yo same signalled also in August in my answers by writing to the parliamentary questions, in concrete, the trip to the administration of those functions of control financial that they are competent for the programs of the cost, is to say, decentralisation and with *ello, to #the same time, increase of the financial responsibility in the administrative services that make the costs.
Support absolutely this systematic *follow *up and, in consequence, celebrate to a large extent that the Commission in the frame of his package of reform for the financial management have decided to give to this systematic *follw *up a fixed structure so that in the future was possible to take advantage of of real way for the improvement of the financial management the precisions of the Court of Accounts. For this wide project of reforms ask the support of the European Parliament.
Also it wanted to appeal to #that that have the possibility to benefit  of the program #Socrates, that #can take advantage of the possibilities of training, that go to be able to follow forming in the future, so that they contribute to that *Europa grow jointly, so that in the course of his training recognise that we #can not, with our vertiginous rhythm that presents  at present in the development of #all the programs, is to say, that to #all #that that #can not advance so fast *les take of the hand, since the quality, the level and the training also demand that we do not give sideways to the feeblest.
We consider that an important opportunity to examine the concrete contribution of the Union to the creation of new places of work in *Europa the will provide the next summit of *Lisboa in March, that will be the moment and the place to take an evaluation of the three processes that finish to mention -Colony, *Luxemburgo and *Cardiff-, by a part, and, by #another, to formulate the strategy, the synthesis of the politics *macroeconómicas, the innovation *microeconómica business and the imperative of the new society of the information.
This plan proposes likewise measures allocated to different sectors of consumers designed to improve the sensitisation on the consumption of energy, the experience and the practice in fields #such like acquisition of appliances, the consumption of energy in the home, the facilities of buildings, the systems of heating and the management of the energy in the industry, the sector of the services and also the public sector.
Gentleman President, on a question of order: although tonight no *nos accompanies the representative of the Council, *permítaseme ask #if the Commission or a representative of the secretariat of the Parliament know the reports of an agency of press that have seen, according to the *cuales yesterday adopted  in the Council the decision of *prorrogar the voluntary plan during 12 months, with it that overlooked  the procedure of *codecisión and this debate and the vote of morning result irrelevant.
Gentleman President, the most palpable character, in our opinion, of the European Council that finishes to celebrate  in *Helsinki is the absence of #all political vision on a long-term basis of the bosses of State and of government, that have decided an enlargement of an unpublished importance with the possible addition of thirteen new members, without giving in any moment the conceptual tools that allowed to imagine the able institutional structures of *asumirla.
By #this ask to the Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission and to the Nations Joined that they do not recognise the diet of the Talibans and that promote a plan of action in favour of the no governmental organisations that operate in *Afganistán after the fundamental freedoms of the #afghan women and his economic and social emancipation and in favour of the no governmental organisations that help to the #afghan women refugees.
Gentleman President, as it has announced, substitute to the Mrs. *Aglietta that this afternoon #can not be here, and it first that I want to take before presenting my report on the *comitología, is to express my gratitude to the Mrs. *Adelaide *Aglietta and recognise the seriousness and the importance of his work, a competent work, subtle, acute and effective; a work that, of course, has had the support of #all the secretariat of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, in particular of the Mrs. *Patrizia *Prode, #as well as with the continuous help of the Mrs. #Monica *Frassoni.
But although they #can not  take schematic analyses, *yo #can not *obviar in this context a comment: the Common Agricultural Politics and the World-wide Organisation of the Trade are promoting increasingly the research of a competitiveness exacerbated like fundamental element, thing that *me seems absolutely worrisome because this type of *sacralización of the competitiveness above #everything it other surely conducts to practices of risk, like the utilisation of hormones or antibiotics, for example, among the matters prevail for the animal feeding.
Like immediate measure, the control of the organisations of assistance technical is carrying out of form more rigorous and specific, and the radical reform will ensure the meridian definition of the core of the functions of service public of the civil servants of the Commission and the effective supervision and the responsible management of the executive agencies.
In this frame, have to express the enormous worry that feels my Group in front of the debate that will celebrate  in *Tampere on the police cooperation, the fight against the drugs, the protection of data, the democratic control of *Europol and the System of Information of *Schengen. We fear once again that the participants will not give the size in these important points that have a deep impact on the democracy in *Europa.
It do not treats  only to ensure, in the frame of the globalisation of the economy, an able growth to create durable and sustainable employment, or to propose an institutional reform in depth of face to the next Conference *Intergubernamental; neither it treats  only to carry forward the subject of the enlargement of the Union to contribute, like this, to the welfare of the *Europa global, in spite of the importance *innegable of these challenges.
The European Council in Colony examined the capacity of *Europa to carry out the functions established in the article 17 of the Treaty of the Union, calls of *Petersberg, functions related with the humanitarian help and with the measures of rescue and pacification, #as well as with the definition of the mission of the groups of fight in the control of the crises, included the pacification, a time that *Europa have solvent military means.
Among #others, the suffering and the death of members productive of his societies and -thing very important- the *apartamiento of the women of the employment to devote  to loan cares and the deviation of resources of the families and the communities to devote the savings to pay the costs of attention of health and, in fact, as it has to know, sure, *usted, the incessant burials that see in countries like *Zimbabwe, #if *te remain stopped in the corner of a street.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner *Lamy, gentleman Minister *Sasi, the Round of the #Millenium will have to promote necessarily forms of cooperation and integration among the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the International Organisation of the Work, the International Monetary Bottom and the World-wide Bank, so as to that the liberalisation of the commercial exchanges go accompanied of a renewed stability of the monetary market, of politics of full employment of the human resources, of networks of social protection and of the respect generalised of the fundamental labour norms.
Lady Speaker, have written  #a lot of beautiful words after the celebrated summit in *Tampere; nevertheless, the fundamental premise so that these beautiful words convert  in reality, is to say, so that they fulfil  the principles humanists, is of course that the persons #can go in in Strong *Europa, that begin of serious form to put in practice a politics in the that it was possible to separate the politics of asylum of the immigration, that begin  to put in practice a serious politics of collaboration with the *ACNUR to end to solve the problems of the refugees of *Europa and of the world.
On the question of the fundamental rights, the creation of the frame that allow to this Parliament take his contribution to the preparation of a letter is an element, but go to celebrate debates on the bottom, as, for *nosotros, this letter has to have direct effects, is to say, that the citizens have to can *invocarla to appeal to the Court of Justice and this letter has to *versar on new rights for the Europeans of the century *XXI.
I expect then, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, that the European Commission obtain a mandate of his institution regarding the development of these rights of the citizens of third countries, and that #this develop  in the widest sense, according to the respect of the principle of no discrimination, also *cuando treat  of the right of vote, the right to live in family and the right to the free circulation of persons, even *cuando the Summit has not manifested  on *ello.
(*IT) The fact that the Commission have exhausted the last term to ask the fixation of a date for the negotiation is, definitely, regrettable, especially to the sight of the global course of #all the question that already in the previous years saw to arise a conflict in the institutional frame of the query with reference to the paper of the Parliament in an agreement that has important budgetary repercussions.
In particular, the fault of consensus on the content of the politics *macroeconómicas in the previous period to the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Maastricht and of the first orientations of economic politics played a fundamental paper in the amplification of the negative effects, of the external crashes and in the development of obstacles greater to the growth and to the employment.
But today, remembering *algo that said here in the last Plenary -with *Tampere launches  the signal to the #european citizens that *Europa has left to be only a market-, to me *me #would enjoy to say #alto and clear that, with this strategic document on the inner market that  *nos has presented to the Parliament and that it is today object of this intervention, the citizen goes to have a clear idea of the coherence of this market and that this market has like last and main protagonist *él same.
The participation of the European Parliament *nos seems fundamental, no only because in the #european construction the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission constitute the three points of the triangle that have to conform a construction balanced, but also because the popular representatives gathered in this Parliament are the most indicated to transmit the opinion of the citizens that, after all, is it that matters, so that the Commission #can take out the timely conclusions.
In #one misses  an approach *macroeconómico, in #another is missing the realisation of reforms structural, in the third, there #be not an adjust among the economic politics and the politics of employment. It is evident that have increased the preventive measures as, for example, the insertion of the unemployed of long length in the market of work, or active measures as, for example, stimuluses to the research of work and to the creation of places of work.
It goes the Commission to adopt in this time of negotiations, in the possible decisions of commitment, the necessary measures so that it apply  it that *usted has announced during the audiences in his nomination, is to say, the test and the labeling for the meat of *vacuno, that by it other goes to be compulsory already from the 1-1-2000, #if we do not get to another regulation in relation with the suspension of this prohibition of import and his *imposición in front of the countries that have agreed the prohibitions of import?
Subject: Law *HelmsBurton Has had knowledge the Commission of the demonstrations taken by the Secretary of State of the States Joined, Mrs. *Albright, relative to the impossibility by part of the Congress of the #EE.UU. To modify the title *IV of the Law *Helms-*Burton, breaking like this #one of the essential elements of the Agreement among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the new frame of the Transatlantic Summit among #EE.UU. And the European Union of May of 1998?
Gentleman President, ask the word to remember once again that, from the principle of the term of office, the radical deputies do not take part in the votes neither the Plenary neither in the commissions. And #this to call the attention of the Presidency and of his *Señorías on the fact that to a part of the deputies  *le denies the possibility to contribute with #the same rights and #the same means, to the parliamentary life.
Subject: Restrictions to the freedom of navigation imposed by *Turquía On 27 May 1997, the #turkish authorities adopted a Decision registered with the number 2646 and signed by the Secretary of State of Maritime Subjects, Mr. *Nazmi *Kumral, in virtue of the *cual forbids  the access to *Turquía of #all those fuselages *mercantes with #cypriot pavilion or that belong to *armadores Cypriots or of other nationalities, included the of the States members of the European Union, *cuando his place of origin or of destination was *algún port of the free zone of the Republic of *Chipre.
This discussion that have had in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional relative to the road so that any possible illegal activity was put in knowledge of the *OLAF, believe that *nos has carried to find the suitable road, because a political organ has to have a filter that examine #if sure enough these informations are or no founded and #if they attack or no against the immunity or the inviolability of word that have the deputies.
Of this way will be able to have of financial assistance with charge to the community budget for the reception, the integration and the voluntary return of the refugees, the persons displaced and the applicants of asylum and will have an important instrument that gives a human dimension to the politics of asylum of the Union, as #one of the deputies finishes to ask takes some moments.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, had wished that the debate and the vote of this report had not taken place necessarily today, because *nosotros -and #this want to say it to the principle of my intervention -, because of the circumstances that *nos have forced to modify the agenda, and because of the fact that the hour of votes has extended  so much owing to the long length of the reports *Napolitano, *Leinen, *Dimitrakopoulos and *Schwaiger that the report of the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou will vote it tomorrow early.
In accordance with the philosophy that inspires the new diet of the regions *ultraperiféricas -that besides has confirmed the European Council of Colony asking to the Commission that before 31 December present measures for the regions *ultraperiféricas- in this moment the incorporation of these regions to the European Union do not happens necessarily by a harmonisation *arancelaria and fiscal, but that allows a treatment differentiated, for example the maintenance of the *octroi of *mer in the #french departments of *Ultramar and the of special diets in *Azores and *Madeira.
Another question that have to consider *cuando talk of the construction of ships new is the problem of the waste and the means to treat the waste, and no only *me refer to the waste that derive  of the operation of the ships but also to the rubbish produced during the trip, because the pollution of the sea is an important fed up question and the ships are in very fine responsible measure of *ella.
I coincide fully in his assessment that it is absolutely necessary to reaffirm the international presence of the European Union in the international scene, especially in the looks of security and defence, for the that the #finnish Presidency -and it is necessary to say it with legitimate pride- has given a decisive impulse with this historical meeting of ministers of External Subjects and of ministers of Defence, that is the first time that produces  in the history of the European Union.
*Yo Always repeat that *Turquía already #would have advanced more in the approximation to *Europa #if it had adopted before, in the timely moment, other more radical measures in the field of the human rights, of the rights of the minorities, especially regarding the problem *kurdo, and of the democracy in the frame of the relations with #Grecia, and had contributed to the solution of the problem of *Chipre.
With the time, obviously, #any one that request it and fulfil with the requirements will find a place in the political level; without embargo, #if today we do not proceed quickly in this sense and think in expanding bending almost the number of the States members without institutional reforms *meditadas and checked -no longer there #be time to experience- condemn to death to the dream of #one *Europa political able to respect the identities, the cultures and the traditions and to contribute, nevertheless, to create a new model of #european citizen.
Also they have to  value with #a lot of caution the improvements ascertained by the Commission and the Presidency of the Council in the interior of *Turquía, #if have present the ratification of the conviction of death of the Mr. *Ocalan, that the awarded with the Prize *Sajarov *Leyla *Zana continues imprisoned for having claimed his right to the freedom of opinion, the fault of solution to the problem *kurdo and all it that expresses  in said document in relation with the progresses of *Turquía.
- Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for the adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and his States members, by a part, and *Rumanía, by #another, to take into account the adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of the Realm of *Suecia to the European Union (9730/1999 - *C5-0195/1999 - 1997/0277(*AVC)) (Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence)
Support that the taxes of the heavy transports are taxed in accordance with his real level of pollution and that the destination of these amounts devote  to investments in the railway and to investments in the transport combined among road and railway and, finally, aim the idea to deliver the 91% of the permissions that do not distribute  according to an equal quota among #all the States members attending no only to the needs of the transport in himself/hisself same but also considering the origin and the destination, for example, of the commodities that cross pertinent Swiss of airports or ports like *Hamburgo, *Rotterdam, *Génova or *Marsella.
Gentleman President, the past Monday try, from the Socialist Group, include in the agenda of this Plenary a proposal of resolution that highlighted the 50º anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, put of self-evident the commitment of the European Parliament with the principles of the humanitarian international Right and expressed our support to the International Committee of the #Red Cross.
The Council, after having examined the proposal of the Commission directed to postpone during a year (of 1 January to 31 December 2000) the introduction of a compulsory system of labeling of the meat of bovine and keep during this period the plan of labeling voluntary established in the Regulation (*CE) *nº 820/97, has adopted the following conclusions:
Gentleman President, for me the greater problem that presents the text that go to vote tomorrow -finish to collect it in the distribution- resides in the article 3 of the proposal of the Commission, according to the *cual #would forbid these substances inside the European Union -pray to the Commission that *me listen, because I want to ask an explanation-; as *eso, it that #would vote is that we forbid these substances inside the European Union, but admit that this prohibition do not affect to his manufacture and commercialisation inside the European Union, since the #would send to another Been member with seen to the export to third countries.
The Scientific Committee on the Health and the Animal Welfare approved on 10 March 1999 his report on the looks of the utilisation of *somatotropina bovine relative to the animal welfare and declared that the *BST increases the risk of *mastitis clinical and the length of his treatment, increases the incidence of disorders in the legs, #can affect negatively to the reproduction and induce varied severe reactions in the zone of the injection.
Regretting that the Council have decided to accept to *Turquía like candidate to the adhesion, expect that, at least, do not give  new steps while his Government have not adopted the necessary measures in the field of the human rights, of the international right regarding the delimitation of borders, of the application of the resolutions of the Nations Joined on *Chipre and of a political solution for the question *kurda;
Without embargo, it #would be necessary to abstain of an excess of zeal putting in *entredicho a system that has worked well, especially #if this review of the politics of the competition on the vertical restrictions runs the risk to put in danger #all a sector that, thanks to exclusive agreements of distribution, in particular the agreements of beer, has worked well until the present, giving satisfaction to a time to the *cerveceras, by a part, and, by #another, to the sector of the coffees, hotels and restaurants.
Gentleman President, #would wish to take part about an only question, of a subject of the greater importance for the European Parliament: *usted has engaged  in the exert of his activities like President of the Commission to undertake of way *convincente the reforms that this Parliament expects of the new Commission, by it that *cuando, got the moment, carry out the work of selection together with the Governments of the States members, will have to demand individually to each #one of the future members, #as well as to the group of the Commission, this same commitment of reform.
The participation of *Rusia means first of all that will renounce to exert the blockade in the Council of Security, so that it was possible to adopt a resolution on the base of the Chapter *VII, with an international juridical foundation clear, founded in a decision of the Council of Security like titling of the monopoly of the use of the strength in the frame of the international political system.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0224/99) by the Mrs. *Kuhn, in name of the Delegation of the European Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the conjoint text, approved by the Committee of Conciliation, of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on determined looks of the sale and the guarantees of the sakes of consumption (*C4-0042/99 - *C4-0171/99-96/0161(*COD))
Quote *textualmente: «*Nos pleases the statement of the European Rabbit of *Berlín with regard to the process of peace, in particular regarding the right of the Palestinians to the self-determination without reservations, included the right to create a State, with regard to the *cual the European Union is had to foresee his recognition in his moment, #as well as the commitments assumed by the European Union regarding the future solution to the conflict».
*Manisco And *Marset Fields, in name of the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left - Nordic Green Left; -*B4-0499/99 of the Mr. *Chichester and #others, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European; -*B4-0500/99 of the Gentlemen *Weber and *Hudghton, in name of the Group of Coalition Radical European; -*B4-0505/99 of the Mr. *Voggenhuber and #others, in name of the Group of the Greens in the European Parliament, on the nuclear head office of *Temelin.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *les appreciate very sincerely this debate that has been deep, clear and, in #a lot of cases, exhaustive and that, in his group, has put of self-evident a wide confidence in our future work: a wide confidence because #all the orators, even the that have directed critical to the composition of the Commission, have recognised the need of a big and solid work in common, #as well as the fact that the future of the European Union assent  in the collaboration among the Parliament and the Commission.
Yes, gentleman President, the arms *callan, but the mines *antipersonal continue taking *estragos. The horror of the war has finished, but no the horror of the finding, day after day, of the common pits, tragic and heartbreaking testimony of the contempt of the right to the life of the persons and of the villages that *nos is more that the respect to the diversities, to the identity of a village by #whose affirmation will struggle in this Plenary and struggle in our national Parliaments.
Although obviously I #can not force to my colleague the Mrs. *Loyola of Palace, that in these moments is *felizmente deputy in this Parliament, regarding his politics and his relations with this Assembly, do not is missing the one who considers that it has got the hour that the Commission and the Parliament deepen in his negotiations on the procedures and the conventions of this Assembly that, as it is known, gathers  in more of a place, #as well as on the conventions and the procedures of the School.
To the sight of these circumstances, wanted to *recalcar once again that the problem of the refugees no only has not resolved , but that converts  each day in more dramatic, as I have been able to check in my recent trips to the fields of refugees #palestinian in *Líbano, *Jordania and Syrian, #as well as in the distinct reports of the *OOPS and of the Mr. *Menéndez of the Valley, in his quality of Representative of the humanitarian help of the European Union in *Jordania.
With #everything, want to say simply that congratulate to #all his *Señorías by his interventions, because *algo has emerged with strength: further of the rapidity with that it is necessary to carry out the program, it important is that the European Union and the European Parliament exert a very active paper, very strong so that in Orient Half, and especially among Palestinian and #Israel, establish  a stable and durable peace, so as to find a solution to the problem of the refugees and so that a #palestinian State #can live peacefully with the #israeli State.
They exist two basic principles of the operation of the *OMC: by a part, the discrimination, impassable, among products #whose processes of production are different -*me refer to the environmental conditions or the social conditions in the *cuales elaborates  the product-; on the other hand, the fact that it is necessary to reduce to the minimum the negative effects on the *librecambio of #all relative political measure to the public health, to the protection of the environment or to the social protection.
But the Council, afterwards, opened the box of #Pandora introducing two purportedly technical amendments: #one, to the article 3, in the that establishes a species of legislation delegated, with a continuous reference to the Regulation of the Economic Commission for *Europa of the Nations Joined; and #another, to the article 6, expanding the term of entrance in vigour of the directive because of the need of a time of adaptation of the industry.
The Commission #can accept the spirit, on condition that they introduce  modifications in #some cases to the text of the relative amendments to the complementary measures, the participation of the local communities in the reconstruction, the coordination with organisations no governmental, the query to the Parliament before the Agency extend his activities to other zones of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and, of course, to the budgetary transparency.
(The Parliament approves the legislative resolution)- Report (To5-0037/1999) of the Mrs. *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the juridical subjects and the inner market (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219/1999)
Although the decisions on the possibility by part of *Turquía to receive  to the programs in the frame of the current proposals do not allow an immediate effective participation of this country, will allow to the European Union send a positive signal to the #turkish civil society and express once again his will to develop the sectorial cooperation with *Turquía.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0040/1999) of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the common position of the Council [5617/2/1999 - *C5-0037/1999 - 1998/0272(*COD)] with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the information on the consumption of fuel facilitated to the consumer when commercialising vehicles of new tourism (Speaker: Mr. *Sterckx).
*Yo Am absolutely convinced that it was an error -and want to signal it by a time- that the ancient European Commission did not continue, *cuando initiated  the previous legislative period, the work on a right of obligations #european, that already had initiated the Mr. *Lando and his commission, although this Assembly, that the Parliament, already had put to disposal the corresponding resources.
It did not has to be it to scale #european neither, obviously, neither to scale national, because *cuando exists the social dialogue - that in reality consists in the dialogue among the great unions of workers, often of the most traditional sectors of the economy, and the big company - with frequency are dialogues, cooperations, *concertaciones that have like result exclude to the one who today remains to the *margen of the economic systems Europeans, is to say, the unemployed, the immigrants, the convicts to remain  out of the system of the privileged, the that they find  out of the system of work guaranteed.
Gentleman President, in his proposal on the guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000, the Commission splits of a consideration of bottom: the progresses made by the process of employment, after the launching taken in the extraordinary Summit, are considerable; it signals data - a million #eight hundred one thousand places of work created in *Europa - and confirms, therefore, the structure based in four *pilares and the fundamental character of the guidelines.
We do not share the document on the guidelines for the politics of employment, since it inspires  in the ideas and the principles of the economic liberalism; without embargo, the European Parliament proposes #some indications to improve the equality of opportunities among men and women in matter of employment, the constant research of the dialogue among the social speakers and the necessary query and information of the workers by part of the companies.
But I believe that, for a so difficult directive - and the Parliament knows perfectly that it is difficult - have to take into account the reality of each country, the data of the social dialogue and the postures of the social speakers, the distinct nuances, in #all the points that have mentioned previously, and afterwards take a surgical combination, find a very fragile balance to have the greater possible hit.
It do not fits the lower doubt that in this important matter of the right of family, the extensive zone of absence of resultant right of the loss of efficiency of the judicial decisions in front of the borders has affected juridical and morally to thousands of citizens and has prejudiced to the social and psychological stability of the families, in particular his more fragile links that are the women and the boys.
The improvement of the relations among #Grecia and *Turquía, no longer like merit of the earthquakes, but like a fact aside, and the change of attitude that notes  in *Turquía with regard to the juridical and constitutional reform, in relation with the human rights and regarding the posture in front of the *kurdos are #worthy advances of applause, as also they are it the commitments and the recognition of the reality that give off of the letter that the Mr. *Bülent *Ecevit directed to the #german Chancellor, Mr. #Gerhard *Schröder, in May of the present year.
This proposal of resolution constitutes a clear signal to the international community that, in spite of that the #news on *Timor have disappeared of the main #european newspapers or have left to be the first #news of the most important televisions in *Europa, the attention of the international community and of the European Union on this problem has to continue.
There #be not doubt that the seventeen years that *Mumia *Abu-#Jamal finishes to happen rotting in the runners of the death, after a parody of process, are related with the fact that it is #black, with his fight against of the institutional racism, with the freedom of opinion that has practised this journalist, when having the value to report the corruption that reigns in the rows of the police of *Filadelfia.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0050/1999) of the Mr. Newton *Dunn in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects on the initiative of the Federal Republic of *Alemania for the adoption of a decision of the Council (8357/1999 - *C5-0011/1999 - 1999/0804(*SNS)) relative to the improvement of the exchange of information to combat the documents of trip false.
The fact that the #german Government have procured to avert the parliamentary examination posing this question in the field of the *tercer *pilar and the fact that the #finnish Presidency have not come at least to answer to our questions, was in the parliamentary commission, was in session *plenaria, regret to say that it is a stain for the reputation of the Finns, that up to now had an excellent reputation of opening and democracy.
In the time that remains until *Helsinki, is fundamental that analyse also the state of Right, the situation of the human rights, the respect to the minorities, the protection and the recognition of his cultural identity and the support to the measures directed to abolish the capital pity, that is #one of the amendments to the Report *Morillon presented in our commission this week.
The proposal of the Commission do not tackles specifically the problems of the pollution of the air acclimatise in the countries candidates, and had account of the imminent enlargement, consider little responsible that the Parliament do not receive any relative information to the levels of pollution in countries like *Polonia and the Czech Republic, #as well as on the #likely cost and the calendar that will be necessary to achieve that these countries adjust  to the new norms.
Gentleman President, when hailing the Report of the Court of Accounts, so useful, and that this Assembly has to support because like this we support to *Europa, #can not avert *referirme to the unrest that produces the that again they have been #some media the that have advanced partial versions and interested of the report, taken that apart from producing, gentleman *Karlsson, unnecessary damages to citizens, civil servants and institutions, gives the impression of that the Court of Accounts is a political organ that it has to *rendir accounts to the constituents through the public opinion.
And *yo believe that really this Parliament, with an action a bit more audacious of the Commission, a bit more ambitious and also -why not to say it- a bit more engaged with the process of reform of the institutions, #can achieve that the *desencuentros that have produced  in the past transform  in harmony in the future and that we #can #all promote this project of reform of the European Union, knowing, as we know, that, #if they do not take  in consideration and leave  to the *margen the worries of our citizens, these reforms will not be able to  concretise and will not be able to  culminate with hit.
Only to confirm to the Mrs. *Riis-*Jø*rgensen, #whose continuous and deep interest by the relative questions to the state help is very known and appreciated by the Commission, that the investigation goes to continue, that the effective applicability of the relative disposals to the #SME is #one of our worries and that in the analysis of #all the investigations on state help have  very present his effects in the trade among the States members.
Without embargo, also want to manifest with #the same clarity, so that it do not remain place to doubts, that the corresponding statements of the institutions, also on the subject of the review limited of the financial perspectives, that expect to receive of the Commission from the month of April, and the consequent answers of the Council, represent an operation of change, as #if it treated  of an office of change of currencies, for saying it like this. And the one who do not credits the change, loses his credit.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation (To5-0079/1999) of the Mr. *Bodrato, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement on the establishment of regulations technical world-wide applicable to the vehicles of tyres, and to the squads and pieces that #can mount or use in said vehicles ("Parallel Agreement") (10167/1999 - *COM(1999) 27 - *C5-0073/1999 - 1999/0011(*AVC)).
I go to mention #some of the actions assumed by the Commission, to stress that I am convinced that there #be a big field for a still greater activation so much of the Commission as of the states members and that, of course, requires  a specific politics for the treatment of these subjects, so much in the frame of the preparation of the meeting of follow-up of the Conference of *Beijing, as, later, in the frame of the *quinto plan of action for the woman.
On the base of the restructuring of the collaboration among the EU and *Centroamérica in the frame of the Congress of Saint #José in #Florencia in 1996, and of the documents of strategy elaborated in 1999 for the collaboration among the EU and *Nicaragua, have to indicate that, in the collaboration for the development with *Nicaragua in particular, the European Union concentrates  *primordialmente in the strengthening of the State of Right and the promotion of a just social politics.
The fact is that the only person that really knows the finances of the European Union, to know, the Boss of our Court of Accounts, the Mr. *Friedmann, do not takes long was in our group of work Bread-*Europa here in the European Parliament and in his exhibition *nos said that the costs of this enlargement exaggerate  enormously as never they include  the costs of the no enlargement.
Equally it is important that continue in the future the fine cooperation that have come developing among the Commission of Requests and the Defender of the Village, and that #this succeed to his time with the defenders of the national village or with the corresponding institutions to be able to, of this way, combat the rapes of the rights of the citizens that commit  precisely in the community legislative frame.
Gentleman President, when talking today here, fifty-eight days before the elections to the European Parliament, in the last days of the operation of this European Parliament, seat that the conjoint debate on the Commission of Requests and on the Defender of the European Village has a special significance and comes, like a balance of #all a term of office *quinquenal, to give a message in these next elections.
Gentleman President, wanted to present a brief oral amendment that #would involve that the competition regarding the new article 13 against of the discrimination continued *recayendo in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens, but as with this amendment pretends  endow also of competitions to the Commission of Subjects Social and Employment, #would wish to present to this *respecto an oral amendment in the sense that, also by it that *respecta the Commission of Rights of the Woman, #would fit to take a small observation.
Although #some community legislative norms apply  to the users of vehicles deprived -for example the taxes on fuel, the taxes on the consumption, the VAT-our current approach in matter of *tarificación centres  in the commercial traffic, as it treats  of a problem that only #can  resolve with hit through a community statutory frame, that protect the operation of the inner market of transports to #the same time that integrates totally the environmental goals.
In effect, the fusions and the economies of scale in this sector, the tendency to the «*megabancos» and to the agglutinations, the #tending technological developments to improve the productivity, the pressures on the employment or even on the actors of dimensions more regional, have his own logical, the *cual do not coincides necessarily with the general interest or with the goals of employment.
In reality, our Community has employed  in depth in the fight against the violence underlining the value of the right to the life, the security, the freedom and the physical and mental integrity with #all a series of programs like the that today we treat to perfect: the program *DAPHNE that struggles against the violence against the women, the teenagers and the boys.
In the votes of yesterday in the morning, of the proposal of decision on the number and competitions of the parliamentary commissions, the Parliament approved two contradictory amendments regarding the competitions in matter of juridical protection of the consumers, to know, the amendment 31, of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, and the amendment 60, of the Group of the Popular Party European.
Like this as, have two requirements that formulate to #european level: that the calculation of the restitutions to the production take  from the price of the corn to world-wide level, and no from the price of the wheat, because it is in the industry of the corn in the that bases  the industry of the starch; and, second, that procure  likewise -as they have remembered takes a moment our mates *Sonneveld and *Mulder- conserve a true balance among the starch and the starch produced from the cereals.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted colleagues, of the recent conflicts with the States Joined have learnt two things: first, the need to develop the dialogue no only with the Americans but also with other regions of the world because we will need and, in fact, already need new allies, and second the need of a greater surveillance by part of the European Union of the negotiations of the *OMC, having besides in account his increasing importance, all *ello is obviously a collective problem that *atañe also to the #european Parliament.
Like this the things, no *me remains more that *decirles with the maximum clarity that am deeply conscious of this difficult moment and of the big confidence that have, #as well as of the fact that *me are putting to proof *ustedes and more still, #if it fits, the next Parliament, in front of the *cual will have to go back with the squad of the Commission to the complete and, to *través of the squad of the Commission, will have to offer a concrete guarantee of the promises and of the commitments that have assumed in the debate of 13 April and in the debate of today.
We coincide, in wide majority, in the radical conviction of the criminal practices designated of ethnic cleansing, of the that it is guilty *Milosevic, in that we have to show solidarity specifically with the refugees, in the affirmation of the right of these last to return to his country and in the need to guarantee the respect of this right by means of the presence of an international strength in a *Kosovo to the that  *le concede a real autonomy and, finally, in the perspective of a conference on the *Balcanes.
In relation with the #another proposal that the Council has been asking, to know, the audits of our general diets of secretariat, there #be not reason so that on 20 July, #if we do not have an agreement on the statute of the deputies, do not have to say that will carry out an annual audit of the general diets of secretariat that have to present to the Parliament, made by auditors of *bona *vide and that it was precise to present to the Parliament so that the deputies receive his annual diets.
The Commission approved the text of the conjoint statement in his meeting of the past 9 March; the Council took it the past week, and corresponds now to the Parliament give his agreement, with the end that the three Presidents #can confirm the agreement of his institutions to the conjoint statement in a ceremony of signature this week.
Basing in this strategy, the Parliament, in his first reading, integrated in an only regulation so much the proposal of regulation of the relative Council to the structural measures of the sector *pesquero, integrated in the Diary 2000, as equally the proposal of regulation of the Council by the that they defined  the modalities and conditions of the interventions with structural purpose in the sector of the fishing.
Has a stable democracy, and although for both countries has  *prorrogado a year the financial protocol do not exist structures for a stage of *preadhesión, and #if it thinks  in a species of *mini *PHARE, then #would request that the Commission showed prompt to these candidates the perspectives under the *cuales #can begin his stage of *preadhesión, so that they receive #the same security of planning that the other since precisely *nosotros the that come of the States members greater of the European Union also #would owe *sentirnos managers of the small candidates.
I consider that this case confirms also the fine diplomatic utilisation of a recently arisen argument in the international political scene: that the international community #can not use two weights and two measures; that the international community, *cuando demands the respect of the human rights in *Kosovo, has to be consistent with the requirement of his respect in other parts of the world.
Regarding the pity of death and the establishment of a universal moratorium of the capital executions, as *ustedes know, the past 28 April, precisely the European Union took the initiative to present in front of the Commission of Rights Human a project of resolution on the question of the pity of death.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0253/99) of the Mrs. *Gebhardt, for the Delegation of the Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  a mechanism of recognition of titles for the professional activities to that refer  the directives of liberalisation and of transitory measures and completes  the general system of recognition of titles (3612/99 - *C4-0209/99-96/0031(*COD))
Like general indication of the opinion that *sustenta the Commission about the questions that poses the proposal subjected to the Assembly, remit to His *Señorías to the final section of the statement of the Commission of 1 July 1999, in the that manifested the opinion that «it #would be advisable of face the future clear the application of the article 213 regarding the activities of the members of the Commission after having ceased in his charge».
#Such as I have commented previously, have been speaker in a series of questions, and #can take a brief outline of *cuán extensive will be this review and of it that will cover: universal services, frequencies, satellites, regulation, licences, interconnections, numbering, mobile telephones, convergence of the *radiotelevisión, the transmission of data and the telecommunications; which means an explosion of legislation and affects to an enormous segment of the industrial and commercial base of the European Union by own right, but also like helping of #many other industries.
It is true, of course have arisen some gigantic problems in *Bélgica and of course the European Commission, with reason, has said that in the #belgian situation have committed  some grave errors; but the colleagues Deputies, that to these heights know at least *algo of the file, know that the #belgian Government has taken some very drastic measures and that now #can give guarantees to #all the consumers of #all the #european Union.
With regard to the subjects that the President designated has posed on the reform, that the Commissioner *Kinnock will present the next month of February with the owed query, the program of politics of the next month of January, the imperative moral and politician to confront the challenge of the enlargement and the preparation of the Conference *Intergubernamental, promise that my Group will assume a positive and constructive commitment with the Commission in this sense.
As frankly I believe that in the attempt of #some in moving his domestic debates to the community institutions; in #some governments that play with the #european charges to satisfy requirements of pacts in his countries, and also in #some parties in the opposition that want to elevate to other instances it that do not achieve home, like the of the Mr. Baron, in *España, to the one who *le have commanded to prolong the internal electoral debate attacking -and *él knows it- of unfair and disloyal way to the vice-president proposed of the European Commission.
Tomorrow, a group of deputies of diverse political groups will initiate the works to create a *intergrupo that work in this sense, with the intention to create a spirit of cooperation with the Commission and with the Institutions of the Union in the sense that the collective rights and his recognition are a prolongation of the recognition of the individual rights.
Product of the negotiations among governments, his paper is the to contribute to create the most favourable conditions for the multinationals in his permanent efforts for increasing his benefits to coast of his own employees, the most recent example is the of *Michelin, and besides, in damage of the majority of the population of the European Union and of the poorest villages.
Since tomorrow we will not be able to vote in favour of determined Commissioners and place that #can not take state with my individual vote in this Assembly that my colleague Mr. *Patten #would be an excellent Commissioner of External Subjects, simply do not have more option that vote against of this Commission in his group to send the message to the Mr. *Prodi and to his colleagues that #if they go out chosen, will have to answer in front of this Parliament, accept that the things #can not follow as up to now and that we have to change of habits #if we want *infundir to the population of *Europa the confidence that have to have in this Parliament and his institutions.
As they explain the workers of help humanitarian of the international community, the employees of Cross #Red International and of other organisations of rights human were forced to abandon the zone, with the end to be able to commit the crimes without the presence of witnesses foreign.
The Council also has expressed his worry by the fact that, in addition to the #serbian population, other ethnic groups no *albanos have seen  forced to abandon *Kosovo; in this sense, the Council has remembered that in virtue of the resolution 1244 of the Council of Security of the UN, #all the refugees and the displaced have right to return to his zones of origin.
)#Can, then, be acceptable that, after the competent organ of the European Union considered timely to raise the prohibition, determined States, without presenting neither take public a clear justification from the point of sight of the *inocuidad of the foods, keep the relative prohibition to the meat of bovine? This decision, adopted by the #french Government the past week, constitutes another hit particularly last for the *criadores of bovine livestock of *Escocia, #whose herds are fed predominantly with grass and that, first of all, did not have problem of *EEB.
Without embargo, as it has affirmed  here, the subject did not remains resolved with this program, but that the increase of the sustainable use of the sources of energy renewable demands still #a lot of study, pilot projects, the exchange of results in the investigation, the harmonisation of the legislation, the review of the attitudes, campaigns of information #as well as private and public investments, that will amortise  only in the future.
It is a modern agreement that adjusts  to the needs of our times. It loans special attention to the liberalisation of the rates, to the creation of a zone of free trade, to the commitments in the field of the development and of the economic cooperation, to the commitments in the terrain of the science and the technology and to the relative commitments to the political dialogue.
Subject: Measures of the Commission to restrict the transfer of armament and promote the, disarmament Taking into account the *primer annual report that will publish  *próximamente on the #european code of relative behaviour to the transfer of armament for 1998, #can indicate the responsible commissioner for the external relations #if it #would support an enlargement of the competitions of the Commission to include the subjects referents to the trade of arms in the next Conference *Intergubernamental?
In consequence, to my understand, it is necessary to ask to the President of the Commission, to the Council and to #all *nosotros that keep  and respect #all the agreements with the #turkish State, and that keep  besides a punctual action and it more specific possible of the competent organs of the Community, oriented to follow attentively that the process of democratisation and the peaceful solution to the divergences with the other States carry  advance specifically and no only to hit of statements of the #turkish State.
We happen to other three subjects: the protection of the environment, the health of the consumers and the audiovisual sector, that, further of the existent tensions among technical progress and cultural traditions, reflect shots of civilisation that *singularizan to *Europa: the requirement of quality -for example, in the field of the feeding-, the cultural identity in an open world, the preference by it "no *vendible" in some number of activities.
Subject: free Sales of taxes #Can the Council inform of his strategy to help to the airports, ports, aerial lines and companies of maritime transport of *pasajeros of *Irlanda to surpass the loss of income that results of the suppression of the free sales of taxes? How it foresees the Council protect to the consumers against the *encarecimiento of the notes, boost and protect the employment and support the development of infrastructures essential, *cuando all *eso took  before thanks to the free sales of taxes?
I have said "another angular stone" , because from the year happened this Parliament has to observe the most rigorous disposals of the that apply  to almost #all the other #european parliaments by it that refers  to the statement of the financial interests of his deputies and has already in the Regulation #one of the groups of disposals more rigorous that apply  to the behaviour of groups of interest in the frame of the institution.
Gentleman President, with rhythms of development underneath of the 2%, with a new promotion of the interests, with deflation and with a rigorous application of the pact of stability, intensifies  the pressure to the rights of security social and to the social rights of the workers, and the immediate result is the impairment of the conditions of life and of the labour conditions of the workers.
Although it do not fit doubt that the transparency has increased and, for example, the sessions of information after the meetings of the Council of Government have represented a clear improvement in the methods of work, the goal has to be the continuation of the increase of the opening, #as well as that the operation of the Bank consolidate  and was possible to leave backwards the problems of the initial stage.
Regarding the transparency, to the *cual define like the *ofrecimiento to the public or to the Parliament of the maximum possible information on the evolution of the economy, on the monetary evolution, on the result of the deliberations of the Council of Government, create -and like this *me manifested in my introductory intervention-, that the Central Bank European #can watch directly to the eyes of any central bank of the world.
In #a lot of States members - the history of these years *nos remembers it - exist cases of restructuring: the history, as I finish to say, is full of cases of restructurings, *deslocalizaciones, closings of companies - the Mr. *Wurtz has referred  to #some of *ellos - that no only reduce the employment, but that put in danger the economic and social cohesion of the zones affected, create a climate of insecurity social among the workers and a climate that do not favours at all the development and the growth.
Even I believe that have #a lot of interest, in the field of the legislative and institutional interventions, the proposals on the transfer of the taxation, of the territory of the labour cost, of the taxation of the workers, to the territory of the environment. And already there #be a *primer positive breath of the directives on the employment, in this direction.
Regarding the nuclear arms, exist two essential documents. By a part is the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms, in the that the countries with this type of armament have forced  to *desactivar his nuclear arms to change that other countries no the manufacture and, by #another, the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs, that is extraordinarily important since the proofs are to develop the nuclear armament.
Gentleman President, to the time that *subscribo the words of the colleagues that *me have preceded, wanted to express, in name of the Group *Europa of the Nations, the enormous joy that, in a many times motivated world by a hierarchy of interests and no by a hierarchy of values, this Parliament recognise to a valuable man that struggled by a value, the of the freedom of his village, and *le concede the prize *Sajarov.
Nevertheless, in my quality of Austrian, have to manifest, second, that this dialogue among the social speakers, among the political institutions, among the fiscal politics and the political mandators, comes  developing and practising under an analogous form from takes years in my country, *Austria, and has contributed of appreciable way to that *Austria #can present now like a country with a high level of employment and some figures of unemployment inferior to the of other countries.
In a moment in that the economic recovery #would allow at the same time a reduction of the public deficit and a politics of support to the growth, an effective coordination of the budgetary politics centred *prioritariamente in the investments *infraestructurales, the investigation, the education and the training #can have an effect of reflation economic durable.
In these proposals demands  to the States members that force  to reach a balance among men and women in places of direction, to appoint to #the same number of men and women in the committees and groups of work in the EU, to improve the legislation of the labour market so that #this reflect the problems and needs of the women and to form to the persons that design the national guidelines of politics of employment so that they integrate more effectively criteria of equality of opportunities in his work and, finally, to that in the countries members establish  goals *mensurables of annual character.
It do not has felt that we have to negotiate with the European Commission, after #all the events of the last months, a new code of behaviour that, among other things, insist in that, *cuando there are subjects of importance, the Commission has to come to say to this Assembly #which are these subjects first, and afterwards has to initiate a procedure, like the annual report of the Court of Accounts, and say: there #be had a leak, is unpleasant, but follow with the subject as #if #nothing had happened.
Already it has remembered  in other interventions that, takes #some years, the European Parliament had promoted pilot projects in support of the no governmental organisations and of the local authorities that, from takes time, confront  with actions of fight against the violence to the women and the boys: a phenomenon, #this of the violence to the women and the boys, by misfortune, no only very spread, but that goes in increase and that  self-evident under forms increasingly sophisticated and, therefore, more difficult to combat.
Insist in the current logic of the cost, in the that stands out the corresponding to the Common Agricultural Politics, that, in addition to putting in *entredicho any goal of equity recognised like principle in the Treaties, of politics only has the denomination, insist in the system of income in vigour, fruit of diverse and contradictory interests among yes, results *indefectiblemente *inconciliable with the wish of deepening of the project of enlargement of the geographic space.
It suffice to think in the Indian, #whose legislation do not foresees right of copyright on the medicines or the foods, to weigh that in the Indian produce  and of the Indian proceed grasses that serve to the multinationals and to *nosotros for our illnesses; or to the *Sudáfrica of *Mandela that like reprisal to his attempt to convert in more accessible the treatment for the patients of AIDS, has seen  impose by the World-wide Organisation of Trade the withdrawal of the cheapest medicines.
Only it wanted to highlight a look that #can consider  that it constitutes the foundation of our conjoint resolution on *Chechenia: the suffering of the civil population, the hundreds of victims mortal, the 200.000 refugees and the situation in the that find  with the arrival of the winter, the disproportionate reaction of the #russian Government and the bombardment *indiscriminado of the civil population.
To risk that *nos *remuerda the consciousness, #would wish to remember the example of the banana: the multinationals (Of the Mount, *Dole and *Chiquita), that with the support of the States Joined commercialise in the #european market the pertinent bananas of the slavery, produced, besides, in some conditions of security alimentary more that doubtful, have reached *hacernos pin the knee; it treats  of a file in the that #be to capitulate without conditions, leaving that they break hundreds of thousands of producers no only of the countries *ACP, but also the community producers, that are the of #Guadalupe and *Martinica!
The Commission signals repeatedly in his report of situation on the progresses made in the adaptation to the *acervo community that, in numerous looks, the countries candidates, so much the of the group of head like the of the second group, still advance of way very *vacilante in the transposition and adaptation to the *acervo community; for example, in relation with the social subject, but also regarding the subject of the environment and the energy and even in the subject of the human rights and the daily democracy.
In front of an extraordinary event and the unilateral initiatives of peace like the decision of the PKK to abandon the fight armed and suspend the hostilities, in front of the decision of numerous leaders of the PKK to deliver  to the #turkish authorities to reiterate his option to negotiate the peace, the #turkish Government has given negative and pejorative answers.
I want to remember the attentive attitude of our speaker and his *receptividad in front of the demand to the Commission of new complementary information, reason of the delay of the vote in the Plenary of his report until so much the Commission did not satisfy his request referred to the last scientific reports that endorsed the coverage of the geographic area delimited in the #Douglas *Bank *Box and the redesign of the conditions and his extension.
I do not propose to dismiss definitively the candidature of *Turquía to the European Union. But it is necessary, previously, demand to *Turquía firm and definite commitments, and check that they fulfil : the recognition of the rights of the village *kurdo, the abolition of the pity of death and a new trial for *Ocalan, the release of *Leyla *Zana and of #all the political prisoners, the application of the resolutions of the Nations Joined for the solution of the #cypriot problem.
So that it do not give  here a mistaken impression this morning in relation with the process of peace and the international bottom for *Irlanda, want, like deputy to the Parliament by the border counties, take state here -and create to talk in name of the village of *Irlanda- that appreciate fully the important, positive and practical paper that the European Parliament and the #european institutions have exerted in the process of peace and believe that say it contrary do not reflects the opinion of the #irish village.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0086/1999), in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, concerning the common position (14247/1/1999 - *C5-0027/1999 - 1997/0264(*COD)) adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the safe of civil responsibility derived of the circulation of vehicles cars and by the that amend  the Directives 73/239/*CEE and 88/357/*CEE (*Cuarta Managerial on the safe of vehicles cars) (Speaker: Mr. *Rothley)
Report (To5-0101/1999) of the Mr. *Papayannakis, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council that modifies the Regulation of the Council (*CE) *nº 820/97 by the that it establishes  a system of identification and register of the animals of the bovine and relative species to the labeling of the meat of *vacuno and of the products to base of meat of *vacuno (*COM(1999) 487 - *C5-0241/1999 - 1999/0205(*COD))
Although the #turkish Prime minister have declared the next day of the Summit that the belonging to the European Union was for *Turquía, quote: "a right of birth" -it that gives, by it other, an idea of the modesty with the *cual is decided to open the door of the European Union-, is evident for #all the observers that conserve the free mind that his entrance #would change deeply the nature of the Union.
#A lot of States members of the European Union have to answer to #a lot of questions by it that refers  to his own support in the past to the #indonesian authorities *cuando #this *oprimía to the village of *Timor Oriental, and by the fact that these countries and his companies of manufacture of armament have obtained enormous benefits to coast of innocent lives, of the welfare and of the right of the persons to live freely, without being subjected to tightness #any neither to rapes of the human rights.
In summary, it is necessary to say that, in any case, the enlargement of the European Union eastwards will have a positive repercussion in the #european environment, since the adhesion will see  accompanied by an environmental rule more strict in these countries candidates, the economic growth will endow  of a sustainable base and the own countries will be able to fulfil the international agreements in environmental matter.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0136/99) of the Mrs. *Peijs, in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Decision of 19 December 1996 by the that adopts  a program of action for the customs in the Community ( "Customs 2000») (*COM(98)0644 - *C4-0639/98-98/0314(*COD)).
That the military aggression of the NATO was the cause of the dramatic aggravation of the humanitarian situation of the region of the *Balcanes, put in risk the stability of the political future of that region and in grave danger the world-wide peace remains to *obscuras for the political blindness of this majority that before prefers to insist in agreements that never were accepted by the negotiators, are only *imposiciones negotiators of the NATO and put in risk sovereignty, borders and ancestral realities.
I wish to underline the urgency and the need of the intervention of the NATO in the region to protect the fundamental rights of the population of *Kosovo and signal that this tragedy perhaps #would have been able to  avert #if the European Union, in addition to being an economic and monetary institution, had been from takes time also a unitary political reality.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the second inform (To4-0114/99) of the Mr. go *Dam, in name of the Commission of Transports and Tourism, on the proposal of directive of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 96/53/*CE of the Council by the that establish , for determined vehicles of road that circulate in the Community, the maximum dimensions authorised in the national and international traffic and the maximum weights authorised in the international traffic (*COM(98)0414 - *C4-0486/98-98/0227(*SYN))
In *tercer place, *les signal that, apart from the regulate attention that the Council of Ministers loans to the #burmese question, this attention has manifested  also in the suspension of the conference EU-*ASEAN, foreseen for the past month or six weeks ago in *Berlín, since it #can not  reach an agreement regarding the participation of *Birmania and because the special formula offered by the Council so that the question of the human rights in *Birmania #can treat  with the #burmese, was not accepted by the *ASEAN.
Also they will be able to enjoy of fiscal advantages the small and medium enterprises that believe employment in the city without prejudicing the surroundings. These actions complete  with the creation of models of sustainable tourism that #can include a rule that regulate the access to the city in periods of maximum influx and measures of support directed to the local economy that base  in the sustainable use of the natural resources and the historical heritage of the city.
To initiative of the Commissioner *Flynn, the Commission has examined the problem of the future of the social security and have #a lot of taste in saying -recently to instances also of the #german Presidency and of the European Parliament- that very prompt go to present a communication on the bottoms of pensions, in the that will take out the conclusions that give off of the application of the Green Book.
Therefore, the proposal that take, and that know that it is studying the General Direction *I, is the to create a bottom of compensation and to propose to the budgetary Authority include in the budget, precisely for *facilitarles to *ustedes, to our common commercial politics, the means, a bottom, a reservation that #can compensate to the #european companies that they are innocent victims of this just and necessary common commercial politics.
The goal of these proposals is the modernisation of the administration and the politics of personnel, the solution of the problems in the field of the budgetary management, the financial control and the fight against the fraud, #as well as the reform of the financial management by means of a financial control more effective.
But it is likewise contrary, evidently, to the Letter of the Nations Joined, that establishes explicitly that the use of the strength, except in case of legitimate defence, will be reserved to the permissions of the Council of Security, to the that has ignored  with an incredible cynicism in despise of this fundamental law of the international society: it has not requested  the permission of the Council of Security, because it knew  that the Council #would not give it.
Gentleman President, *cuando #one visits *Belgrado #can not leave to feel ire and indignation in front of the show of the destruction and the death caused by the bombardments of the NATO, neither #can leave to feel admiration by the strength and the value of the #serbian village, to feel  *conmovido by the form and the content of the demonstrations of a village that transforms  in alive shield to protect the bridges of *Belgrado.
In the meantime, in the world-wide level and in spite of the manipulation generalised, the public opinion  self-evident and demands the intervention of the Nations Joined and a political solution that allow the return of the refugees and the respect of the current borders, the Americans and the #european Governments subordinated #his talk of terrestrial operations, answer with the called «total war» that all considers it strategic white, rehabilitate and rearm a movement that till lately #all considered terrorist and fundamentalist.
But fortunately, it achieved  this commitment in *Berlín, to the that *sucedieron negotiations among the Council, the Parliament and, of course, the Commission, that brought three positive changes: the *primer change concerned to the community initiative *Urban; the second to the European Bottom of Regional Development, on the actions by the culture and the tourism, and the *tercer change *atañe to the special emphasis that the Regulation of the European Bottom of Regional Development puts in the insular regions.
They are not the financial pot of the that #one #can serve freely *cuando in *algún that another spot needs  money but that they are a half to boost a very concrete goal, to know, the to boost the economic and social cohesion of this Union and stand out in the practice the principle that the solidarity is #one of the essential foundations for the existence of the #european Union.
The Council of «Subjects General» has underlined in his meeting of 26 April 1999 the intention of the European Union to respect fully the last decision of the *OMC in the war of the banana and to modify of the corresponding mood and without delay the diet for the bananas of the EU.
Subject: Contracting of civil servants without the previous celebration of an opposition In his answer to my relative question to the intention to hire to pertinent collaborators of the secretariat of *Schengen, the Council indicates that, of compliance with the article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen *anejo to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, is forced to integrate to the personnel of *Schengen, since this Protocol has to be considered like part of the Treaty and, therefore, like part of the primary community Right.
Gentleman President, my colleague, the Mr. *Hoppenstedt already has explained -and very well- the position of my Group on the report of the Mrs. *Oddy, to the one who *le give the graces; but, in the agitated debate that has developed  on purpose of the electronic trade in *Europa and of the difficult question of the content in line, of his origin, of his destination, of his legality, #can say and underline that in the public networks, like Internet, has to have spot for the freedom of expression.
Gentleman President, *permítame that conclude my intervention with the following words. I expect of #all heart -*usted will be able to check it in person- that the next Parliament continue this debate, that do not sacrifice it in name of the economic subjects or the subjects related with the enlargement, by important that are, but that consider the question of the human rights like a political goal #whose materialisation depends of the politics of the #european Union, and especially of the external politics and the politics in matter of enlargement.
#Can *usted confirm that the Table agreed yesterday send a delegation to see to the Mr. *Rugova and, #if #this is the case, #can *usted call the attention of the political groups on the Article 9.1 of the code of behaviour, Annex 1, Articles 1 and 2, that establishes that before a Deputy #can be appointed *válidamente for the exercise of a mandate, or take part in an official delegation, has to have completed in the form owed the planned statement in the Article 2?
I declare restarted the period of sessions of the European Parliament, interrupted on 7 May 1999, and opened the planned session in the section 3 of the article 10 of the relative Record to the election of the representatives in the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, #as well as in the section 3 of the article 10 of the Regulation of the Parliament.
Of course it is well that in Colony have  *desbrozado the path for the reforms, but *nosotros have an answer for the *interrogantes that has posed *usted here, gentleman President of the Council, in relation with the widest perspective of an enlargement of the European Union and the institutional configuration of our Union, for #this *interrogantes have an answer and this answer is clear: we wish a big reform of the previous institutions to the enlargement.
#All this process of change will require time, but already have set up a first reorganisation of the Commission: it will simplify  and *racionalizará the bureaucratic device reducing the number of Directions General; the Commissioners will have his offices, or was, the cabinets, in #the same building of the General Directions to his charge; the cabinets and the Commissioners will be more agile and more *supranacionales.
*Me States, like speaker of the recent managerial on the filling of earth, that it that is occurring is that the European Commission is proposing norms on the base that they go to be approved and adequately applied in the States members whereas, to #the same time, #the same general direction of the European Union knows perfectly that in #a lot of areas of the politics do not exist able inspections of *averiguar #if these norms are applied in #some States members of the European Union.
And in front of this dangerous panorama no only do not remain indifferent, no only condemn it, and vote against of the new Commission, but that besides call to the workers and to the villages of *Europa to carry advance his fights, to raise a wall against the disastrous plans that  *ciernen on his future, the call to *darle the turn to the current situation, by #one *Europa different, by a *Europa of the villages, of the peace and the solidarity, of the mutually beneficial collaboration.
Thus I believe that our more urgent task consists in fulfilling the previous conditions to the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice. In concrete, have to begin for elaborating a Letter of rights fundamental #european place that do not treats  only to centralise the state and police power, but that also is necessary *europeizar the rights of the citizens.
I have taken it so much more easily what that the procedure chosen for said auditions has allowed to remember the commitment contracted by the Commission to present, before the end of the year 1999, a group of proposals allocated to give at last concrete content to the section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that consecrates the specificity of the regions *ultraperiféricas and *instituye in *pro of *ellas the right to particular disposals, derogatory, for *permitirles confront his structural difficulties.
On the other hand, for treating  of the *PTU associated to the European Union, the Commissioner *Nielson has recognised the need to present with the greater shortness a group of proposals directed to give to these countries a statute adapted to his current situation with seen to the next agreement of association, with the consequence in particular of the renewal of the financial instrument assigned to his development.
It treats  of a political decision that the parliamentary commission and the Commission of Control Budgetary have to adopt, and the message that, therefore, it is necessary to transmit to the Mrs. *Schreyer -#if it do not comes from of *usted, Mr. Commissioner, that come from, at least, of the services of the Commission- is that we want to celebrate early a meeting with the Mrs. *Schreyer to argue about the content of a *PRS5 that it will have to present to the Parliament it before possible and, it that it is even more important, include the additional personnel for *OLAF.
This Agreement went in in vigour on 24 October 1996 and his goal is to reach and keep a high level of nuclear security to scale world-wide, developing national measures and tightening the international cooperation, #as well as cater to the nuclear head offices of effective protections in front of possible radioactive leakages so that the individuals, the society and the environment find  to save of the harmful effects of the pertinent ionic radiations of these head offices.
Support it that has said before the Mr. *Swoboda, but in front of the situation that have at present in *Turquía, is to say, in front of the disposal to take advantage of the relations with the #european speakers, in the proposal of resolution of today #would have to talk of a mood much more concretise on the helps to *Turquía and show to our #turkish friends that are here *cuando need our help and *transmitirles the feeling of that they are not seen by *nosotros of a general mood like enemies, it that before the earthquake with frequency was like this.
The main purpose is to give a break to the budget *rectificativo and supplementary *nº 4/99, approved the past 16 September, proposing, in accordance with the proposal formulated by the Commission in this moment, fund greater credits; to know: for *PHARE 98 millions of euros, for *TACIS 68 millions of euros, for the humanitarian helps to *Turquía 15 millions of euros, for *Kosovo 21 millions of euros, for the cooperation with *Sudáfrica 20 millions of euros, for the environment and the tropical forests 10 millions of euros.
#If I have not understood badly, the next week will be *usted available also to examine the relative questions to the enlargement, but, like general principle, it that has initiated *usted today here is important and #would appreciate  the opportunity to continue this dialogue among our two institutions by means of appropriate mechanisms and formalised, already take part *usted personally or by mediation of other members of the School of Commissioners, as it proceed, in other weeks of celebration of partial periods of sessions, in function of the agenda.
In equality of conditions, #if it wants to, #can situate it in the first place, without embargo, in my opinion, the problem of the human resources is dramatically important for our continent and, #if no *le put remedy with urgency by means of a very wide program that take part in this sector, believe that not even the reduction of the taxes, in spite of having a content and to offer a very strong contribution, will suffice to achieve the development of the #european industry.
The *segunda question, that is related with the main object of my question, is #if it has not thought the Commission that, of #the same way that there #be a directive, the directive *SEVESO, that foresees the protection of the workers and of the citizens, in the zones of the facilities, in front of accidents in industrial companies, it #would be necessary to take #some measures for the protection, of the industrial companies especially, in front of natural catastrophes like the seisms.
It That then *sucedería is that the European Union  *jactaría to having reduced his pollution, to having reduced his broadcasts, but to the price of, in the first place, the loss of places of #european work, and second, the world #would not have reduced his levels of pollution in it more minimum; simply it #would have exported  the pollution.
This plan proposes also measures oriented to diverse sectors of consumption and allocated to intensify the knowledges in matter of energy and the practice in spheres like the acquisition of appliances, the utilisation of energy in the home, the facilities of the buildings, the systems of heating, the energetic management in the industry, the sector of the services and the public sector.
It wanted to add that, along the debate celebrated on 14 October in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, and to the sight of the worry shown in particular by the article 2, #all the members of the commission agree an amendment that now appears like last paragraph of the article 2 and that prays it following: "Said article will apply  without damage of the requirements of confidentiality established in the law, or was, in the Treaties, or established in the Regulation of the European Parliament" .
It is, for the European Union, the occasion to reaffirm his moral duty that consists in tending the hand to the world in development; the occasion to show until how point want to struggle against the poverty, against the injustice, against the discriminations of #all type, against the fault of democracy, against the attacks to the human rights and against the freedom.
In front of this Central Bank or to this saint Bank - do not know exactly how describe it -, of the *cual his vice-president, the Mr. *Noyer, *nos explained recently of a form affected, but in English, until how point #this felt  manager of the long term *cuando the governments yielded to the whims of the short term since they were subjected to the uncertainties of the universal suffrage, front, therefore, to any power of this Bank, the excellent report of the Mr. *Huhne demands more transparency, without *atreverse on the other hand to *reclamarle it that it #can happen by exhibition, is to say, go out of the anonymity of the decisions.
The #european citizens, gentleman President, interest  and concern  mainly by the content of the politics of the Central Bank European, of the European Union and of the States members; a politics that gives absolute priority to the called monetary stability and to the interests of the big financial capital, and the price that have to pay is a dramatic reduction of the employment and the total destruction of the called social model European.
The monetary orientations of the #ECB, that base  in the fulfillment of the Pact of Stability and of his criteria of convergence nominal and prevail the stability of prices, finish being determinants for the national and #european politics in the most diverse economic and social spheres, included the budgetary perspectives of the European Union and of the States members.
As probably it expected the Parliament, the summit was dominated inevitably by the direct conversations on *Chechenia, as it has indicated the Presidency, in the that the European Union *presionó by a reduction of the climbing, by the turn to the political dialogue, by a proportional utilisation of the strength to cut across the terrorism and by that find  a solution to the humanitarian crisis.
In this sense, want to manifest my coincidence with the Mr. *Hatzidakis and with *algún another orator and regret that the European Committee of Normalisation have not reached still an agreement that #would allow to the States members legislate according to it that it has to be the definite rule; and not to see *abocados, #if it is that today and along the next weeks are not able to modify the current Managerial, to legislate to go back to change shortly time the legislation, with #all the problems that *ello #would involve.
In the case of *Marruecos and of this agreement of fishing, neither is possible to go back to ignore the rights of the village *saharaui, beginning by his right to the self-determination, his right to constitute an independent State, #if it opts thus, and to protect the natural wealths of his territory, already treat  of the *yacimientos of phosphate or, in particular, of the resources of his maritime seaboard, that find  loomed by this agreement.
The question of the alimentary security has converted  in a look of crucial importance in our societies, #would say even a requirement of our *conciudadanos Thus, think that it is precise to proceed to scientific examinations more exhaustive in the breast of the Scientific Committee taking into account #all the most recent data in wait of the proofs of diagnostic precocious that #can apply to the alive animals and reinforcing the controls to #all the levels.
In the first place, #that, like the social speakers or the Central Bank, that have a direct influence in the factors of the equation #such as the training of the wages or the level of the types of interest and afterwards, second, in a particular group, the European Commission and the advisers of the Commission with seen, for example, to the combination of politics.
The recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0041/1999) of the Mrs. *Smet, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 93/104/*CE of the relative Council to determined looks of the ordination of the time of work, to include the sectors and activities excluded of said Managerial (8642/1/1999 - *C5-0036/1999 - 1998/0318 (*COD)).
And among the socialist amendments, there #be #one, that put of relief the Mrs. *Wallis, that signals the special position of the regions *ultraperiféricas, that find  totally separated of the community territory, very #move# away of *él and that, therefore, in the application of the community Right, of compliance with the new article 299.2 of the Treaty, #can not be regulated by #the same norms that apply  to the community inner market in the continental field.
In effect, like European Union and like States members, #would have to have the value to ask and favour the entrance of *cientos of thousands of persons that, today, only by the fact to come of out of the European Union #can cover the works with a level of innovation higher because it is not only the training of the hand of drama, of the strength of work at present existent inside the European Union that it #can take it.
. (IN) Gentleman President, the Commission has the pleasure to take part in it that it is the final step for the adoption of the Program *Daphne 2000-2003, a program of action community, of four years of length, based in the experience of the initiative *Daphne, *cuando the European Parliament in 1997, for the first time, included budgetary games to combat the violence against the boys, the teenagers and the women.
The Commission has employed in the last years credits to ensure the security of service of the nuclear head offices on the that today talk here while no  *desconecten, #if well #such measures centre  in improving the culture of security in these countries, in the creation of authorities supervisory independent or in the training of persons that #can exert #such supervision.
Known is that in the European Union keeps  in levels elevated the violence against the boys, the teenagers and the women, it that constitutes a rape of his right to the life, the security, the freedom, the dignity and the physical and emotional integrity, #as well as a grave threat for the physical and mental health of the victims of the violence.
The central goals in the case of *Afganistán are, #among others, the achievement of a stable peace, the promotion of the internal dialogue in *Afganistán backing, in particular, the fundamental paper of the Nations Joined, the advance of the stabilisation and of the development of *Afganistán by means of the peace and the intensification of the fight against the illegal drugs and the terrorism.
But, to answer to the question, #would signal that in *Yugoslavia, taking into account, for example, the measures of the police and his aggressive behaviour to the demonstrations, #as well as the attitude of the diet of *Milosevic to the press and to the freedom of information, the current circumstances are #such, that, by the moment, do not give  the necessary conditions to organise some free democratic elections in *Yugoslavia.
Without embargo, this report collects fundamental principles that *nos seem essential, like the principle of caution, the norms on the methods and the procedures of production; the report takes upsetting, in particular, in the labeling of the foods, to guarantee the application of the alimentary security, and in the need to adopt a more favourable position to the countries in roads of development.
This building *antipopular, *antidemocrático and authoritarian, built to serve to the big capital, will be demolished by the own villages, by means of the resistance, the intervention, the change of the correlation of strengths. To build the *Europa of the peace and the cooperation, of the friendship and the equality among the villages, of the true Democracy and of the Freedom, of the economic prosperity in benefit of the workers.
It is important that in this legislative diary collect  the special treatments that establishes the section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty *CE for the #french departments of *Ultramar, the *Azores, *Madeira and the Canarian islands, because, of not being like this, #would get to a position and to a situation in the *cual these #european regions, vital for each #one of our States and for the European Union, #would find  in absolute disadvantage regarding the group of the European Union.
Curiously, this disarmament *arancelario of the *APIM has not produced the effect wished in the sensitive industries of Canarians, by it that the #spanish authorities, the #canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested to the community authorities the modification of the Regulation *nº 1911/91 so as to paralyse the disarmament of the *APIM until June of the year 2000, subject that the European Commission has understood.
And finally, *permítanme take a reference to an absolutely key subject for *nosotros: the growth, the stability and the employment, subject in the that the line initiated in *Luxemburgo, followed in *Cardiff, Colony and *Helsinki, has to concretise in the next summit of face to the #portuguese Presidency because we understand that, to have a prosperous future in the Union, have to be able to be more competitive and generate more economic growth, but putting the emphasis in the employment and in the social cohesion, that is and has to be #ours first priority.
*Yo Believe that #all agree in that the citizens and citizen of *Europa have right to breathe a healthier air, and in the last publication of the European Agency of Environment signals  that in the majority of the cities reigns a pollution of the air that results hurtful for the health and that in the 115 #european cities of greater size almost 40 millions of persons are subjected to an upper level to the established in the guidelines for the quality of the air of the WHO, regarding a *contaminante at least.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5­0064/1999) of the Mrs. *González *Álvarez, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the common position adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  a plan of follow-up of specific broadcasts averages of dioxide of carbon of the new tourisms (*COM(1998) 348  *C­0041/1999  1998/0202(*COD)).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0044/1999) of the Mr. *Sjöstedt, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the proposal of decision of the Council on the approval, in name of the Community, of the amendments to the Annexes of the Agreement on the protection of the half marine of the zone of the sea *Báltico (Agreement of *Helsinki) (*COM(1999) 128 - *C4-0218/1999 - 1999/0077(*CNS)).
To reflect in the text of the proposal a suitable treatment of this no resolved problem, in the breast of the Council is  *consensuando the incorporation of a new point 7 in the that they collect  the external characteristics that they have to gather, for his commercialisation in the #mediterranean areas of the Community, the better forest species adapted to his difficult conditions of floor and climate.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, #all agree in that the common coin constitutes the previous condition so that the inner market work, in that a stable coin constitutes also a contribution to the social and economic security of *Europa and in that, by this reason, the euro is also, in definite, a successful history as it has had like consequence the reduction of the deficit in our States members and a descent of the inflation.
Although in this subject the commitment in our commission was especially arduous, the facts seem *darnos the reason since, after the political agreement reached in the Council of ministers last, so much the loins of tuna like the herring go out of the system of suspensions *arancelarias, in addition to another series of corrections that affect to other products comprised in the annex *V.
In it *concerniente to the organisations of producers, is truth that it is necessary *responsabilizarlas even more, #if it fits, so much regarding the organisation of the market as to the rational management of the resources; without embargo, #would be convenient -and in this sense underline the relevance of the amendment 67, presented by my political Group- that the States members #can concede complementary helps to the organisations of producers that boost measured of assessment of the species fished and of *adecuación of the offer to the demand through structural actions of the *IFOP.
Gentleman President, the Commissioner *Lamy and other orators have referred  to the meeting of *Seattle like a failure, but follow believing that #if the European Union and the States Joined, in particular, learn the lesson of these last weeks, the meeting of *Seattle #can happen to the history no like a failure, but like the moment in that the leaders of the world gave  account at last that they have to focus the international trade of a radically different way.
In general terms, treats  of an approach or, better said, of an intention *loable and in line with the Protocol of *Montreal that to #the same time, without embargo, do not takes into account #some facts. In the first place, the fact that the other countries signatories of the Protocol, among the *cuales are the States Joined, foresee terms longer for the cessation of the production of the *hidroclorofluorocarburos; second, that the *hidroclorofluorocarburos, to the sight of the current knowledges, represent the only true alternative, in the field of the *antiincendio, to the *halógenos, main enemies of the coat of ozone, #whose use is generalised in the countries in roads of development.
. Gentleman President, the Program *TACIS has devoted his best efforts to support to *Mongolia, *Rusia and the rest of the New Independent States in the realisation of reforms and in the political and administrative restructuring of his social and economic institutions to facilitate the construction of a democratic society that support  in an economy of market free.
To finalise wanted to reiterate my gratitude to #all the colleagues of the Commission of Environment, Public and Political Health of the Consumers for having given green light to the amendments presented by the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. I consider fundamental that the European Parliament talk today with an alone voice and issue a univocal signal regarding this crucial subject for the consumers.
We criticise the decision to develop the means of the European Union for the military management of crisis, in the field of a #european common politics reinforced in matter of security and defence, conceived in the development and the strengthening of the *pilar #european of the NATO, of #the same mood that refuse the militaristic vision of resource to the war for the resolution of conflicts international.
On our part, we do not see any better solution that the restoration of a new international order of the trade, that respect the sovereignty of the States, his rhythm and his modalities of development, that respect his traditions also, traditions that will not dissolve of a hit of wand magic because we will have imposed the elections, the human rights and it that call, too much *apresuradamente, democracy.
We have had #news that the sent special of the Mr. *Baker, that, as it knows *usted very well, has mediated among *saharauis and #moroccan with enough hit -also is #sad that was a North American and no a European the one who have mediated-, have had #news, say, that the Mr. Chat *Dunbar, special representative of the Mr. *Baker, has thrown the towel because it has said that it #can not bear that continuously the Realm of *Marruecos was against of the proposals that the Nations Joined take to speed up and to guarantee a just referendum regarding the autonomy of the *Sáhara.
The resolution approved yesterday by this Parliament will remain in the political history of this hemicycle like a characteristic central piece of the total absence by heart political, *definidora of the political hysteria that today is imposed by the manipulation *mediática to the service of interests *belicistas and aggressors and takes to forget the values of the peace, the justice and the sovereignty of the nations.
In the first place, it is truth that the calendar of execution is ambitious but it true is that we are progressing well, with the agreement on the *Euroinsignia ready of *concertarse; directives on the rail transport in front of the Council; the survey on the port costs in power of the States members; proposals on taxes of airports; aerial rates in study; the Committee of Experts Governmental has gathered  and has commissioned to the group of high level that inform on the methods followed to reckon the costs.
In this stadium, *nos seems that in the case of the States members that have insular character, already has signalled  in this House, has to *reflexionarse on the possibility of a relative regulation to the most strict weight that the proposal initially by the Commission. #This by the obvious reason that the communications with the rest of the #european market do not take place exclusively by road.
The frame of performance is directed to the European Parliament. The Parliament will exert a key function in the process of modernisation of the frame of the financial services, on the base of the results achieved by the group in that they take part the representatives of the ministers of Finances and of the report of the Parliament.
*Nos Serves of *algún comfort the fact that the program will see the light under the auspices of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and that the new article 152 on the public health allows to the European Community a wider action, more forceful and, expect, also more synergistic in the field of the prevention and of the fight against the illnesses, #as well as of the prevention of the violence.
Like the breweries *luxemburguesas #would not take at all in reaching said ceiling given the reduced dimensions of his market, this rule #would end in a totally absurd situation. It #can give the case that a big #german brewery, as for example the *Bitburger, #whose production surpasses with grow the of the greater brewery *luxemburguesa, #can follow signing agreements of supply of beer in *Luxemburgo with the bars *luxemburgueses, since it still #would not have reached the limit of the 40 % in the enormous market of #german reference, whereas the brewery *luxemburguesa no longer #would have this right and #would remain deleted.
This discussion comes of long and *yo say therefore that the European Commission acts in #this as #if it was the secretariat of the conservative strengths of the #ECB, that argue that the *segunda task that has the #ECB according to the article 105 of the Treaty, is to say the support to the economic politics *cuando the stability of prices remains sufficiently ensured, already is it sufficiently attended guaranteeing the stability of prices same.
*Cuando In the preparation of the Summit of *Luxemburgo presented the proposal on the designated social VAT -by true, was not the first because already *me had preceded #some *selectos members of this Parliament- was convinced to act following the spirit of the White Book of *Delors, that already had signalled that in *Europa  *nos had dipped in the head a system that has #put a lot the work, very expensive in comparison with the *despilfarro of energy, of matters prevail and with the total freedom of circulation of capitals.
*Usted Has situated the market in the central place and has declared that it is precise to take advantage of fully and in his whole the opportunities that #this offers, since #this is the most adapted road to promote the growth and the employment, but also has mentioned the frame of conditions and rules of the game *equitativas that they are necessary, since the market no the establishes by himself/hisself same.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0128/99), of the Mr. *Fitzsimons, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the measures that have to adopt against the broadcasts of gases *contaminantes and of particles *contaminantes pertinent of engines allocated to *propulsar agricultural or forest tractors and by the that modifies  the Directive 74/150/*CEE of the Council (*COM(98)0472 - *C4-0512/98-98/0247(*COD))
To the equal that the interim Agreement, this new Agreement collects with special emphasis it that has been #one of the main requirements of the European Parliament and to the that the Commission and the Council of ministers has awarded the maximum priority: the clause of respect to the democratic principles and to the fundamental human rights, like essential element and foundation of this relation.
The #german Presidency of the EU always has marked  like goal inform to the European Parliament on the advances of the *preparativos related with the integration of *Schengen. Therefore, *me cheer to have the opportunity to show it in the context of this debate, since the subject of the information and the form in the that #this has given  to know have exerted a fundamental paper.
This morning we have proposed that they are the president of the Commission of Subjects External, the president of the Subcommittee of Rights Human, the Vice-president of the European Parliament, *Renzo *Imbeni, and the president of the Delegation for the Relations with the *Europa *Sudoriental those who go to *verle so that *les inform of the situation in *Kosovo, his own experience and his proposals for the future.
I entrust in that the request of the European Parliament carry so much to the Council as to the Commission to quantify the financial endowment and/or the number of population admitted and the possibility to be able to award helps of State, without damage of *falsear the competition, on the base of the letter *c) of the section 3 of the article 92 of the Treaty, as it has taken  in other cases called special.
The Group of the Greens votes against the recommendation on the regulation of the Bottom of Cohesion because in *él has not had  seriously in account almost #any of the innovative requests formulated by the European Parliament in the first reading with the end to strengthen and integrate the paper of the Bottom of Cohesion inside the #european structural politics.
As *eso is like this and no of another way, *me see forced to *decidirme after a long reflection to back definitively the report on the reform of the Common Agricultural Politics in the frame of the Diary 2000 to end to give green light so that the political decision adopted by the ministers of Agriculture and the Summit of *Berlín #can be approved by the Council of Ministers in his legislative version.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, sure enough, as *usted has mentioned, the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers had presented a proposal of resolution but, to the sight of the presented so much by the Group of the European Popular Party as by the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, do not have any problem in *sumarnos to #the same, and #this is the reason by the that have withdrawn the #ours.
The negotiation on the *OMC, the world-wide trade, will be the bank of proofs for *Europa, to see #if it will be able to condition the absolute primacy of the free exchange of commodities, today dominant, to the needs of protection of the conditions of the workers in the world, of the environmental and sanitary conditions of the populations of the world and of *Europa in particular.
Finally, since have the time explained, wanted to simply *lanzarle a call saying that the Commission is not only the *ejecutante of the decisions of the Council or of the European Parliament and that now maybe have lost a bit the taste by the discreet charm of the norms with the lengths of the springs of elevators and that #would wish more initiatives of the Commission in relation with the problems of the civil society.
In effect, #if it reaches to carry to good term at the same time the extraordinary Summit of *Tampere, that *versará on the security of the citizens, the preparation of the *Europa of the defence by means of the integration of the *UEO in the European Union, the launching of a new round on the enlargement in December and, finally, the application of the Pact of Stability for the *sudeste of *Europa, the #finnish Presidency will have been a big Presidency of transition to the century *XXI.
I believe that, in front of the seriousness of the subject, had been preferable to have a statement of the President of the Commission, with seen to the document that expect of the Mr. *Kinnock, on the institutional reform, expect to a report elaborated by the competent organ of this Assembly and pose, in this moment, the position of the Parliament on the future operation of the Commission.
Regarding the transparency -already have said it, gentleman President- our Group *le awards his full confidence, a confidence that, obviously, depends of the results that *usted and his Commission will reach, a confidence that depends of the demonstration of the force of these great moral qualities and professional of each #one of the Commissioners, on the *cuales go to watch with #all the means and in #all the forms, also in those better forms of transparency that *usted *nos has guaranteed.
And it do not treats  of simple general subjects that have to resolve in a future, but that urge on purpose to the Council to that in virtue of the last tendencies in the field of the flows of refugees and in matter of asylum introduce by means of decision of the Council, the vote by majority in these subjects in the term prescribed of five years, with the automatic consequence that foresees  in these cases, to know, the respect of the rights of *codecisión of the European Parliament.
#If well we underline the interesting movement initiated in the relations among this institution and the Parliament, #as well as our will to work in *pro of the hit of the administrative reform announced, expressed the *convencimiento that, to answer to the hopes *apremiantes of our *conciudadanos, #would have taken is missing to take the initiative of changes significant that affect no only to the operation of the Commission, but also to his own political orientations.
The proposals on the help in the police and judicial collaboration in the penal questions, #as well as the distinct proposals on the creation of the juridical field European, conceal the help and the back enlargement of the operative possibilities of the *Europol and of the national authorities putting in grave danger the fundamental democratic rights and the public freedoms.
But precisely these same feelings *solidarios to the #turkish village, are the that demand that this catastrophe of the earthquakes was not considered like #one *coartada and that do not unblock  the bottoms of finance #if the #turkish diet do not advances in the fulfillment of the conditions on the respect of the human rights, of *Chipre and of the question *kurda, of #such way that show that, anyway, has the intention to give determined steps.
In *tercer place, finally, it is necessary to add, in the scientific field, the need to examine in detail and complete the knowledges and scientific methods that we have for the production of foods and *piensos safe; likewise, the methods of detection and the maximum of the different substances that contaminate the foods, #as well as the *adecuación of the pertinent alimentary ingredients of different animal or vegetal waste or of the recycling, as, for example, of the recycling of oils.
It Same fits to say on the review of the financial perspectives that it is necessary also owing to the help to *Kosovo, of the repair of the damages of the earthquakes of *Turquía and the agreements of fishing of *Marruecos, and is not *desligada of the fact that in the category *IV there #be not in this moment sufficient money to make #all these projects that the Council and the Commission want to carry out with his proposals.
The evaluation put of relief that *SAVE is a valuable normative instrument to boost the energetic efficiency, but underlined that it was necessary a clear and coherent strategy for the experimental actions, that the diffusion of the results is the key for the hit on a long-term basis and that the efficiency on a long-term basis requires to improve the permanent supervision and the analysis of the repercussions.
Of course, it is precise that work together with other organisations and thus had special care in giving account of our work with the #Red Cross, with the World-wide Program of Foods, with the *ACNUR and with other organisations involved, for example, the WHO, precisely to achieve that it remained clear that #this is a humanitarian operation; without embargo, believe that it also is positive that the population and the #serbian political class see that the rest of the world also is prepared to help of this form.
The statute of candidate and the signals of opening are well, always that it have  the value to repeat first of all to *nosotros same that it will be difficult to receive to *Turquía in the European Union while the #turkish Government follow ignoring the resolutions of the Council of Security on the invasion of *Chipre, while I continued denying the existence of a minority *kurda talking *genéricamente of terrorists, and while *Öcalan do not remain free of the threat of the pity of death.
*Le #Would ask to the President in exercise of the Council -since it do not has data on the reduction of the populations of tuna- #if has news on the failure of the *desovación of the salmon during the last year in the river of *Tornio, among *Finlandia and *Suecia, and #if the President in exercise of the Council will call the attention of the responsible Commissioner of fishing on the fact that the fishing with networks of mesh to the derives #would have to be limited also in the *Báltico and no only in the zones mentioned of the #atlantic tuna.
The market of work, the initial training and the continuous training are key sectors for the active promotion of the woman, and the measures of accompaniment, as for example the attention of the dependent persons, are very important precisely in the case of the women and contribute to *facilitarles the access to the market of work.
Also we have problems with the other categories, as for example in the category 3, that includes the that have been traditionally the central points of our politics: the environmental politics, the programs of training of the youngsters, the investigation, the networks *transeuropeas, with his opportunities for the creation of employment and the improvement of our to scale world-wide competitiveness.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, wish first of all congratulate to the #finnish Presidency by the hit that has been *Tampere when opening a new stage in the development of the #european citizenship, attending to the always difficult balance among freedom and security, and *ello shows that no only are taking a Union based in freedoms for the commodities, the services and the capitals, but also to answer to the freedom of establishment and of trip of the citizens and the citizens.
This reform, that #all know, in it deeper of *nosotros, that is necessary, is not only and neither in the first place question of time, is in the first place a question of will political, of lucidity on our own current operation and his insufficiencies; it is question of value, of collective value, that will have or will not have, to concede this time the priority to the Union, to concede the priority to a vision on a long-term basis, that surpasses -know it perfectly, although it was difficult- the prudences and the immediate interests.
And #this because, in spite of the fine will of each #one and of #a lot of colleagues - to those who *les give the graces - this Institution has not found any solution to the situation of the no inscribed deputies, a situation that is intolerable from the point of sight administrative and financial and even more from the point of sight of the parliamentary prerogatives. In effect, do not have faculties neither of amendment neither of resolution.
Before beginning to expose the position of the relative Commission to the amendments approved by the Parliament on 16 September, *permítanme take upsetting in that the Commission has tried to examine the suggestions of the Parliament with #the same spirit with the that am sure that the presented the Parliament, to know, #which is the best way to make our collective effort European on the terrain in *Kosovo and in #all the region.
In some mood, the cynicism of the method "*Michelin" has had like consequence #one *decuplicación of the phenomenon of rejection that causes increasingly this modern capitalist strategy, the of *share-*holder *value, the creation of values for the #shareholders, that consists in subordinating it all, and in the first place these costs *insoportables, in his opinion, that represent the places of work, to the requirements *bulímicas of the financial shareholders of the company.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0027/1999) of the Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism, on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 96/49/*CE on the approximation of the legislations of the States relative members to the transport of commodities dangerous by railway [*COM(1999)0157 - *C5-0005/1999 - 1999/0087(*COD)].
But helping of the best possible way to both parts: to *Angola, on the one hand, and to the States of the European Union and to the regions that fish, by #another, with the control of this Parliament and in accordance with the amendments that the Commission of Fishing has presented with regard to this important Agreement, that has, as it finishes to be reflected here, a remarkable political dimension, in addition to some economic and financial dimensions.
I believe that #if we do not tackle the look of the production of form integrated, is to say, from the moment in that they choose  the matters prevail of the car happening by the *manufactura of #the same, the process of production, the use and, finally, the recycled or final disposal of the car *cuando no longer uses it the buyer, do not go really to achieve take measures that are really significant in the field of the reduction of the gases of effect *invernadero.
I am totally in accordance with the observations of the Mr. *MacCormick on the situation of the artists, that it #would be necessary to extend to #all the field of the intellectual creation, that finds  with a deficit inside the European Community, especially in matter of external competitiveness, and am also in accordance with his observation on the need to guarantee the free circulation and the free exercise of the intellectual profession inside the European Community.
There #where the nuclear energy contributes to reach the goals of reduction of the broadcasts of CO2, increase simultaneously our environmental problems by the nuclear waste and *eso goes against of the goals of the communication of the here presented Commission, that pleads by a more effective integration of the environment in the energetic politics.
Without embargo also believe that it exists a contradiction that perhaps have to see in his whole with the fault of decision that exists in the energetic politics inside the European Union *cuando *usted sees to the dessert the security in the cases mentioned in the closing -in it that coincide with *usted-, but *cuando treats  of nuclear head offices *equiparables in the States of the *CEI, wants to guarantee said security by means of modernisations and the impulse of the measures of security by part of the European Union.
It thinks the European Commission keep the commitment purchased by the Commissioner Mr. *Brittan, in front of the Commission of Subjects External of the European Parliament, that of not to fulfil entirely the terms of the Agreement, the European Union #would go back to request the opening of a signpost in front of the instances of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade?
As it put  of self-evident in the historical meeting -is the adjective that, aptly, has used the High Representative- that has celebrated this week the Council of Subjects General to the that assisted the ministers of Defence, the States members believe that a greater cooperation in the field of the security and the defence in the European Union will contribute two main advantages.
In effect, of compliance with the article 18 of the Treaty of the European Union, the European Commission has to take part fully in #all the looks of the External Politics and of Common Security and our Group proposes  defend, therefore, in #all moment the interests of the Commission, because #this are also the interests of the European Union, and by #this go to collect also his collaboration in interest of *Europa, a collaboration that *yo believe that the personality of #both guarantees that it will be excellent.
And regarding the paper of the Parliament, believe that we have shown in these years our capacity of help and of accompaniment and understand that, from the point of sight of it that they #can and have to be the dimension and the development of the defence and the common security of the Union, #can exert an important paper in relation with the rest of the world; I believe that in this occasion have to offer our collaboration and #ours better attitude.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0056/1999) of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, on the common position of the Council (9150/1/1999 - *C5-0181/1999 - 1998/0192(*COD)))with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves  a program of action community (Program *DAPHNE) (2000-2003), on preventive measures allocated to combat the violence exerted on the boys, the teenagers and the women (Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea)
The second look *atañe to the agriculture for the *cual, together with a greater liberalisation of the market in favour of the countries in development, it is necessary to ask, apart from the maintenance of the community principles -the support to the environmental politics, the definition of an alimentary politics in defence of the consumer- the protection of the characteristics and of the agricultural products typically national
According to the article 18 of the conjoint Resolution of the Parliament and of the Council on the network of communications to #european level, the States members deliver regularly to the Commission his national programs and the programs that design to develop the network of communications to #european level, especially, the projects specified in the Resolution and that affect to the common interests.
Precisely the diffusion of the pity of death represents #one of the most intolerable rapes of the dignity and of the right to the life of each individual: a rape that regret deeply and to the that we want to face up remembering, for example, that #the same process of enlargement of the Union is showing  no only like a factor of peace and of security of the Continent, but also like a path so that the countries candidates surpass said barbarism.
It wanted to respect roughly my time of use of the word, but in the frame of this debate suits to remember that we do not have to take in consideration only the point of sight #nordic, neither the passion *desbordada of the *enamorados of the #austrian forests, but that go in in our zone, in the centre of the EU, and also in *Alemania, concede a big importance to the clauses of liberalisation, so as to that #all the approach follow being really feasible.
On #one of these products, for putting an example, the of the loins of tuna, said study is establishing levels of deficit of among 1.500 and 3.000 tonnes, is to say that, cheerfully and without data contrasted, the Commission was had to drown a community sector with thousands of places of work, #as well as his own systems of help to the development to the countries *SPG-Drugs and *ACP by a need of import real inferior to 3.000 tonnes that #can cover perfectly with the current system of contingents *arancelarios.
Also it foresees the Regulation that #if an elect deputy abandoned the Parliament before it approve  in the Plenary the present report, will examine  his vacancy and the provision of #the same, of compliance with the article 8 of our internal Regulation and in accordance with the applicable disposals of the Record of 20 September 1976, in a separate procedure, independent of this report and that will take place in the timely moment.
Since we consider to *Turquía like a fellow country, *nosotros wish that it achieve to build an authentic civil society, that achieve to concede a true identity to the *kurdos, as it splits ethnically differentiated of the population, obviously inside the #turkish state unit and in the frame of the #turkish nation, and entrust in that the military power Turkish, that is #allied of Occident -and #this is in reality it tragic-, also take into account the *proporcionalidad of the means in front of the problem *kurdo and, every time that they arise problems with the *kurdos, do not try *resolverlos by military means in place to resort to the dialogue.
The European Council of Colony decided that it drafted  a Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union before the European Council of December of 2000 and that the editorial ran to charge of an organ composed of 15 representatives of the Bosses of State or of Government, 16 deputies to the European Parliament, included His *Señoría, 30 deputies to the national parliaments and *yo, in representation of the President of the Commission.
Gentleman President, the budgetary discussion of this year has been so odd that, even among the speech of the general speaker, to the beginning of the debate, and my own intervention has *sucedido, by chronological order, it following: an informal meeting of the Commission of Budgets, a meeting of the budgetary Council and a meeting of the political groups.
Fifteen members are five less of the that has the Commission, but in a relatively small institution as it is the Court of Accounts, any new enlargement will suppose a marked increase of the weight of the cusp and a greater inertia, that already  self-evident very *nítidamente in the actuality in the excessive slowness of the necessary procedure until the Court of Accounts #make his report.
The plan no *carecía of this requirement and, therefore, focus this debate on the base that the plan of export in base to the date did not demand the establishment of said terms #would induce to deception, because it #would be unfair for the scientists that determined the necessary measures to guarantee that the export of meat of *vacuno #british did not encloses any danger, and also #would be unfair for the Commission in the approach that has adopted up to now.
I do not believe that they estimate  adequately neither that take  seriously in consideration, at least to judge by the debates that have kept  up to now -am new euro-deputy- the economic and social repercussions of the phenomenon of the illegal immigration, or, #if it wants , of the real immigration, even to *través of the legal procedure, by the parallel flow of illegal immigrants and the imminent pertinent flow of countries that will be community after the enlargement of the European Union.
The third question treats of my worry by these #round-up, because it do not believes *usted that because of the #round-up through other States members of a same linguistic territory is very easy *torpedear the only price of the books and that results little effective to protect the special value of the book like cultural object and the special meaning of the market of the book for the culture?
It That has reached  in one hundred years in the space *germanófono among *Austria, *Alemania and Swiss; it that has taken possible and guaranteed a big diversity; it that do not deletes in any case the competition, but that has by consequence ensure the to scale general supply by means of great and small bookshops in the cities and in the field, #can not abandon to the *desenfrenada #blackmailer pressure of the strongest operators in the market, neither in the business of the bookshops, neither in the of the sale by catalogue, neither in the electronic trade.
This Parliament, the European Parliament, has the moral obligation to express his solidarity with the #afghan women, to request to the UN that take part more actively, to ask to the States members that follow without recognising the diet of the Talibans until #this access to respect the human rights and put end to the discrimination of the woman.
Subject: The euro and the speech of the Mr. *Joschka *Fischer on 12 January 1999 In his speech in front of the European Parliament, the President of the Council said that the introduction of the euro supposes no only great changes but also an equal risk of great, for example, #if, like logical consequence of this audacious step, the EU did not give also equal steps of audacious to a total integration.
Second, an investigation made by own initiative concerning the public access to the documents, supported by the parliamentary commission by pipe of the report of the Mrs. *Thors and by the European Parliament, has taken that #all the institutions and the community organs interested have adopted norms on the public access to the documents, except in the case of the Court of Justice.
Regarding the governments of the States members -that when seeming are not represented today- by pipe of his representations in front of the European Union or collectively in the Council, his cooperation with the Commission did not #be *rebasar the minimum possible level and are not had to send civil servants to the parliamentary commission to argue with his members about the value of a request.
Gentleman President, gentleman Defender of the Village, as every year, the discussion of the relative annual reports to the activities of the Commission of Requests and of the Defender of the Village *nos offers the occasion to remember the importance that *revisten these two organisms in the establishment of bonds of confidence among the community institutions and the citizens of the States members.
I ask likewise that the European Parliament  *erija in promoter of an initiative of solidarity, also economic, in favour of the inhabitants of *Apulia that no only have received and follow receiving generously to *decenas of thousands of #albanian and #kosovar refugees, but that pay *duramente the cost of the war in terms of logistical difficulties with the closing of the airports of the region and with the damages *ocasionados to #all the tourist sector *pullés that suffers the cancellations of the that renounce to happen his holidays in said region.
Like an important part of common effort, the Commission proposes to give the possibility to the companies of transport of the Community to use a maximum weight of the vehicle of 44 tonnes, but exclusively *cuando the transport by road referred  to a specific part of a transport combined and only in routes relatively short of the total distance of the transport combined.
We have given #ours more cordial thanks to the president of the Commission of Regulation, the Mr. #Ben *Fayot, -and in this point coincide fully with our colleague, the Mr. *Corbett- for having treated of a so fast way and so cooperative the wish that manifested the Commission of Control Budgetary to the Commission of Regulation, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities.
Besides I have to *decirles, *Señorías, that the economic orientations here presented only follow betting by a politics of saving even more strict for #a lot of States members, with the idea that it #can create  employment with flexible wages, with a deregulation of the labour market and with the dismantlement of the social protection, and *eso is not exactly my idea of a #european strategy for the employment.
This vote, with the that the deputies exert our condition of representatives of the #european citizens without any *condicionamiento of the national Governments, goes to be decided in the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left in accordance with the commitments that purchases the candidate in his political orientations generals and in a clear program of reforms of the own Commission.
Gentleman President, so much in the statement of the President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, of the past month as in the of today, have valued the commitment to make the necessary reforms to renew and reinforce the European Institutions, and especially the commitment of an increasingly transparent Commission, school and effective, #as well as the of a greater paper of the Parliament and of the enlargement of the vote by majority of the Council.
In this proposal of modification, the Commission inserts, in the article 28 of the directive, a section 6 new, by the that introduces a procedure of permission so that the Council resolve by unanimity to proposal of the Commission, allowing that the States members that wish it apply a type reduced to determined local services with big intensity of hand of drama and that fulfil precise requirements, during the period comprised among 1 January 2000 and on 31 December 2002.
Gentleman President, the great orientations of the economic politics for the next year are dominated by an unexpected shadow to the eyes of the official experts: #one *desaceleración of the growth in *Europa of roughly the 2 %, joined to the maintenance of a tax of unemployment elevated, of roughly the 10 % in the whole of *Europa, whereas the States Joined register a growth of more of the double and an unemployment of two lower times.
But the Commission of Environment has accepted a series of proposals with the intention to intensify seriously the protection of the consumer. Without embargo, am convinced that with a minimum directive, a right of retractation of 30 days, the delivery during the negotiations of a complete agreement complicated *jurídicamente and a summary, did not achieves  the goal that pretends .
In the big debate that today *nos occupies on the minimum and maximum harmonisation, the that defend, as it takes it the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, the minimum harmonisation, take it no because they wish to put *coto to the demands of Internet, but because they do not want to see diminish the protection to the consumer of way significant in each Been member in it individual, it that it #can *suceder, had explains the level of information provided in the managerial #such as it is.
It is a hit that today #can it debate, since with this regulation will take  an important contribution for the protection of the environment, but also facilitates  the commercialisation of these tractors inside the European Community #as well as also the access of manufacturers #european to the market of third countries through the equivalence created among the community legislation and the regulation of the *EC-UN *nº 96.
His serenity, his capacity to mediate among the differences and opposite points *nos have impressed really of deep mood and personally have learnt to know in *usted beside his sense of impartiality also his understanding by the increasing tasks of this Assembly, as this Assembly has grown in this period of term of office at least a head.
I consider that, in a context of austerity budgetary, the Council and the Commission have had the good sense to concentrate helps in the Objective regions 1, it that goes to allow that, in terms of help *per *cápita , keep  the current levels of support and that, besides, keep  the Bottom of Cohesion, collaborating to accelerate the recovery of the structural dynamics in the less prosperous States.
It suffices with saying that, like result of the debates that have taken place during the #austrian and #german presidencies -the last of the *cuales has carried out great and *loables efforts to be able to get to an agreement with the Council before finals of June-, and thanks to the remarkable parliamentary contribution by means of the resolution of the past September and, now, of the report of the Mrs. *Aglietta, #everything seems to indicate -like this expect it- that we have got to the final stage of the negotiations.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To4-0155/99) of the Mr. *Pronk, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and of the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres (13836/4/98 - *C4-0003/99-95/0235(*SYN)).
Once again, the Group of Independent by the *Europa of the Nations reiterates his wish that the European Union allocate his efforts to the existent common politics (*PAC, *PCP...), in place to disperse  among some fields always more numerous, to risk to aggravate the dissemination, necessarily ineffective, of the public bottoms and to boost an inflation, always *perniciosa, of the public cost.
In this look, the European Union has expressed his conviction that the creation of a #palestinian State sovereign, democratic, viable and peaceful, on the base of the existent agreements and by the road of the negotiation #would be the best guarantee of security for #Israel and of regional acceptance, by it that has declared  had to consider in his moment the recognition of a #palestinian State.
The fault of commitment with the basic principle of no discrimination, the character limited of the field of application relative to the persons and to the objects and the definition little *convincente of the obligations are sufficient reasons to ask  how the European Parliament #can *erigirse in front of the affected like *garante of minimum norms and minimum commitments *cuando the representatives of his interests do not know to negotiate.
Gentleman President, *me *congratulo that my last intervention of this term of office refer  to an important sector: the textile industry and of the #european preparation, an industry that employs generally hand of feminine drama, a pertaining industry to the frame of the #SME that often covers the rural zones, an industry, finally, #whose future depends closely of the application of norms commercial *equitativas.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, *Señorías, of course the #german Presidency of the Council has seen  *eclipsada by the war of *Kosovo. Thus, it is necessary to ascertain that the position of the Presidency, of the that it is responsible the Federal Government German in this question, only has been able to  keep because it has been supported without reservations by the parties of the Union whereas *usted, estimated colleague *Fischer, #would have left abandoned *gustosamente to his own followers in his shoes of sport #if it is that still the carry.
For *reconquistar said confidence have to act with decision, without embargo, will reach it only #if we confront those problems that have an authentic importance in the daily life of the citizens as, for example, the employment, the economic growth and the challenge of the sustainable development to ensure the balance among the creation of wealth, the social justice and the quality of life.
Here yes, gentleman President, #would take lacking flexibility, no of the market of work, but of the Pact of Stability, to reach perhaps his suspension and, anyway, to be able to consider out of *él the investments of the growth and to be able to propose a politics of expansion of quality, things without the *cuales do not exists possibility #any neither of *paliar the democratic deficit neither to reduce the distrust that the #european populations have to his current Institutions.
As well, #if *usted considers that, in these conditions, *Pristina constitutes an ideal place to install a centre of direction, a central administration of the program for the group the *Balcanes, no only for *Kosovo, then *me fear that his observations are not sincere, his observations are loaded of political intention, and *me ask how a Commission that *carece already of political mandate and #whose credibility is in *entredicho, especially as a result of the case *Bangermann,  *atreve to adopt position and rush forward against the decisions of the Council of Ministers.
Gentleman President, is a pity that in the first intervention that  *me allows to make as new deputy have to talk of some grave errors committed in my country, in the first place in companies that supply the matter prevails of the *piensos for animals, afterwards in the services of control commissioned to discover any failure that produce  and to limit his consequences; also, and especially, in the Administration of #that then that was losing the time during weeks and that *nos has prejudiced enormously by not communicating to time to the European Commission and to the States members it that was occurring.
And *yo wanted to, through *usted, ask to the European Parliament that, in the first place, support the efforts of #all the political strengths for *propiciar a dialogue among #all the political representatives; second, that this Parliament request *encarecidamente to ETA the definite abandonment of the violence, and, in *tercer and last place, that also #can agree programs to help to the victims, to the *reinserción of the prisoners and by the education for the peace in the Basque Country and in *Irlanda of the North.
They have despised the capacity of this Parliament to exert of autonomous way the competitions that *le attribute the Treaties, with the result of the current situation: the impression, in the public opinion, that we #can not *pronunciarnos on the future Commission without a report that, by very important that was and by very expert that they are his authors, is not determinant for our political decision.
A complex organism like the European Union #can not dispense of the continuous relation with his inhabitants, final addressees of #all his decisions and political; without embargo, the process of unification #can not advance without the conscious backrest of the citizens, without the disappearance of the unemployment and the creation of a new economic development.
Gentleman *Prodi, the Group of the Environmentalists *le has suggested to modify the cast of wallets in the breast of his squad because, in addition to the integrity and the competitions of each commissioner, consider that his personal commitment and his determination to defend the matters that  *les have entrusted in the perspective of #one *Europa federal are also an element of assessment important.
In the first place, the commitment to gather  what before with the members of the commission to conceive a new program of social action that cover #all the mandate of the new Commission and recognise the realities of the new world that has brought achieve the euro and the new possibilities that give off of the Treaty of *Amsterdam to boost the employment and the opportunities and struggle against the insecurity and the exclusion.
Gentleman *Prodi, estimated candidates to Commissioners, the enlargement, the external politics and of security, the strengthening of the free trade in the world, the opening of new markets, the continuation of the liberalism in *Europa with a greater competitiveness for our common coin and a forceful environmental politics, are subjects for the that *Europa goes to need a strong Commission and that work well in the that *usted, professor *Prodi, goes to have our confidence and approval for his squad.
The European Parliament, by his part, loans  to the game with *delectación, since the text presented to vote titles  "Project of decision on the election of the Commission designated", *cuando, in reality, results more that evident that do not treats  of an election neither in the level of our Assembly, in the that of it that treats  *jurídicamente is of the approval of the designation of the Commissioners, neither to *fortiori in the level of the constituents that, at least in *Francia, and surely in #many other countries never have heard to talk of the Mr. *Prodi.
In wait of an indispensable *reorientación of the political axes of the Commission and a debate on the future action, has to interpret  the positive vote of today like the option in *pro of not multiplying the crises, the blockades, in our institutions, like the refusal to look for individual piacular goats *cuando it that is in *entredicho is the political orientation and the model of civilisation of *Europa.
Therefore, it is necessary a firm political will to end to support the following steps of the international community so that there are not #indonesian conditions in relation with the intervention of these strengths and so that, was *cual was the grade of conflicts in the territory, #can guarantee  the peace and the security to the *timorenses and the humanitarian support and the development that *Timor so much needs.
Also we want to take part actively in the corresponding negotiations and *asegurarnos that the instruments of the Union are in concordance with the future Convention. With this end, the last Presidencies of the Union, after the request presented by the Council in October of 1998, have conciliated his positions regarding the fight against the delinquency organised in the meetings in *Bruselas of mixed commissions and of the Committee *K.4, the *cual works in fulfillment of the article 36, #as well as in the negotiations that celebrate  in *Viena.
Among my dispatch and the services of the Parliament has glided  *algún error and #would want to say, to facilitate the things to the President in exercise, that the question is the following: whereas the citizens of the States Joined go in freely in #all the countries of the European Union, the citizens of determined countries of the European Union need visa of the North American embassy to go to the States Joined.
Subject: Construction of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos Has knowledge the Council of the project of construction of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos for *desalinizar waters of the sea and, in his case, #can consider argue with the alternative #moroccan government to this project, in view of his eventual environmental effect and of the dangers for the security of the zone?
To begin, *permítame express the gratitude of the Commission by the thorough report of the Commission of Development and Cooperation and by the support received during the procedure of query to the efforts of the Commission of face to the celebration of the *Décimo Agreement among the Community and the Organism of dramas public and aid of Nations Joined for the refugees of Palestinian in Orient Half.
By these reasons, receive with *beneplácito the commitment of the Commissioner *Byrne to concede the maximum priority to the *inocuidad of the foods and also the statement that took the President of the Commission, Roman *Prodi, in this Assembly on 23 July, *cuando said that #one of the first tasks of his Commission #would be the to restore the confidence of the consumers in the security of the alimentary products.
In this context, two have to be, to my trial, the immediate goals of this Assembly: take operative the parliamentary structures of the forum *euromediterráneo in the understanding that it #can mean an useful instrument to ensure the peace, and translate to the practice the initiative of the Speaker of the Parliament, the Mrs. *Fontaine, to make #one turns by the region.
Now well, the States Joined are *signatarios of the International Agreement of Civil Rights and Politicians, of the Agreement against the Racial Discrimination, #as well as of the Agreement against the Torture, that applies  in the case of *Moumia, since the racial factor weighed a lot in his process, and the seventeen years that has happened in the runner of the death constitute, according to these treaties, an unfair punishment, equivalent to a torture.
Gentleman President, costs the pity stand out that we are getting at the end of a period of five centuries during the *cual the only way to authenticate documents and transactions was the signature written or the signature certified, etc. Now, in less time that the half of the life of a person, go in in a world that goes to be dominated by the electronic trade, by new technologies and by signatures that do not exist in the ancient meaning of the word and that, therefore, it will be necessary to authenticate of an unpublished way.
The most important has been that this year have had to live the experience of a war in #european territory, a war caused by the gravest rapes of the human rights and by the politics of expulsion of population and ethnic cleansing carried out by the diet of *Milosevic; a political that #one *Europa democratic and a democratic community of nations, engaged with the defence of the human rights, #can not tolerate.
In this context *yo also wanted to highlight, nevertheless, that no only treats  to begin to give answer to the priorities in the field of the external politics, as for example the reconstruction of *Kosovo, but that to be able to *organizarlas and *impulsarlas of reasonable way is precise that the Council also approximate  to the position of the Parliament regarding the organisation of this help and to the operation of the future agency for the reconstruction of *Kosovo.
Without embargo, *me disappoints that they are taking  reductions in the global budgetary endowment, but expect that the European Council, *cuando get the moment to review the *segunda reading of the budget of the EU for the year 2000, take into account the recommendation of this Parliament to increase the finance of the program until 67 millions of euros or 53 millions of #irish pounds in the assignment of the next year.
Given the commitment collected in the Treaty of *Amsterdam to incorporate the interests of the consumers to #all the other areas of performance of the EU and the level *irrisorio of the budget for the politics of the consumers, that situates  in a 0,25% of the total of the cost of the EU, is necessary to begin by *asegurarnos that they keep  valuable programs like the plan of distribution of milk in the schools.
It has to treat of a misunderstanding because it that the Federal Reservation publishes two times to the year in his report *Humphrey *Hawkins for the Senate is a series of figures for #one those that indicators constituting the series the individual forecasts of the members of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, *provenientes of the regional banks of the Federal Reservation.
It is an integral strategy and unified oriented to strengthen the fundamental subjects of the country like the research of the peace, the reflation of our economy and the generation of employment, the protection of the human rights, the strengthening of the justice and the increase of the social participation.
#If the package is wider, #can result easier reach an agreement and easier his ratification in our States members, but in name of my Group #can affirm that we are had to that the Parliament collaborate closely with the Commission in the spirit that finishes to indicate the Mr. *Barnier, so that together #can put on the table of the *CIG a package balanced of proposals that *él and our representatives in #all the meetings of the *CIG #can defend: a package that prepare to the Union so that it work *cuando have more of 20 States members.
(The Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98/4 relative to the maximum limits of broadcast and poured to the production of chloride of vinyl *monomérico, and the Decision *OSPAR 98/5 relative to the maximum limits of broadcast and poured in the sector of the chloride of vinyl (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0016/1999 - 1999/0098(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer)
By it other, *Señorías, this new and grave case, that has impressed in *Francia to the media and to the political world, sample, #if it still was necessary, the urgency of measures firm and pertinent in *Europa to conciliate the economic performance and the social guarantees, the growth and the employment, the freedom of company and the defence of the wages.
#If now the Commission do not uses #all the necessary energy to protect this *pilar fundamental of the common politics of the fishing, as they are the agreements *pesqueros, then the pressure of the professionals of the sector #would be important and founded, to end to demand the *cuestionamiento of the politics *pesquera common and the *restablecimiento of a bilateral frame, that allow the direct celebration of agreements of fishing among States members and third countries, that #would respect and #would defend better the vital interests of our villages.
There #be an agreement reached among the two parts of the industry of the maritime sector, there #be a relative specific proposal to the persons of the sea that take scale in ports of the Community, but also there #be an Agreement of the *OIT, the *nº 180, and, in fact, the agreement among the two parts of the industry of the maritime sector based  in very big measure in the Agreement 180 of the *OIT.
Sure that it is not a fully satisfactory solution for the doctors, but in this so complex subject have to take into account the politics of the States members on the systems of health national, on the reality of each country, on the period in the that the doctors are in training and that it is a transitory period and like this try find, with realism, an intermediate solution that *nos allow, finally, step but.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0048/1999) of the Mrs. *Quisthoudt-*Rowohl, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the conclusion of the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Russian Federation [*COM(1999)0324 - *C5-0083/1999 - 1999/0133(*CNS)]
The amplitude of the discussion and the varied suggestions that produced  in the breast of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects and that referred  of way very general to the politics of employment *me moved to make in the project of my report a division in conclusions, on the one hand, and in a legislative part, by #another, the *cual concentrates  in the proposals for the guidelines of the year 2000 that they have to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in December of 1999.
*Me Seems insufficient the coordination among the labour politics, of employment, of government of the market of work and the politics that *inciden in the structural factors and in the frame *macroeconómico; *me seems insufficient the level of structuring, of investment in effective community Institutions and able to govern these processes for the *cuales no only is sufficient the respect to the competitions and to the prerogatives of the national states.
And since they have listened  #a lot of interventions and proposals of his *señorías on the paper of the Commission in the institutionalisation of goals for a more resolved action, want to stress that the #european strategy for the employment happens by the support and the impulse of the national politics and in this frame try to keep the narrowest collaboration possible with the States members.
Gentleman President, have to say that it manifested by the Mr. *Vattimo do not corresponds to the reality because the Speaker of this Parliament limited  to mention *cual was the vote in the Plenary on a resolution of the European Parliament that invited to #all the States members to respect the commitment of the parity of the educational system, or was, to facilitate the parity of the educational system.
Regarding the question of the permeability among these two categories, *me allow to call the attention on the fact that we will debate on how #can  *reagrupar the credits that in the agricultural sector -and here in the categories 1To and the measures of regulations of market that did not employ  because of the evolution of the prices and of the market and that then #can be available for other measures- in the frame of the debate on the next report.
In my opinion, only the EU is able to take it, needing an active strategy that, by a part, take upsetting in the efforts in the community field and in the active cooperation, especially with the countries in development, *ayudándoles so that his energetic systems are more ecological and, by #another, show that in fact it #can  change of course without great costs, since they are #many the environmental benefits that obtain  when limiting the dependency of the fossils.
The Commission follows very concerned by that there have not been tangible advances up to now by part of the States Joined in his commitment with seen to the modification by the Congress of the Title 4 of the law *Helms-*Burton, especially because the Government of the States Joined has remembered periodically that, of not to take this modification, the President is forced to impose the application of the Title 4.
They cover, among other things, the compensation, the psychological treatment and doctor, the assistance to the victims for the collection of the debts, the transmission of the decisions of a Been member to #another to improve the protection of the victims or ask to the courts that accept the testimonies written of the victims that #can not assist to the seen of the courts against his aggressors for living in another Been member.
Besides, the Council has communicated that is had to support, using #all the means near at hand of the European Union and of the States members, the development of other sources of energy electrical to substitute to the nuclear head offices little reliable, taking into account, to #the same time, the global situation and the characteristics and own needs of each country.
My question to the Council is the following: had account of this terrible precedent, is had the Council to consider the possibility of *presionar to the authorities of *Myanmar so that they declare a total amnesty for this type of prisoners political and, in this same sense, has treated in #any occasion the Council on the possibility to impose economic sanctions to *Myanmar until it adopt a political more humanitarian?
. (*FR) The cycle of the #Millenium, that will initiate  *próximamente in the breast of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, the *OMC, has to be the occasion, for *Europa -place that  *nos has imposed the condition to have to talk with an alone voice-, to show  no only joined during the course of the negotiations, but also show the greater firmness regarding the results, specifically regarding the agriculture and to the cultural exception.
It True is that this goal appears around questions so notable like the alimentary security, the public services or the "intellectual property", always in favour of a blind liberalisation of the financial capital and without respecting the labour norms of the *OIT and the environmental norms internationally approved and with consequences *nefastas for the cultural identity of the villages and the own development of *decenas of countries, in particular of the poorest.
It did not fits the lower doubt that the difficulties are still #many, already was in the sphere of the humanitarian help or in the of the support to the reconstruction or even because they follow producing grave rapes of the human rights, especially in the western part of *Timor, with the activity of the militias, that have prevented the *reagrupamiento and the return of the refugees of *Timor Oriental to his houses and to his earths.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the continuation of the debate of the report (To5-0063/1999) of the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, of Justice and of Inner Subjects, on the communication of the European Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on a plan of action of the European Union in matter of fight against the drug (2000-2004) (*COM(1999)239).
I say it also in name of our absent mate #Jan *Andersson, the one who - now will go back on *ello -, in what #swedish deputy, was in an especially difficult situation because *Suecia is #one of the States members that has a very special approach in politics of resultant drugs of his experience and of his national tradition and, without embargo, create, has procured, precisely in the amendments of transaction, Mrs. Deputy, get to a wide agreement with *usted in the final editorial of this report.
I believe that the words of the Mr. *Medina *Ortega have been *clarificadoras regarding the approach and to the posture -to the that it has got  by unanimity in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market- with regard to a transcendental subject, an important subject for the Canarian islands, but that has a reflection on the rest of regions *ultraperiféricas of the European Union.
It knows  that this country has *subscrito agreements to inferior price to the real cost of the production benefiting of the international supports, by mediation of the International Monetary Bottom, after the #asian crisis, it that is disturbing the wallets of requests of the countries of the European Union, as they have manifested the business organisations of the sector.
Finally, wish *referirme, because I proceed also of a peripheral region, to the enormous impact in the regional development that has the naval industry, *asentada in #many of these regions, in big part included also in the Goal *nº 1 of the #european regional politics, with *importantísimos dockyards generators of #a lot of direct and indirect employments, a social balance of the that so needed are the countries of the cohesion, that demand the #european solidarity.
The works initiated in *Tampere with seen to the preparation of a Letter of rights fundamental and the possible reform of the Treaty to separate the fundamental and essential acts of the disposals of application: in this way, they #would convert  in more comprehensible the essential acts and #would speed up  the procedure of modification of the less essential acts.
I believe that this Parliament did not has to conform with asking take part in the works of the Conference, #as well as in the of the preparation of the Letter of rights fundamental, but that it has to pretend act like a true Parliament and pretend likewise that, with occasion of the Conference *Intergubernamental,  *le return the right to decide *autónomamente his place of meeting not to be forced to work with his Secretariat in three different forums.
Finally, it wanted to remember that, #if the relative disposals to the group of the planned helps, comport a finance in three years of 150 millions of euros, the balance in favour of the Union of the commercial scales among *Turquía and the European Union duplicated  from the entrance in vigour onº 1 January 1996 of the agreement on the Union *Aduanera and in four years happened of four one thousand millions to eight one thousand millions of euros.
The monetary politics did not goes to be in conditions to reinforce the credibility of the #european integration in favour of the growth, of the employment and even of the investment, #if to #the same time that in the unification and centralisation of the monetary politics the States members of the European Union do not put  of agreement also in the signals against the *dumping public prosecutor, against the *dumping social and in favour of a greater employment.
. (*FR) In spite of his very limited character and clearly insufficient in attention to the problem treated, *nosotros will vote positively the relative directive to "the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of the health and the security of the workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres", in the measure in that it #can represent a progress in the countries in that the workers are less protected.
Also in relation with the day of the Monday, is to say, today, concerning the recommendation for the *segunda reading on the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone and the proposal of resolution on the labeling of edible produced from organisms genetically modified, the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer asks that they displace  these two points, in view of that his examination in the Plenary #would coincide with the meeting of the Commission, it that #would not be practical precisely.
The negotiations have to restart in the field of the World-wide Organisation of Trade and *Europa has to be fully conscious of his paper, a paper of balance and responsibility, with regard to a globalisation with human face, open and available to the changes and to the accelerations of the economy, but also able to protect the right to the work and to the defence of the environment and of the health.
I believe that *ustedes have put in clear that the European Union is in conditions no only to assume a paper leader in the frame of this round of negotiations and also in the frame of the next world-wide round, that do not take part here like players of *póker to impose our interests but that also are had to receive on board to the other nations, especially to the nations in roads of development and to the less developed countries.
The Parliament wished to go further of it that proposes the Council in the fight against the juvenile unemployment and of long length, especially by means of an integration on a long-term basis in the market of work through an intensification of the active measures in front of the passive, or was, increasing the proportion of unemployed that receive initial professional training and of improvement or of professional reconversion, as the fault of places of work is only a face of the coin.
Since it listens  and it reads  with frequency that the responsible networks of the traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that the cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of the transport of the material in question makes  by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is the posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront those countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
Taking into account the existent bonds among the Council *ECOFIN and the Council of Governors of the *BEI, #can indicate the Council #if it thinks to take measures to take more transparent and accessible the relative information to the decisions of the *BEI, in particular *cuando these decisions have important repercussions in the development of a region, and #if it do not considers that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the activities of the *BEI introducing procedures of management and financial accounting in the that they take  fully in consideration to the costs related with the environment?
Subject: 50 anniversary of the Agreements of Gin In the context of the 50 anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, and to the sight of the conflicts armed that they have developed  in the world in the last years, especially the that have had like stage the #european continent, how reflection #can take the Council on the state of fulfillment of the humanitarian International Right that contain the mentioned agreements of Gin?
Gentleman President, the Council *le remembers to the Mr. deputy to the Parliament that the Council adopted the Directive 91/628/*CEE, that remained modified by the Directive 95/29/*CE, on the protection of the alive animals during the transport, by means of the *cual remained ratified the applicable rule to the transport of animals in #all the territory of the EU, included the norms on the maximum time of transport for different animal species.
Since it listens  and it reads  with frequency that the responsible networks of the traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that the cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of the transport of the material in question makes  by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is the posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront those countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
The Council has not agreed that it produce  a postponement of a year, but that has given  by fine a conclusion that is of the following tenor: #if the Parliament accepts an amendment to this report, that treats of the labeling, and do not leaves to happen the proposal of the Commission without presenting amendments, the Council, then, will not accept this modification and will not follow the procedure simplified.
Subject: The insular regions in the new context of the Treaty of *Amsterdam The article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam establishes that the Community will propose  reduce the delay of the less favoured regions or insular and the statement *nº 30 *aneja to the Treaty recognises that «the insular regions suffer of structural disadvantages linked to his insular character #whose permanence prejudices to his economic and social development».
*Me Seems, in this sense, important #emphasize the importance of the acceptance by part of *Praga of the principles in the that is based the external politics and of common security and that, even, have been the Government of the Czech Republic the one who have taken the initiative to reinforce the political cooperation among the countries candidates to the adhesion to the European Union.
In the current proposal, the Commission presents it following: integration in a budgetary line of #all the activities in the field of the customs, training of the civil servants and computer projects. The creation of another committee of representatives of the States members has to conduct to a greater implication of the States members in the program and, as *tercer point, the opening of the program to the countries associated.
From the point of sight of the industrial development there are responsibilities, also of the #italian Government: the development of the petrochemical company of Carry *Marghera has revealed , definitely, *desestabilizador for the delicate balances of the lagoon, without embargo, #if we want to #one *Europa -as it said the President commissioned Mr. *Prodi- that head the new business initiatives, our obligation is to reach that these new business initiatives have in #Venecia #one of his main centres propellants.
#All know that in numerous occasions the Parliament has shown  favourable to the introduction of a #european tax, and in this case, *socarronamente, when declaring  in favour of a text that allows to the States members reduce the taxes, tries to modify the juridical foundation of the Treaties modifying the procedure of approval of the fiscal proposals of the Commission in the breast of the Council.
From Colony has to split a signal in this direction; it has to take a decision that give start to the political union; it has to remain patent the will to follow this path and has to remain clear that the European Union has the intention of *erigirse in subject active in the international relations and in the eventual crises, because has the purpose to endow  of #all the necessary instruments, indispensable and apt to guarantee his sovereignty and autonomy.
With regard to the financial system: the European Council has recognised the existence of disequilibriums budgetary in the finance of the Union and has foreseen modifications in the system of resources own existent that have more in account the financial capacity of the States members establishing like this a greater justice in the contributions.
In this frame and, #if well *nos #would enjoy to support and *incentivar unconditionally the new agreement *interinstitucional by reasons of principle and to guarantee the stability and allow the planning, is not less true that the commitment that comports regarding the financial frame approved with the quoted characteristic *nos arouses #some reservations, that increase more by the absence of a deep reform of the *PAC, that advocate, or also by the tenor *innegablemente limiting of the norms that will regulate #some of the instruments related with the cohesion, but on these looks will pronounce  other members of my Group.
I go to conclude my intervention, gentleman President, but did not want to *acabarla without taking a call of attention on a fact that *me seems important: the modernisation of the fleet *pesquera is certainly important, the structural intervention is of big importance, but the development of the fishing, for our fleet, depends to a large extent of the existence of agreements international with third countries that allow to find *caladeros in the *cuales fish and develop the performance of this fleet.
In particular, has not modified neither the article 4 of the Treaty of the European Union, that converts to the Council (and, therefore, to the hierarchy of the different Councils) in the centre from #where promote  the politics of the Union, neither the article 202 of the Treaty *CE, that entrusts only to the Council the committed to determine the competitions of execution that will confer  to the Commission.
After having taken *alarde during the #german electoral campaign that with the rise to the power of the socialists #would change all and #would begin a path *modélico that #would create #a lot of places of work, investing the negative tendency that lives *Europa from takes at least a decade, did not take  initiative #any in this direction and neither debated  any proposal in favour of the development of the #european economy.
First of all it wanted to say to #all those colleagues that in January and February  *opusieron to the motion that created the Committee of Experts Independent thinking that it treated  of a species of hit of hand to sink it #everything through the creation of a committee, that think that now they give  account that  *equivocaron of plane so much of point of sight as of reasoning, and that, at least, #would have to withdraw #all the criticisms that took then to this dynamics undertaken, *me seems that positively, by the European Parliament, by #that that voted in favour of the creation of the Committee of Experts Independent.
In the European Union that day to day develops more his relations with third countries; politics that, as #all comprise, is connected with #some looks of the chapter on justice, security and freedom in *Europa, as, for example, the look of the immigration and the asylum. The Council of *Tampere is called also, *señorías, to confront the questions of the freedom, the security and the justice for the citizens in relation with the new realities that result of the new challenges that compose the step of the century *XX to the century *XXI.
Also it is true that the experiences of the past have carried to the Parliament to *desconfiar and to suspect that the reallocations of resources pertinent of budgetary lines no exhausted in the bottom are a practice *premeditada, since the budget always includes priorities of the Parliament that do not enjoy of #a lot of popularity and that the other institutions are not had to apply unconditionally.
The "#european letter of the fundamental rights" , that supposes  has to elaborate the European Council of *Tampere, will not be more that a group of words hollow #if it do not contains like minimum the total freedom of circulation and of installation for #all #that that reside and work in the European Union, #any one was his nationality of origin, #as well as the complete equality of rights, included the right of vote.
I believe that, in the first place, it recommends  aptly the foundation of an organisation, but that do not has to limit to the investigation of the seismic phenomenons and to the prevention of the earthquakes, that until the moment is scientifically impossible, #such as they ensure the *sismólogos, and #this #would have to know it our colleagues, that propose the creation of an institute for the prevention of earthquakes, but that it will have to indicate regulations and specifications of constructions *antisísmicas, of materials of construction adapted, etc., and will have to contribute to the best information of the #european citizens, loomed by the diverse calamities #as well as to that comport  adequately in #this.
But I believe that #all have to recognise, gentleman President, that have had five years of prolonged and tortuous negotiations on #all class of products: from the apples, the pears and the asparagus until the flowers, the fish, the wine, the port and the sherry, but now see that in his moment there will be an agreement and is to expect that the Monday  firm in *Sudáfrica.
Therefore I approve the amendments presented by the Mr. *Langen, to demand that the Commission exert a more active paper to end to boost a strategy of promotion coordinated in the breast of the States members and to develop the potential of *Europa in the field of the export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
#If it do not wishes to engage in this road, will correspond then to this Parliament go back to the strict application of the Treaty, article 272, and give the means - *algo that it #can take - so much in the field of the commitments as of the payments, to vote the credits to the height of the commitments that are the political commitments of the European Union and in the strict respect by the Treaty.
The *ECON also considers that it is an absolute priority the finance of measures on the taxation, because this sector follows being a field of irregularities in the inner market and, therefore, the line *B5-3001 on the application and the evolution of the inner market will have to keep in the level that has proposed the Commission in his project.
To my seem, in the decision of the Thursday happened also influenced the already registered descent and the *ulteriores reductions that expect  in the prices for the consumer in the sectors of the telecommunications, the electricity and the financial services, like result of the competition and the liberalisation of the markets, to the equal that the fall of the prices of the oil.
To part of the fact -and #this #can be *algo embarrassing- that virtually, in the Council of Government, never vote, so that never there #be at all that publish, do not go to repeat #all the arguments against of #this, the *cuales already have presented to the Parliament in previous occasions, but it is necessary to remember that the decisions of the Council of Government of the system of the Euro adopt  of collegiate form and therefore only it arises an only decision.
For *ello have set up a wide politics of State to struggle inside the frame of the law against the groups armed to the *margen of #this; to guarantee the security, protection, support and freedom of action for the defenders of the human rights; to attend to the persons displaced by the violence; to adopt the legal instruments that protect the human rights and strengthen our device of justice.
Another point has been the adoption of measures concrete in relation to the fight against the crime organised, as, for example, a greater operative competition for the *Europol, an Academy of Police European or measures more strict against the wash of money and the cooperation with the countries candidates, as with frequency are the countries origin of the crime organised.
*Segunda Contradiction: the Council of *Tampere announces the platonic will to administer the migratory currents and struggle against the immigration *clandestina in the origin, but to #the same time proclaims firmly, in varied occasions, that it is necessary to concede to the legal immigrants -quote- "a group of rights uniform so next as it was possible to the of the citizens of the Union" and that has to apply  *prioritariamente a politics of integration that *les allow to remain.
Already it is more that hour to act in the level of the Council and of the Commission and -*me *atrevo to say it like conclusion of my intervention- of *ello depends, of course, the coherence of our societies, the social peace, the own survival of the #european idea, but also the very understood interest of the company in his *globalidad and, therefore, the solidity of the #european economy.
In the last years, included the #spanish democratic stage, have known varied situations #where the fishing always has been a pending subject among the parts by the subject of the existent dispute to the hour to define our territorial waters in relation to the #african neighbouring villages.
Memory that, with occasion of the negotiation of the Agreement of fishing that now expires, the Group of Left Unitary European  *opuso to that got  to the signature of the Agreement *pesquero by means of the granting of contingents additional for the import of fruits and vegetables in the frame of the parallel negotiation of the Agreement of association.
On the one hand, there #be the need of *sustanciar the same existence of the European Union converting in effective in #all the States members the application of the decisions taken in the competent instances in the matters of competition community and, in particular, in the cases like the tackled, susceptible to invalidate #one of the fundamental suppositions of the Union, is to say, the free circulation of commodities.
Goals that, in accordance with the strategy of the great orientations of economic politics, are not another thing that achieve facilitate the goal of stability of the monetary politics by means of some budgetary measures and an evolution *salarial suitable and more favourable, in these conditions, to the growth and to the employment, included the types of change and the types of interest on a long-term basis.
In the agenda of morning appears the debate of the question of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi on the strategy for the realisation of the only market European and the past week examine in *Estrasburgo the possibilities to deepen and consolidate the dialogue *macroeconómico with the Parliament, in the context of the debate of the report of the #ECB.
From this point of sight, of the dialogue *macroeconómico with the representatives of the *empleadores and of the workers, it only that it #can go out well is the adaptation of the collective negotiations and the readjustment of the wages to the requirements of the financial capital, of the euro and of the predominant economic politics that sees  expressed in the *UEM and in the pact of stability.
Gentleman President, *me seems that the #many things that have said  #can schematise  of the following mood: or the dialogue *macroeconómico is a pure hypocrisy for *paliar the fault of a true economic politics for the Union, and then it that said the other colleagues is totally useless, a calque and a loss of #time; or well the dialogue *macroeconómico is *algo true, substantial, and then there #be hypocrisy by the #another side, is to say, tries  hide with words *insustanciales a danger that, in my opinion, evolves to the *dirigismo in the #european economy.
Certainly it is to appreciate that it recognise  the fundamental paper of the school to win the unemployment, without embargo, lacking any reference to the need that the school act in the field of a global territorial planning that see the participation of the social speakers, the local entities and the business world.
Wish, in particular, take #some observations on the reasons that *me have carried to vote in favour of the strategy for the inner market, but before taking it, *permítanme say also that have voted against in the question of procedure to postpone the vote on the subject of the fishing, because *me will be of the all impossible assist to *Estrasburgo inside two weeks and #would have wished enormously express my solidarity with the fishermen to the part of *Escocia, in particular, with #that of the islands and zones separated.
The European Parliament and the Council buy to very low price his tranquility of consciousness, because in addition to the private violence and of the relative to the sexual exploitation, it is necessary to recognise the increase of the social violence, that results of the aggravation of the poverty and of the intensification of the misfortune in the popular classes.
The insistence in the need to influence on the reflections of the population and the habits of consumption and to establish currents of communication with the citizens and the small and medium enterprises confirms the importance that will have the political leadership on the change of our habits of consumption and the promotion of a sustainable development.
The resolution of the Parliament *nos remembers to #all the external dimension, #this is, the process of enlargement and the relations with third countries, especially with the countries in roads of development; *nos invites to adopt a realistic approach, balanced and flexible in the preparation of politics, look especially important to the hour to examine the energetic combination and his evolution in the time.
And, finally, in relation with the amendment *nº 19, comprise the sense of the proposal, but signal to the attention of His *Señorías that the relative norm to the translation of the decisions do not fits in a regulation on competition, recognition and execution of judicial decisions: the own place for the norm on translations is the directive on the transmission of the acts, the #another instrument that today debate and in the that it establishes  precisely his possibility of translation.
In my quality of speaker of opinion of the Commission of Subjects External for the report on the actions in the nuclear sector in favour of the *PECOS and of the new independent States, approved by unanimity on 27 October of the past year, have underlined the capital importance of the security *considerándola a requirement for the adhesion to the Union of new States members.
The Council of the Union, in his Common Action of 24 February 1997 relative to the action against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of boys, requests to the States members that proceed to a review of the legislation and of the procedures in vigour in these spheres to end to watch by that the types of behaviour mentioned are object of effective penal sanctions.
Gentleman President, is a question that arouse to the protect of the section 2 of the article 112 of the Regulation in relation with an appeal of statement of procedure of urgency that have presented three hours ago regarding the Report *Napolitano in application of the article 115 of the Regulation, so that it announce  to the Assembly the presentation of this appeal of debate of urgency and proceed  in consequence, so as to that we #can respect the terms of debate and vote that fix when elaborating the agenda.
Therefore, to respect the Regulation of this Assembly and the Regulation by the that they govern  the deputies, to guarantee that the deputies enjoy of the rights that *les awards said Regulation, the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, with support, as it announced  before, of the Group *PEE, requested the postponement to guarantee that *nos adjusted to the article 112 of our Regulation on the application of the procedure of urgency.
It #would be the #willing #finnish Presidency to recognise that they still have to celebrate varied meetings of the Council before it finalise his Presidency and that it #can *utilizarlas like a very useful precedent to establish his *credenciales in terms of opening - *algo that, *me fear, do not exists in these moments - guaranteeing like minimum that *cuando publish  the communiqués of press at the end of the meetings of the Council, said communiqués of press collect exactly the sense of the vote of each country on each #one of the subjects subjected to vote?
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0059/1999) of the Mr. *Pirker, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the proposal of regulation (*CE) of the Council (*COM(1999) 260 - *C­0082/1999 - 1999/0116(*CNS)) relative to the creation of the system "*EURODAC" for the comparison of the digital prints of the applicants of asylum and other foreigners.
Regarding the enlargement of the *OMC so that it include also the investments, volume notes with satisfaction that the European Parliament has manifested  *fírmemente #one and another time in the sense that it do not is necessary to repeat the errors of *AMI, that the responsibilities of the investors according to the guidelines of the *OIT and of the *OCDE have to define to #the same time that the right of the investors, and that -by a clear majority- it is necessary to establish a European Code of Behaviour for companies multinationals (amendment 15).
4) in accordance with the positions that always have defended in this Parliament, on purpose of the review of the Treaties of *Maastricht and of *Amsterdam, in the sense to keep consecrated the historical balance founder among great and small States, #can not approve this resolution that opens the "box of #Pandora" for a Treaty that accepts like just the supremacy of some States on #others, in comparison with the principle of equality among #all the #european citizens.
I know well that the alcohol produces dependency and also that there are persons that dies owing to the abuse of alcohol, without embargo, there #be a fundamental difference in the case of these substances, because in the majority of the cases to the persons *le results possible to control his consumption of tobacco and alcohol in a different measure to the that *les is possible to the immersed youngsters in the abuse of drugs.
In general lines, also is favourable the trial on the strength of intervention fast of the European Union, although there #be had #some #discordant voices regarding this matter, as it always has *sucedido in the history no only of the European Parliament, but of #a lot of national Parliaments, *cuando treats  of problems that in some mood *atañen to military looks, that #can  or #can not  talk of a #european army.
Recently the Court has confirmed that, although a Been member authorise the games of chance, #the same has the faculty to put limits to the offer gave said games and *ello in consideration to the goals of interest public like the control of the wish to play, the prevention of the frauds or of the offences and the employment of the benefits obtained for ends of public interest.
*Me #Would enjoy to know #if the Commissioner #would suit in that the two last deputies that have asked to the Commission the adoption of measures #would take better in asking to the leader of his own party, Mr. *Blair, that reduce the very high level of the pound -kept in a level too much #alto by the high types of interests of the Realm Joined- to a realistic level and also achieve that the Mr. *Blair initiate the campaign to adhere  to the euro, with it that there #would be greater transparency.
Therefore, to the sight of the previous experiences and also of the statement of today, *yo want to direct a very clear warning to the Council: #if for the spring has not reached  a satisfactory solution for the programs *plurianuales bear *Kosovo and the *Balcanes western, accompanied of the corresponding commitment of the Council, will have to manoeuvre in waters very difficult in the frame of the budgetary procedure of the year 2001.
It is true that, in the #european budget, acts  worse *cuando carries  out of the #european continent: 10 millions of euros for #Asia central, 14 millions and half for the populations *desarraigadas of *América #latin, 4 millions for the human rights in *África *austral and in *Timor, etc. *Eso #would be well #if, during this time, did not consider  the possibility to reduce in 5 millions of euros the credits in favour of our beekeepers, by true, to the that take the competition the imports of honey adulterated of the foreigner.
#One of the advances achieved in the meeting of the Monday of the Council of Environment is the adoption of a common posture by part of the Council, in relation with the strategic Managerial call of evaluation of repercussions in the environment, the *cual offers a splendid instrument to evaluate the effects in the environment of different programs and activities, included the effects of the atmospheric broadcasts.
The Committee of conciliation has got likewise to a commitment according to the *cual the program *Socrates will contribute to the development of a "#european dimension of the education and of the training" , in place of "an educational space European" , as it had asked the Parliament, or of "an educational cooperation" , formulation of character feebler, that the Council had preferred to the principle.
It That has put  in *entredicho is not the existence of norms #tending to organise the international trade or the own existence of a world-wide organisation of the trade, but the fact that the *OMC pretends to be the source of #all normative, the referee of #all the things, the supreme judge of the future world.
According to the rules of the external politics and of common defence, according to the *cual the States members coordinate, after all, his performance in the international organisations, the initiative and the power of decision are totally in hands of the Council, in the practice, in hands of a group of civil servants skilled that have a natural tendency to concentrate  in his own problems.
By #everything *ello, in the 50º anniversary of the Agreements of Gin, and *cuando owe *comprometernos #all -the Parliament, the Commission and the Council- to boost the knowledge of the humanitarian international Right and support to the organisations that have like responsibility his defence,  *le occurs to the Council #any concrete initiative to spread the humanitarian international Right among the citizens of the Union?
#If the Mr. deputy to the Parliament wants to know more of the real conditions of the transport of animals or wants to put the subject in knowledge of the Commission, perhaps was convenient that *le formulate the question directly to the Commission, since it is specific task of the Commission control the fulfillment of the disposals of the valid Directives or take part in the subject *cuando the disposals are not fulfilled.
Improve the small and medium enterprises and favour measures that contribute to improve his competitiveness has been #one of the goals of this Parliament by the fundamental paper that exert in the creation of employment and for considering that #any one actions oriented to the small and average economic operators boost the economic growth European in general and signal a safe path to reach the economic and social cohesion of the Community.
#If well the current normative capacity in the frame of the European Union did not allows still the adoption of a legal diet *transfronterizo in this field, expect that in a future #this was possible, especially after the Ministers of Culture of *Austria and *Alemania, in February of the past year, considered that this question, in what #such, *reviste a character *transfronterizo and like this have manifested it by writing.
I believe that it is very important that explain that the terrible rapes of the human rights, like the that have lived and live in #Sierra Lion, are *algo that to *nosotros like Europeans *nos *incumbe, because according to our conception the human rights and the human dignity are indivisible all over the world and because we are not had to tolerate this selective conception that conducts to that we allow that the acts of violence that produce  in our vicinities *nos seem more conclusive that the eruptions of violence, like the that witness in #Sierra Lion from takes #a lot of years.
Like this as, in spite of the disappointment that *me produces the fact that the President in exercise was trying to reach an agreement among the two States members, #this is beyond all doubt a field in the that the Council #can adopt positive measures attending to his worry by the human rights and respecting the norms of an institution that, #if well it did not forms part of the EU, yes has his respect and remains mentioned in a part of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Anyway I want to take advantage of also this opportunity to appreciate of heart to the Parliament, especially to the speakers and to #all the that have shown a big interest or that have been involved in the debate of the process of enlargement, for having given spirit #one and another time to the Commission so that it took also his own initiatives with the end of *salvaguardar the good rhythm of the process of the enlargement.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted to say in the first place that the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary  *congratula of the presentation of these two directives because the enlargement to entities no banking of the broadcast of money electronic *nos seems a fine measure to increase the competition in this matter and, therefore, improve the quality of the service loaned and the prices that will earn  to the consumers.
It treats  of the problem -and the problem is only east- of the minimum prudential norms that, ensuring the stability and the solidity of the entities of money electronic, open the path to the mutual recognition of the permission and the supervision and, through this road, to the free circulation of the operators and of the services.
#This #can seem dared regarding some definitions that appear in the national public rights, but had account at the same time of the urgency that exists and of the pressure of the Council by that respect  the terms established -have some calendars-, is indispensable to continue the work, and *nos satisfies the request formulated in this sense, especially because have in front of our Assembly to a commissioner that has shown that dominated perfectly these questions, that knew to listen it that asks the Parliament and that has authority in front of the governments and, specifically, to the Council *ECOFIN.
The Group *Europa of the Nations has presented six amendments that clear the principle of prevention, that expand the of sanitary security of the alimentary products, including the organisms modified genetically, the phytosanitary products or the hormones used like factor of growth, #as well as the prohibition to use pertinent meats of the slaughterhouses or bones of animals for the manufacture of flour animal.
In this sense, this crisis, that began with the approval or no approval of the management for 1996 and of the continuation for 1997, concerning the *cual neither recommend any approval of the management in this week but a postponement of the approval of the management, has been a necessary crisis to extract of here the positive approaches that *nos #would enjoy to have taken get still, gentleman *Liikanen, to this Commission.
Our Group has been coherent in his position; graces also to the *tozudez or to the rigour of our speaker, the Mr. *Elles, #all the Plenary has followed at the end this approach, and today register a hit that in principle only have to appreciate it to a person, in concrete, to the speaker, the Mr. *Elles, by his report on the approval of the management of the budget 1996.
The nomination of the Roman Mr. *Prodi in the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of *Berlín was the *primer step. The Bosses of State and of Government have shown with the designation of the Mr. *Prodi the capacity of performance of the European Union and his determination to resolve of fast way and *convincente the crisis occurred.
In his intervention has mentioned *usted almost #all the key words for the next five years: the agriculture and the cities, the competition and it social, the youth, the greater persons, the anonymous societies, the small and medium enterprises, the protection of the consumer and the liberalisation, the enlargement and the relation with States Joined.
The that we have voted in favour of the proposal of the Council obeys to the fact that the present majority in this Parliament will follow earning in the practice 1.000 euros by a trip that costs 400 crowns, for example, and *nosotros want to give priority to the process of renewal and cleansing regarding the *viáticos before that to our opposition to some labour conditions and *retributivas common, taking special emphasis in this point in the need that it was possible to tax the community wage nationally.
To the contrary that some fears that have expressed , seems that *Europa is closing rows in front of the crisis and that the processes of integration are winning inwardly and also *exteriormente a new dynamic, simply because the #european alternatives #can see  better that never in this time of #crisis. On the one hand, the alternative that represents this Parliament, the *Europa of the integration, that means #one *Europa in peace, with stability and welfare and, on the other hand, the old image of *Europa that find in the wars of the *Balcanes: nationalism with the consequence of wars, trips and misfortune.
Regarding the amendments 3 and 4, the Commission has approved a conjoint statement in the Regulation according to the *cual, the Commission will provide #all the oral information to the Council and to the Parliament on the economic situation of the countries *beneficiarios that receive loans, #as well as on the risks that have explained to the hour to present the annual report.
It is #this the main protest, the most vehement protest, that *les transmit by part of the commission. And in name of #the same urge to the Presidency of the Council to that it promote a culture of collaboration with the radically new Parliament in a field #where the state authority and the power on the rights of the citizens and the fundamental rights leave  feel with special virulence.
The #one of May, the Council decided by means of procedure written integrate to the personnel of the Secretariat of *Schengen in the General Secretariat of the Council. I expect that like this we reach to put final point to the debates on this subject that have come  *sucediendo lately and that the Presidency, the States members and also the personnel of the Secretariat of the Council #can go back to concentrate  fully in the work that *nos awaits in these two last months of the #german Presidency.
We have to achieve a balance among the civil freedoms, the freedom of expression, the freedom of the persons to put in Internet it that they want to, without more *entrometimiento official of it that there #would be in the postal services or in the telephone, and *contrapesar the #another argument that the companies do not have why find with persons that *infrinjan the rights of property intellectual, that *infrinjan his logos and pretend to be a company that are not.
Although in the immediately back period to the resignation of the president *Suharto there was great hopes that at last it #would remain opened the path to a peaceful solution of the problems of *Timor Oriental, after a chamber of century of *derramamiento of blood in the that has died a third part of the population like consequence of the #indonesian invasion of 1975, those hopes have not fulfilled .
Gentleman President, the security of the existent nuclear plants and of the that are building , represents a goal *prioritario in front of the perspective of the adhesion, #such as they have highlighted in reiterated occasions the Parliament and the Commission with occasion of the relative package to the Diary 2000, #as well as the Council in the field of the nuclear security with regard to the future enlargements of our Union.
The strict fulfillment of the norms of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade and of the Agreement on the Textile, in particular the calendar of the liberalisation, the control of the *dumping and the fraudulent practices, the access to the market of third countries and the limitation of the bilateral agreements, will have to constitute requirements *ineludibles of the European Union.
I am not *yo the one who has to *recordarle that #this *Europa has 20 millions of unemployed -the unemployment is a problem that mine his social cohesion-, that #this *Europa is in *entredicho in the conquests of civilisation made like the of the welfare, by politics *neoliberales, these same politics *neoliberales of the *cuales *usted has *ensalzado the *ulterior need of flexibility in his previous speeches and that, by the contrary, has supposed a decrease of the quality of the work and of the quality of life, to difference of it that proposes for the future.
The fault of the Mr. *Bangemann consists in having taken patent this basically corrupt system, so that any #european voter #can see it and in consequence prefer to remain home the day of the elections, as it already took the majority the days 10, 11, 12 and 13 June depriving of this form to this assembly of any type of legitimacy democratic.
Obviously, #this is not the opinion of my Group, neither neither the opinion of the Committee of Experts, that in the chapter 7 declares *pertinentemente that the distinction in the breast of the Commission among politics and management is not *defendible, quote, neither *jurídicamente neither in the practice, that this distinction allows to skew the political responsibilities, that it logical is that it was deleted in benefit of the hierarchical subordination regarding the politically responsible commissioners.
*Usted *nos Has presented in the person of the Mrs. *Schreyer to a politics experienced that it still will need a shooting in #any that another subject of field #european, since first it will have to  adapt to #some moods of operation, but that has put  to the day quickly and of exhaustive way on the very complex subject of the budgetary politics and that it is very conscious of the future challenges in this field.
Gentleman President of the European Commission, #would wish to begin in the point in that it has remained  the Mr. *Donnelly, the *segunda splits of his mission, the program of work, because I believe that, more that of the collective or individual responsibilities, that, of course, consider also important subject, the work of restoration of the prestige and of the creativity of the European Commission depends especially of the program of work.
I have to say that so much to the pensioners that *me have commanded to this seat number 270 of the European Parliament, as to me *nos has satisfied the comment of the Commissioner designated Mrs. #Anna *Diamantopulu that, when answering to #one of my questions during the auditions -with regard to the *cuales it is necessary to remember so much it that it was very as it that - did not answer that has very in account the problem of the greater persons that expect a pension and that the fifteen States members no longer is in situation to pay, since the Insurances are feeble and have deficit.
To his time, at all has advanced  on the need of *imposición public prosecutor to the movements of capitals, regarding the need of adaptation of the national social diets to the current demographic tendencies, it that shows that, to end of accounts, the goal is not a greater social justice, but, to the contrary, #one *agravación of the social inequalities.
I request that the institutions of the European Union support the sending *urgentísimo of a strong civil mission and of a strength of security of the Nations Joined, of proportional dimension to the gravity of the situation, to achieve that *Timor constitute  like independent State, it that will demand long along the *cual the Nations Joined will have to keep an unambiguous support and the European Union a help *apolítica and economic indispensable.
The *segunda is the following: I Want to take an urgent appeal to our European Parliament so that, when talking of the #indonesian question, take a clear distinction among the military diet of Indonesian, the elections that celebrated  and that they were a reflection of a long and deep process of transformation that only finishes to begin in an enormous empire of the that *Timor Oriental is not more that a small fragment, and the big suffering of the #indonesian village.
The concealment of a common pit in the that *yacían the bodies of 15 #serbian murdered around the middle of July in the outskirts of *Gnjilane, zone under responsibility of the #american troops, poses serious *interrogantes around the paper of the call *Afuerza of peace@, since in function of his tolerance or support, the #serbian population of *Kosovo is victim of an extended ethnic cleansing that shows the difference of sensitivity of the international community about the protection of the human rights, that gives  by safe.
Without embargo, regarding the composition of the council of direction of the agency, do not comprise the reasons that #would have to induce to the Parliament to foresee the nomination of seven independent experts only by part of the Commission and #this against of the proposals formulated by the own Commission that, in dissonance with the Committee attach to #the same, has foreseen, by the contrary, the presence of a representative of each #one of the States members.
In the section 3, the European Parliament demands "an open and innovative approach on the character of the Letter, the nature of the rights that will have to appear in *ella, #as well as on the paper and the position of #this in the constitutional evolution of the Union" , it that shows his will of not to limit, simply, to collect the rights in vigour, as it asked the Council.
A fraudulent escape of the money of help foreign, a flight of capital #russian in the last ten years estimated among the 150.000 and 300.000 millions of dollars and a #russian economy that has gone back to the trade of barter *nos prevent to have really contrives of the *envergadura of the financial crisis in the Russian Federation.
Lady Speaker, in my opinion the Parliament #would not have to leave without taking advantage of the opportunity to take a statement on the mandate in the turn of the *WTO, because the Council of Ministers will give the mandate to the Commission on 13 October and #would be really a pity #if this mandate awarded  without knowing it that thinks the Parliament of *Europa on the subject.
Of course, it results ironic, as we said yesterday in the Commission of Development, that the Commission of Budgets voted the past week to reduce the budgetary line on the attention of the reproductive health and the work in matter of *HIV/AIDS to the half -of 25 millions to 12 millions of euros- and that now are examining the need of investment in this sector.
Therefore, welcome are the campaigns of information oriented to sensitise to the public opinion on the subjects related with the energetic saving, without embargo, do not see how the adoption of measures legislative excessively strict #can be the most effective method to improve the energetic intensity of the final demand.
Consistently with his obligation to defend the interests of his States members; consistently with the values of equity and social progress that proclaim like #ours; consistently with the project of world that want to contribute to build, more balanced and more *solidario; but consistently also with the performance kept by #many of *nosotros and #many of our compatriots in *Europa during four decades *esforzándonos for finishing with the apartheid and dreaming with the instauration in *Sudáfrica of a diet of freedom and of dignity for #all the #south african.
Our new Parliament sends today a new and clear signal of forceful -support and sustained- to a process of peace that goes to open the path to the progress, the democracy, the respect to the human rights and the hope in the future for #all the villages of the region and for the peaceful coexistence among #Israel and the independent state of Palestinian.
We have to respect these measures, because of another mood will be encouraging of *facto the politics of colonisation, and *eso that the European Union, together with the rest of the International Community, States Joined included, always have condemned this politics and #all know that the #israeli politics of settlements constitutes a big obstacle in the long path to the peace and to an authentic #palestinian State.
So that in this occasion the road of hope that opens  after the signature of *Sharm The-*Sheikh do not remain again closed in the future, is necessary that the sensitivity and the political intelligence of the new ruling of the State of #Israel, #whose security want guaranteed, promote able measures to create a confidence sustained in the #palestinian part, so that the peaceful road, recently reopened, scope, it before possible, the dip definite.
Regarding the external politics, believe that it is necessary to insist in the fact that no only have commercial commitments, but that are linked by agreements *multilaterales on the environment, by relative international agreements to the respect of the human rights, and in my opinion -that create share #a lot of colleagues-, these commitments have at the same time in the ethical plane and in the political plane a more important value that the *librecambio.
Anyway, I have to say that the negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium do not have to prejudice the essential elements of the agricultural model European neither the necessary reforms so that, in addition to it agreed in the Diary 2000, protect  the internal development of the territories of the goal 1 with familiar exploitations based in the earth, in front of the interests of the great industrial companies and of big distribution.
To me *me #would enjoy to ask to the Council, that no to the Commission, how values in general lines the development of this campaign; #if it is truth that #this has been a good year for the tuna and #if therefore they have averted  the conflicts among the distinct fleets that fish in the *Cantábrico; how number of ships has reduced each country like consequence of the moratorium; #if this method is revealing  as valid to brake the pressure on the populations of tuna.
Regarding the question of the assignments for the structural measures, the divergences among the Council and the Parliament  summary in two points: in the first place, the amount of the advance of the relative payment to the new structural actions and, second, the calendar of the settlement of the ancient permissions that still have not paid .
Since a big part of the community budget executes  by means of the States members, *yo *le #would recommend sincerely to the Council that watch by the efficiency, the transparency and a clean execution in this field, so that the Commission do not go back to see  forced to follow resorting in the future to the procedure of approval of the management in interest of a clean execution of the budget.
*Yo Want to express, therefore, first of all my *congratulaciones and my gratitude to the Monetary Institute European, to the national banks, to the Central Bank European, represented today here by his President, Mr. *Duisenberg, but likewise to the States members, that promoted through numerous necessary political reforms the *ulteriores structural and institutional reforms and fulfilled the criteria of convergence, and also to the citizens, that are supporting with an increasing consensus this necessary step to the #european integration
Our Group receives with satisfaction the training of an organ for the preparation of the Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in the belief that the wide parliamentary scope of his composition reflects the realisation of the process of democratisation of the better EU that the usual Conference *Intergubernamental.
They remain, without embargo, two obstacles: firstly, the abandonment of the community preference in the agricultural field, and already know the problems that exist in the sectors of the tomato, or of the horticulture; and, the second point, with regard to the *cual #can not yield, #would consist in an exchange of the right of fishing for the Spaniards by a supplement of immigration, in #one *Europa that has 18 millions of unemployed.
By it that refers  to the report *Cunha on the celebration of a new Protocol by the that they fix  the possibilities of fishing and the financial compensation, foreseen in the Agreement with the Republic of *Angola for the period comprised among 3 May 1999 and on 2 May of the 2000, wanted to signal that it treats  of a classical protocol, that makes possible the access to the resources *pesqueros during a period determined and fixed #one *contrapartida financial.
With my innocence and naivety, *yo had thought that, *cuando the Managerial Committee Scientist gathered  the past week and took his announcement -in fact, took it the Mr. *Pascale, French *él, like President of said Committee-, in the that indicated the unanimous approval of said committee, in the sense that the meat of bovine British is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of the EU or possibly more that #any of the world, already had got  to the top of the pyramid.
Gentleman President, wanted to congratulate to the speaker Mr. *Hughes, regarding the ordination of the time of work of the persons of the sea, by his proposal to the Parliament to approve, without modifications, the common position of the Council with regard to the application of the labour day of the persons of the sea on board of the ships that use community ports.
Also I expect that the procedure by the that *nos have seen forced to examine the present Communication in the Parliament do not take  like model for the future, since it also has been the cause, gentleman colleague *Lehne, that we have not had the opportunity to debate the amendments in commission and *nos to forced to proceed of a very atypical way for this House.
But a true social support to the goals that determine  with the persons in difficulty in the frame of procedures formalised is the only mood that the helps and incentives for the research of employment *surtan #all his effects, no only in the own access to the employment, but also in *algo that is intimately associated to #this, is to say, the *reinserción durable of some persons that are totally #wear# out by the destructive process of the unemployment.
We consider important that carry out in the stage of programming to allow to the workers anticipate the change, expand the field of application of the directive and guarantee that #the same contain minimum prescriptions to scale community that #can not break but in the most favourable sense for the workers, #as well as extend the content to the matters that affect directly to the rights of the workers and his future.
This strategic option referred , first of all, to the approval of the directive on the #european company and afterwards to the approval of the directive on the query and the information; and all #this in the logical that #if had priority the directive on the that are debating, #would be *complicadísima the vote of the directive on the employment that, as well they know, carries in the table of negotiations more of 14 years.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, agrees with my considerations that with the proposal that *usted takes, practically suspend  the obligations of the Council derived of the compulsory credits but that keep  his rights, to know, the reduction of the credits no employees, and that in this way happen in fact of the compulsory credits to the no compulsory without that the Parliament obtain the rights of sovereignty on this sector in the budget?
In the breast of the Western European Union, the subject of the guarantee of defence mutual has even more forces that in the breast of the NATO; in the neutral countries, the general opinion in these moments is that the commitment of defence mutual is not applicable.
And as I have heard to say to the gentleman *Bourlanges in the debate that the next Conference *Intergubernamental #would have to decide the creation of a #european tax, *yo #would say, to the contrary, in name of the Group *Europa of the Nations, that #if the *CIG has to treat this problem, is precise to decide the creation of a clear system, transparent, *equitativo and, especially, controlled closely by the national democracies, *me refer of an annual contribution of the States based in a percentage of his *PNB identical for #all.

The position initial negotiator of the European Union, ambitious in his goals, is allocated to not going out strengthened of a cycle of negotiations that #can *eternizarse and stagnate to cause, in particular, of the predictable attitude of the States Joined, that will try constantly destroy the unit of this mandate that possesses the Mr. *Lamy, and that do not represents more that an apparent unit, unable to dissemble the divergences of interests among the Fifteen.
The only solution is to reestablish the controls in the inner borders of the Community; to endow to the services of police of the States members with the human means, financial and materials to fulfil his mission of protection of the persons honoured; renounce to award to the irresponsible of *Bruselas any type of competitions in police matter, judicial and of entrance and permanence of foreigners.
The situation of retard aggravated by the vindictive destruction *perpetrada by the strengths armed #indonesian, the small dimensions of the territory, associated to the circumstance that there #be another half of the island, the coexistence with neighbours and powerful interests, the nonexistence of an administration, are elements that contribute to the complexity of the task and give idea of it necessary that it is the participation of the *timorenses and it important that is the international solidarity.
We will loan our full support to the responsible of Nations Joined, the Mr. *Kouchner, and his ancient colleagues, *cuando at last begin to set up an administration in *Kosovo in place to leave this committed in hands of the false and illegitimate Government of the *ELK, *cuando the municipal authorities and the city councils of the villages and of the cities leave to be governed by the *ELK, *cuando these tasks and other #many that remain for taking in *Kosovo are carried to good term, #if no by other #Kosovar, by other agents of Nations Joined.

Gentleman President, have taken the word to show first of all my surprise after having listened it that *nos has declared the Speaker in exercise of the Council regarding the Conference *Intergubernamental. The Mrs. *Halonen not even has quoted the resolution of the European Parliament of 18 November and the proposals contained in #the same referents to the diary of the Conference.
Economic problems, problems of human rights, of democracy, of respect to the minorities. Problems, in end, of security and stability in the *sureste of *Europa, by what *Turquía bases his external politics well in the violence declared, as in the case of *Chipre with the prolonged occupation of the north of the island, well in the threat to use the violence, as *cuando the #turkish Parliament declares officially *casus *belli the exercise of the #greek rights of sovereignty on the territorial waters of the *Egeo.
In fact, the liberalisation of the market, the cancellation of the subventions, the impunity of the investments, the commercialisation of the services, even of the education, of the health and of the culture are loaning service to the great interests of the capital *monopolístico to increase his benefits; without embargo, are not at all appeals for the workers neither for the villages.
Here it is precise rather play in the future a preparatory paper more intelligent and more marked to end to take patent how interests represent really in common in these world-wide rounds and why the need: in concrete, to control the globalisation, to contain the spontaneous growth that, in any case, #would produce  without the world-wide round, and to carry out here an intelligent strategy of solution of the global problems.
Already I have underlined the importance that the Commission assume also his responsibility regarding the States members, but *cuando treats  of internal politics, the external help and the administration of the personnel, #can impose requirements clearer to the Commission and #can also tackle the subject of way different *cuando treats  of the Statement of reliability, *algo that have begun to take and that will follow taking.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0097/1999) of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the delegation of the European Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the conjoint text, approved by the Committee of Conciliation, of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  the *segunda stage of the program of action community in matter of education *SOCRATES (*C5-0267/1999 - 1998/0195(*COD)).
As a result of the queries that have made to the Common Centre of Investigation and to the States members in particular, have got to the conclusion that the 1% is the commitment that better fulfils two purposes: in the first place, the goal to establish a level of tolerance very low that involve the effort of the operators; and second, that take into account the necessary feasibility in #all the chain of production.
In the first place, it wanted to *decirle that his small delay is perfectly justified by the importance of his communication and also that the Parliament  *congratula that it was possible this form of debate practically immediate and instantaneous among this Assembly and the Executive and takes votes by that this new method get for real to create a space of debate political current, that by strength has to *enaltecer to this Assembly and his relations with the Commission.
In the first place, it wanted to say to His *Señoría that share the worry that finishes to express concerning that the #european institutions in his group are able to formulate a politics of information and of communication that allow to take get to #all the #european citizens no only the tenor of the debates, but also the value added that for his daily life have the decisions of the Parliament, of the Commission and of the own Council.
As it planned, will be necessary *ponderar the actions in relation with the civil situation, economic and social of the distinct New Independent States and of *Mongolia using two parameters: the solution to the problem of the destitution and of the social and economic marginalisation, without privileges and graduations, and the evaluation of the civil strategic value, economic and social with regard to *acercar the villages of the New Independent States and *Mongolia to the European Union.
The European Union has to take all it that was in his hand during the next year so that they find  the most efficient solutions possible from the point of sight environmental and of the reduction of broadcasts, solutions that was possible to approve at length, with the end to get to an agreement on the rule of the mechanisms of *Kioto and of the application of the Agreement.
#This is it that #would have wanted to say to the Mr. #Martin, #if #this, of a way that estimate little *cortés and little according to the requirements of the democracy, to the respect of the right of the minorities and to the parliamentary habit, had not decided from the principle, without at least *haberme listened, that the observation that *yo thought to take regarding the articles 180 and 181 of our Regulation was not a statutory question.
*Nos Find in a back procedure to the decision of 1997 and it more #likely is that we go back to *encontrarnos in a back procedure to the current decision. Without embargo, by the sake of the consumer #would have to have elaborated previous query to the Parliament a plan of work to guarantee a correct application of the system of identification compulsory inside the term established.
In spite of the previous resolutions of the Parliament, supported in the report of the International Federation of Human Rights -that confirms the precariousness of the conditions of arrest of the political prisoners-, the maltreatments, the humiliations, the attacks to the physical integrity of the individuals, are common coin in the prisons of *Djibouti, especially in the of *Gabode.
Regarding the exclusion of Party Popular Democratic of the elections, the gentleman deputy definitely will know that the Constitutional Court Turkish refused unanimously on 8 March 1999 the appeal of the Fiscal General of the State on the provisional decision for the prohibition of the participation of this Party.
Up to now, and although the *PE has requested it clearly, these purposes have not materialised  from the point of sight operative in a program integrated for the insular regions of the EU, #where live 14 millions of citizens of 12 States members, so as to that they #can compete in the market in conditions *equitativas with the other continental regions that do not suffer from the principle of the derivative geographic disadvantage of the *insularidad.
I am in favour without place to doubts of the enlargement to these new countries, but fear that, given the situation of the financial perspectives and for being these less rich countries that the current members of the Union, stress  the *perifericidad and the eccentricity of some regions like *Galicia and *Portugal with the decreases of the structural Bottoms, with it that will hamper  the necessary economic cohesion and social #european.
So much more I express our hopes -and #can not hide my worry to the *respecto- that it #can go back to study  thoroughly the Law of the language and the Law of elections parliamentary and municipal, that were approved after the publication of our last report, since these laws, according to a first #ours impression, #can go in in conflict with the international norms in this field.
Since, in virtue of the article 255, to the Commission *le corresponds the task to elaborate a relative legislative proposal to the general principles and to the limits that regulate the exercise of said right, our Institution will present in useful time his proposal to the *respecto and the Plenary will have like this the possibility to manifest his position in the procedure of *codecisión.
The posture adopted so much by the Commission as by our economic commission is more *matizada: while the stability of prices keep  and was guaranteed, #can *permitirnos a monetary politics more flexible, to condition of course that it keep  and consolidate  the budgetary discipline; sure enough, by fault of the enormous debt accumulated and of the important resources consecrated to the service of said debt and to the finance of the deficit, have had to reduce during years the productive private investments.
Regarding the most concrete proposal, face to #many of His *Señorías, on the tax reduced of the VAT of the services with high index of hand of drama, have #a lot of taste in observing that today, with the #german Presidency, has celebrated  the first meeting of a group of work of the Council on this subject and tonight go to debate the Report *Thyssen also on this subject.
The agenda signals  the report (To4-0207/99), of the Mrs. *Thyssen, in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, on the proposal of directive of the Council to modify the directive 77/388/*CEE regarding the possibility to apply to experimental title a type reduced of VAT to the services that apply hand of drama of intensive way (*COM(99)0062 - *C4-0169/99-99/0056 (*CNS).
Certainly, gentleman President, *usted today has remembered the need of an ecological tax to face up to the challenges that poses, for example, the climatic change -and #this *me satisfies- and has talked of sustainable development, without embargo, how not highlighting the contradiction among these affirmations and his exaggerated confidence in the results that will derive  of the full liberalisation of the commercial exchanges in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade?
The 112 or 115 deputies that have voted in favour of these amendments honour with *ello to our Parliament, because they express the conviction that the Parliament is in his right to control to the Commission, control the execution of the community budget by the Commission, and that #this has the duty to respect the Treaties and provide to the Parliament the necessary information.
*Yo Consider that it treats  of an important step with seen to the preparation of a resolution of the Council of Security based in the foundation of the Chapter *VII and wanted to take advantage of the occasion to urge also to the permanent members of the Council of Security to that they assume an active paper in the preparation of a resolution of these characteristics.
The politics that has developed up to now the European Union regarding *Rusia no always has been exemplary, but even so *yo want to manifest my confidence in that the combination of a global strategy and the new Regulation of *TACIS that it has to go in in vigour in the year 2000 will translate  in a clear improvement of the adoption and execution of the decisions of the European Union in the field of the relative politics to *Rusia.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate on the recommendation for the *segunda reading of the report (To4-0245/99) by part of the Mr. *Jarzembowsky in name of the Commission of Transports and relative Tourism to the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the relative Council to the application of *gravámenes to the heavy vehicles of transport of commodities by the utilisation of determined infrastructures (13651/3/98 - *C4-0037/99-96/0182(*SYN)).
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, before happening to tackle the subject of the institutional reforms, like president of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, when opening my last public intervention, *yo also wanted to express publicly my gratitude to the President of our Parliament by the common work that have made.
*Cuando, on 13 December, said  that the Treaty of *Amsterdam *le gave the possibility to the Parliament, for the first time in his history, to adopt a uniform statute for his members, that this statute had to go in in vigour in the moment in that the ratification of the Treaty of *Amsterdam provided the necessary juridical base for his approval, left  believe that we were smart to approve a statute.
We go back to present it in the second Inform #Martin, because we #can not *rendirnos. In benefit of the health of the #european citizens have to follow defending the positive effects of the moderate consumption of the wine in front of the groups of the population that do not know that the wine is the preventive medicine more effective and more pleasant against the #Alzheimer, the cancer, the *senilidad and #others #a lot of illnesses.
When violating knowingly the agreement of *Wye *Plantation, of October of 1998, the *cual forbids any unilateral measure that #can complicate the negotiation on the final statute of the territories, the #israeli Government pursues a deliberate strategy that consists in *vaciar of his substance the future negotiation and in removing a territorial continuity to *Cisjordania, to prevent like this the feasibility of a future #palestinian State.
I consider that it is necessary that carry out two things: in the first place, the *restablecimiento of a constitutional and civil order and the end of the coup d'état that -as they said my colleagues- is the *decimoctavo from the half of the years seventy; second and to #the same time, is precise to continue the process of agreement national also with these strengths that no only are military and that pretend to follow keeping the hegemony of some groups of population of an island with regard to the other.
Finally, some last words directed to the Mr. *Poettering, without the spirit of *referirme of special way to the political decisions interns, since I consider that we are in the European Parliament and here #would not have to talk of *Alemania like main subject. Without embargo, *yo #can *asegurarle a thing, gentleman *Poettering: precisely the green Party learnt the lesson of *Bosnia and also has learnt now the of *Kosovo, and also #would have assumed this responsibility with another composition of the Government.
To the colleague of the *PDS that, on the one hand, *nos has criticised that have ignored the #french positions #as well as the goals of the #french politics but that, to #the same time, *nos has thrown strongly in face the deficient results of the commitment of the agricultural market of the summit of *Berlín, only #can *decirle that they are looks in some mood interrelated. It #would have to examine more exactly #if at the end, by like this say it, do not drops *usted same in a tangle of contradictions.
Gentleman President, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, repair the dramatic material consequences and, especially, morals of the drama that has lived *Kosovo, collaborate with the International Penal Court so that the crimes committed do not remain *impunes, seat the bases of the economic development of the zone to end of *propiciar the reconciliation of the village *albanokosovar and of the #serbian village have to be questions absolutely *prioritarias for the European Union.
It #would give *usted to the majority of the Assembly, of circumstantial form, the possibility to pronounce  on the political affinities that they #can exist among #such or *cual deputy that has stamped his signature to the foot of the writing of constitution of a group and know very well that exist, also in the breast of the majority groups, factions that are not neither with a lot of agreement among *ellas on a common political program.
Therefore, it wanted to go back to remember that in the last session *plenaria *yo signalled that, of compliance with our Regulation, the Assembly decides on the composition of the tables of the delegations *interparlamentarias, but corresponds to the mixed parliamentary commissions proceed, as they take it also the parliamentary commissions, to the election of his tables, #such as we have taken it in the Commission of Subjects Inner, for example, and in #all the commissions.
For example, it is not possible to detain the delinquency organised, the traffic of persons, the bleaching of money and the terrorism only through the police collaboration, #if to #the same time allows  the free circulation among the countries members, so much of the community citizens as of #all the other, and much less #if the surveillance of the external borders sees  weakened, it that it is unavoidable with the enlargement of the Union.
It #can not  admit that the key field of the justice, that no only affects to the protection of the citizen of face to the outside, but that also guarantees the protection of the citizen in front of the state institutions, do not take into account the protection against erroneous executive measures neither the corresponding control in benefit of the citizens.
Amen of *eso, has not had any objection in accessing to the proposal of the #french Government to assign to Pascal *Lamy the wallet of Trade External, although this gentleman is the architect of the "system #Jacques *Delors" . With this system has implanted  in the Commission a financial structure totally #abstruse.
Always I have been of the opinion that a military intervention foreigner only had to take place in the national interest of the nation-Been that it treat , and without embargo the grave deterioration and the spiral of violence in the region required the adoption of measures and fulfilled the conditions of the new external politics ethical concerning the *cual *Portugal is Been member of right plenary.
In the resolutions adopted in June of 1999 on the *preparativos of the third meeting of the Ministers of the *OMC, the Council remitted  clearly to the agreements of the Bosses of State in the Summit of Colony the days 3 and 4 June 1999, in the *cuales supported  some negotiations that cover a wide fan of subjects, among *ellos the labour norms, like the best half to achieve substantial results and balanced in benefit of #all the members of the *OMC.
The Commission already has remitted a document to the Presidency of the Council and to the Parliament in the that proposes a clear division of the functions of the services of the agency and of the personnel among *Pristina and *Salónica, with #all the operative services centred in *Pristina and the director of the agency rooted there in his centre of operations.
Report (To5-0010/99) of the Mrs. *Morgantini, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation on the proposal of decision of the Council (*COM(1999) 334 - *C5-0059/1999 - 1999/0143(*CNS)) by the that approves  the text of the *Décimo Agreement *CE-*OOPS for the period 1999-2001, before the signature of the Agreement by the Commission and the Organism of Dramas Public and Aid of the Nations Joined for the refugees of Palestinian in the Near Orient
Likewise, the services of the Commission, that has managed the helps to *Rusia, have to elaborate a report on the modalities of employment of the bottoms and, finally, asks  the creation of a commission of investigation, composed by the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the *BEI and the *BERD, that check how many and #which finances sent to *Rusia have used  for the planned ends, for example, the program *TACIS.
Regarding #Grecia, already it has said , the damages also have been great, have thrown roots in the population - have visited the zone - the anxiety by the morning, especially for having ascertained that, in the construction of the houses, it that predominated was the benefit and no the care to the persons that were paying for buying  a house.
The *avispados advisers that are to my side *me say that according to our Regulation, has been correct the behaviour of the Parliament and of the President of session, my predecessor, as in the agenda says  that among the 15 and 16 hours will take place the statement of the Commission on the financial crisis in *Rusia and that the debate of urgency will begin immediately after the statement of the Commission or to more take to the 16 hours.
The *segunda will be the of how competitions will transfer *usted of the Commission to this new agency and maybe to #some of the that already exist, so that they #can exert better his tasks and assist to the agency commissioned of the *inocuidad of the foods in the resolution of the relative problems to the foods in *Europa. )How it will guarantee the surrender of accounts of these new agencies? )It #would examine *usted, for example, the possibility to celebrate auditions here, in the European Parliament, to choose to the directors of said agencies?
Alas, to date, in #a lot of cases, the citizen only receives with hindsight information on these subjects of the daily life that *le affect, *cuando in a so delicate field the performances #would have to have preventive character, of #such mood that the alimentary chain ensure really the corporal and mental welfare of the consumers and do not convert  in object of speculation for the economic interests.
The resolution is at least a statement of our position on our relations with our big neighbour, and #if the Parliament had not expressed his opinion on this important subject, #would have supposed a *incumplimiento of his responsibility like international parliament, and a #sad indication that the politics of the Fortress *Europa is alive and receives more support of the that had to in the breast of this Assembly.
In the Protocol of *Kioto, and also in the agreement on the climate, stipulates  that #if a community of nations with economic cooperation, as it is the case of EU, do not fulfils in his group the commitments purchased, the responsibility *recae on each #one of the integral states of the community, is to say, that #if #some States members do not fulfil the goals, #all the Union suffers the consequences.
But also it has to ask to the services of *Euratom that effect a complete analysis of the group of the official regulations of security of our head offices, and around the head offices, in *Europa, to know #if it respects  the group of the conditions of security; to know #if still they #can  add procedures of urgency in case that they produce  regrettable human negligences, that are worse, especially in these last years, that an unpredictable accident that, by definition, #can seed the panic.
I #can not finish my presentation without *indicarles that #this is not the only solution of the problem and that our Parliamentary Commission wishes to put of relief the need that other parliamentary commissions occupy  of this risk for the security in the next directive on broadcasts of commercial vehicles weighed and also in other norms of proof of vehicles, for *cerciorarse that the cover defective of deposits of fuel withdraw  of the circulation, was in full road, was in annual proofs of the commercial vehicles.
Concerning the worry of the Parliament by the possible resultant consequences of the transfer of the assignments of the category 4 allocated to the provision of help to the less advanced countries, do not have to forget that, of compliance with the Agreement of *Lomé, the European Bottom of Development funds the helps of the EU to these countries.
Our positions of principle in this sense, together with the balance among independence, reliability, transparent advertising and the necessary consolidation of the monetary dialogue, are from our point of seen decisive elements to judge the work of the #ECB and also for the formulation of our report and the approach of the procedure of work of the Parliament.
Wail, therefore, that frustrated  in the stage of commission and have not presented  today in front of this Assembly the attempts to demand to the Bank that published the names of the assistants, the vote on the monetary measures, after a period of grace of some two years, #as well as the publication of the models *econométricos of the #ECB.
The Commission will open also a debate on other important political fields. The prevention of conflicts, the previous forecast to the crises and to the catastrophes and the humanitarian help based and focused to the human rights, is to say, the humanitarian help that centres  more in the human rights of the victims.
The new global approach that has decided  give to the subjects of immigration and asylum, #as well as the commitment of the European Council to apply entirely the Convention of Gin on the Statute of the Refugee and the decision to aspire to a #european system of asylum are steps in the correct direction.
Lady Speaker, the Council of *Tampere that finishes to devote  to the #european space, called of "Freedom, Security and Justice" adopted #some positive technical decisions to intensify the cooperation in the fight against the delinquency and favour the judicial coordination, by means of a greater utilisation, for example, of the mutual recognition of the judicial resolutions in civil or penal matter that *usted same, lady Speaker, recommended, by it other, in his preliminary speech.
My Group had expressed the wish that like this it was from the case "*Michelin": said of another mood -as it finishes to repeat -, the simultaneous announcement fact by the direction of this big company, in front of financial analysts, of the #obtaining of benefits substantial, by a part, and, by #another, the decision to suppress in *Europa 7.500 places of work.
#One, that *me #would seem quite positive, #would consist in creating an instance of *concertación of experts in the #european level without subtracting the minor can of decision to the national states on the fundamental matters, the most next to the worries of the citizens; the #another, that *me #would seem much more negative, #would consist in creating a supplementary element to deprive to the nations of his right of *salvaguarda, that, without embargo, is inalienable.
The transparency of the process, regarding the preparation of the general guidelines of economic politics and the guidelines in matter of politics of employment, consolidates  more with a *dictamen official and public of the Economic and Social Committee that with a query of character *tripartito that, at most, #can *tipificarse like obligation of prudence and diligence #Can the Commission answer the question of how sees the relation among the dialogue *macroeconómico proposed and the Economic and Social Committee already existent?
By the contrary, why #can not say that #if we are able to invest the tendency to the *decremento of the economic growth, thanks to the liberalisation and thanks to knowing accept openly the challenges of the new economy, there will be wealth and will exist the possibility to increase the wages *vinculándolos to the productivity and to the results of the companies in place of *vincularlos to the national collective agreements or Europeans.
Of here that *me seem regrettable that now, to the principle of the process, the parts give the impression to protect  in the importance of his own autonomy in the field of his competitions: the administrations concerning his budgetary politics, the social speakers concerning the negotiations *salariales, and the Central Bank concerning the monetary politics.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, the present managerial form splits of the strategy of reduction of the broadcasts CO2 in the field of the transport of the EU, the *cual supports  in four *pilares: information to the consumers -the present managerial-, fiscal stimuluses of the States members, surveillance of the broadcasts of CO2 of the vehicles of tourism and the Agreement among the commission and the car industry.
The fact that it was difficult remains shown by two circumstances: a common agreement almost general on the urgency and the importance to adopt effective politics to struggle against the unemployment and with regard to that #this occur inside a frame in that the necessary support to a positive economic process keep the social cohesion and the social model European.
The structural unemployment possesses varied indicators: labour costs excessively high, deficient flexibility in the labour days and in the biographies of the workers, an industry of services insufficiently developed, a regulatory density excessively high by part of the state and of the bureaucracy, speeds of innovation too much slow, periods too much long of transfer among the scientific knowledge and his put in practice in the production.
In this sense, think to treat the subject in the next ministerial meeting of the European Conference of the Civil Aviation, that will take place on 28 January next, and, #such as I have indicated before, the communication of the Commission devoted to this question will present  to the Parliament to finals of this year and to the Council of Ministers of Transport, specifically in the meeting of 6 December.
To his *Señorías *les corresponds a fundamental paper to the hour to reflect these points of sight and to contribute to the preparation of an external politics and of common security more effective, more coherent, nearer to the worries of the citizens and that reflect the values and the principles that have forged our identity like Europeans.
It had wished, gentleman #Solana, that was more explicit on the bottom of this essential question and that *nos said how, in the field of the *PESC, went to contribute to correct, in the measure in that it still was possible, the most disastrous consequences for our continent of the actions that *usted same, #if it has not ordered, at least has protected in *Yugoslavia whereas General Secretary of the NATO and that today have in front of *nosotros.
In these decisions are also the commitments of the States members to build a specific military strength that strengthen the capacity of the EU to make #worthy actions of credit, in accordance with the principles of the Convention of Nations Joined, without that put  in cloth of trial the particular interests of *algún Been member and without that the EU take #his the fundamental missions of the NATO.
The main focus of attention has to be the consolidation of a world-wide order of the trade and the opening of the markets or have to put in a *primer plane the defence of our economic and social model European, of the social and ecological economy of market and of the community politics that come developing in favour of the interests of the citizen and of the consumer?
Gentleman President, it that it is necessary to appreciate in the Report *Schwaiger is the attempt to conciliate it that up to now has resulted *irreconciliable, and the considerable effort of the speaker notes , definitely, from the *primer considering, in that to the recognition of the strong increase of the world-wide exchanges, thanks to the relations *multilaterales, #can not but *contraponer the fault of a substantial reduction of the economic inequalities in the world.
By the contrary, #if we take a road integrated of the bond among intellectual property and development, simultaneously to the extension of his guarantees, have to watch for boosting the direct investment like main vehicle of transfer of technology to these countries, #as well as for developing with *ellos agreements of technological cooperation and perhaps -launch this idea- by *reflexionar on the reinforcement of the #european investment in fundamental investigation on the living beings to share the benefits with *ellos.
Had account that the proposals of the Commission -and to this *respecto am very grateful to the Mr. *Barnier- foresee a similar division for the procedures of modification, *me seems a sample of *pusilanimidad that the Commission of Subjects Constitutional of this Parliament yes approve the division in two of the Treaties, but do not accept the differentiation of the procedures.
Without embargo, want to indicate that, from the point of sight of the Union, probably is quite better the politics to adopt a constructive attitude so that *Turquía do not give entirely the back to the European Union and leave to try fulfil with the principles that *nosotros have added in the criteria of *Copenhague for the adhesion and in other #ours resolutions.
For example, the final mandate awarded by the Council, on 22 October, do not mentions the defence of the principle of the community preference, in spite of having been approved by the Council "Agriculture" of 27 September, the *cual had not been of the all satisfactory, when forgetting the principle of the alimentary independence in *Europa.
How they #can sue the villages of *Europa the *reforzamiento of the international paper of the EU with the creation of a new political entity and juridical and with the impulse of a defence and common security, *cuando the EU is responsible, beside the NATO, of the first action of war after the *Segunda World-wide War, the aggression, in break of #all notion of right international, against *Yugoslavia?
But #this has posed inconvenient, because the problem that has Canarian, like other regions *ultraperiféricas -*Azores, *Madeira and the #french departments of *Ultramar-, is that they are regions very #move# away of the community territory, divided in small insular territories, with markets very reduced, with some problems of transport enormous and, besides, with derivative difficulties, for example, of the excess of population, of a diet of rains very irregular and of poor floors, that prevent that they develop  normal activities.
*Cuando Prepared yesterday my intervention on the Reports *Morillon, in a text of the European Parliament, of the Secretariat of the Group of Work for the Enlargement, of International and Institutional Relations of the General Direction *IV, under responsibility of the Mrs. *Martine *Chariot, in the point 6 of the report on the relations of *Turquía with the European Union affirms  *algo surprising and of the all unacceptable:
But also I want to say that in the Basque Country is absolutely necessary a political commitment as in *Irlanda, of #such form that do not costs the *cerrazón, even the reactionary character -#would say *yo- of the postures of the #spanish Government, that denies  to accept a political commitment with the national parties Basques in the course of the process of peace.
A last information: the Mrs. *Maj *Britt *Théorin, speaker of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, has adopted an initiative that *me seems of it nicer, the to send to #all our masculine colleagues a letter for *animarlos to carry a white bow like signal of his public commitment of not committing violences neither *excusar or *callar the violence against the women.
In the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, in view of that there #be parity among the world of the sport, on the one hand, and, by #another, the of the governments and that #all the members of the council of administration, therefore, also the federations and #all the national olympic committees, have engaged  to put in practice, each in his field, the decisions adopted by the agency, there are hopes.
In the future, beginning with the budgetary exercise 2001, the procedure of configuration of the budget of the EU will have to follow the political priorities more *marcadamente that up to now ,and to this *respecto the decisions about the priorities do not have to cover only the operative means but also the necessary personal resources so that it take a greater assignment of personnel there #where are the political priorities.
But it had celebrated that owing to the adjusted result of the vote that had in the commission -a vote of difference- had shown  *algo more of disposal for the commitment by part of the speaker and of his group, since -I say it today very clearly- #if we vote the Wednesday and our amendment 7, the reduction of the contingents of base to 500, is not approved go to vote against of the whole of the report.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0077/1999), in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, concerning the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone (5748/3/1999 - *C5-0034/1999 - 1998/0228) (Speaker: Mrs. *Hulthén).
As a result of the European Council of *Helsinki, on the *cual has celebrated  this morning here, in the Plenary, a debate with the presence of the President of the Commission, #this has approved a proposal of decision of the Council with seen to the official approval of the lines guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000.
From the point of sight purely financial, in addition to the technical assistance with charge to *PHARE -22 millions of euros- and the financial protocol, a subvention for the payment of the interests of the loans of the *BEI that rises to 20 millions of euros, have devoted 143 millions of euros of exceptional assistance to help to this country to confront the consequences of the crisis of *Kosovo.
And the paper of the European Union, of the Commission and of the European Parliament in this sense is important, since, as it has signalled , there are #a lot of agreements signed among the European Union and *Macao. It is well that, during the next 50 years, the European Parliament and our #european institutions #can follow the evolution of *Macao, a lucky evolution, create *yo.
Regarding the decisions on the granting of credits of the European Bank of Investments, the mentioned project *Gardaland has been treated before in the Parliament in the turn of questions oral to the Commission and, according to the information received by the Council, in this occasion exposed  very in detail the arguments that defend this project and his advantages, so that I do not go to go back to *repetirlos.
Likewise, the Council loaned attention to the approach of the Commission in relation with a structural reform of the aerial space wider, #whose goal is to create an aerial space uniform in *Europa, and received also with satisfaction the purpose of the Commission to create a Group of high level that study the looks of this subject and present to the Council a report *aclaratorio the next June.
The Council is conscious that, in the case of the Mrs. Titin *Loizidou, the European Court of the rights of the man considered that *Turquía had violated the European Treaty for the protection of the rights of the man, to the *inculparse in the undue appropriation of the rights of property in *Chipre of the North, and condemned to *Turquía to effect compensations.
The Council underlines that #all the States members voted in favour of a transitory resolution on the subject, that was approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of *Europa on 6 October 1999 and in the that signalled  that the conditions of payment proposed by the Government of *Turquía #can not be considered satisfied with the obligations imposed by the sentence of the Court and also exhorted  to *Turquía that reviewed his posture.
In the Directive 98/58/*CE of the relative Council to the protection of the animals of breeding declares  that it will not administer  to an animal #any another substance, with exception of the administered for therapeutic ends or *profilácticos, unless scientific studies of the animal welfare or of the experience established have shown that his effect is not hurtful for the health or the welfare of the animal.
Have the security that our European Parliament is very satisfied for having taken part in the pressures of the international community, that have contributed to that the #indonesian President *Habibie have released it the past 7 September, little after the referendum of 30 August, in the that the 70,5% of the population of *Timor Oriental pronounced  in favour of the independence.
Therefore, *señorías, the commitment to the that get with the Commission of Budgets consists in not approving more that the loan of 75 millions of euros, agreeing - a position of the Commission of Industry that has comprised , create, by part of the Commission of Budgets - in that *Tayikistán #would owe also can enjoy of a supplementary help to lighten the monthly charge of the debt, 200.000 euros, *algo that it is *insoportable for this country.
The conversations that have come  celebrating with the speaker and #some of the remaining deputies to the Parliament since it took place the debate on the report of the Mr. Go *Dam, previously of the Mr. *Wijsenbeek, during the session *plenaria of February have reinforced even more my *convencimiento, in this case the of the Mr. *Kinnock, that we agree on the need to improve the incentives and the competitiveness of the transport combined.
Especially regarding the questions of discrimination of greater persons, the problems of sight and hearing, the questions of unemployment -that, with frequency, affect to the most greater- or the social exclusion, is important that aspire by means of the training in the breast of the public opinion to avert in #all moment the exclusion of any social group.
Regarding the Grandstand of Justice, here fits to highlight the fine utilisation that has taken  of the system of rent-buys of the buildings annexes to the *Palais and, on the other hand, regarding the anticipation of the 50 millions of *ecus that carried out, *yo only #would highlight here *algo that in his moment -the year 1997- *nos concerned: the series of commitments that kept the Government *luxemburgués with the Parliament and that did not know in that moment #if the #would fulfil or no...
We do not agree with the editorial of the paragraph 1 and wish to suppress the definite «word» of this paragraph, because in the Parliament has not celebrated  in any moment a vote on the question of the approval of the corresponding management to 1996, recommended by the Commission of Control Budgetary to this Assembly.
In both reports, in the report of the Mr. *Elles, and here include also to our speaker, the Mr. *Brinkhorst, for 1997, it is necessary to take into account really two things: we have not voted on conditions for the granting of the approval of the management, have added documents of work; #this is an unusual procedure, but believe that it has been hit and here has said  it that go to take get like suggestions, and also like requirements, to the next Commission.
The Commission presented his resignation as a result of the procedure of said management. Although it has reached  introduce numerous improvements, explanations and positive solutions in this process, runs  the danger that the procedure of approval of the management and of the distinct questions #can be too much wide, since, in accordance with the fundamental regulation of the EU, corresponds to the Parliament approve the budgetary management.
But especially, gentleman Commissioner, taking into account the problems posed by the previous agreements to the *OMC on this type of products, wanted to *preguntarle #if it #can engage to reopen the *dossier of the *OMC in two points: a better definition of the principle of caution, especially through the investment of the charge of the proof in case of doubt, and, a second point, a better definition of the *dictamen *pericial, since the alimentary code #can not consider like legitimate univocal reference.
In effect, this sector -in concrete the clothes of bed of cotton and the pieces of cashmere- to the equal that other sectors, specifically the that appear in the list that accompanies to the statement of the sentence of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, will see increased his tariffs to the exports in a 100 % after the decision adopted by part of the organ of arbitration of the *OMC.
In this sense, the Commission and his President will have to boost, with the collaboration of this Parliament, the scarce political will of the Council to define an external politics and of #european common security, without character *subalterno regarding the States Joined, that serve to guarantee at the same time the human rights in the *Balcanes and all over the world and also the fulfillment of the international Right.
It do not treats  of an abstract question, but that affects to the solution to questions like the enlargement, the institutional reform in strict sense and the creation of a structure of politics external and of common defence that, as we see in the conflict of *Kosovo, *Europa needs absolutely, because it shows that *carece of an autonomous capacity to answer to the crises like the that are registering  in this region.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, gentleman *Prodi, the circumstances with that confronts  are difficult and at the same time also easy. Difficult to the sight of the challenges that will have to confront the European Union in the next five years and easy because a renewal of the Commission had not explained never with a so wide support of the Parliament, of the Council and of the #european public opinion.
#Ours dip on a long-term basis has to be, by means of a fast development of the cooperation and opening the doors to the EU, the achievement in the *Balcanes of it that have achieved in the European Union: ensure the democracy, build an economy that give welfare to the persons and surpass the limits among the countries, so that our national identities have lower importance and that do not matter #if we are #german, #portuguese, Greeks, Dutches or #swedish for our possibilities of life.
It is necessary an act of the strongest part and more reasonable that put end to the bombardments to see the letters that are on the table, to restart the negotiations and to find an exit to the problem, without damage, as it is obvious, to guarantee through a military strength the right of the refugees to return to *Kosovo.
The Commission has proposed to continue the efforts of the last years treating to centre the internal politics on growth and the costs related with the employment, especially the investigation and the technical development, the networks *transeuropeas, the education and the training, #as well as the small and medium enterprises, that has been a parliamentary initiative.
To)it Is necessary a greater and more effective development of the cooperation among the States members, as there #be not sufficient cooperation.*b)It is necessary to contribute to that the protection of the persons and the sakes accompany  of a better and more intelligent relation with the nature that allow to avert the avoidable catastrophes. #Many of *ellas are it.*c)Has to take a reference expresses to the isolated regions and *ultraperiféricas and to the difficulties that suffer by his geographic conditions, orographic and social.
Finally, but above #everything, is correct the way in that the text recognises the equality of the Parliament and the Council: the committee will be chaired jointly; it will gather  alternatively in the venues of the European Parliament and of the Council: the texts have to be signed jointly by both presidents; the letters have to be signed by the *copresidentes; even the formalisation by the Jurists-Linguists will carry out by the European Parliament and the Council.
*Señorías, have begun with a personal balance and *me has gone out a collective balance. The of some realisations that correspond to the work, to the obstinacy and to the tarpaulin of #all *ustedes, with the active and loyal collaboration of #all the civil servants of the General Secretariat that loan his services to this Assembly, of the *free-launch , of the parliamentary assistants, of #all.
Now I belong to the group of the veterans of this Parliament and memory how the Presidents of group in #that then were the first to the hour to squander in the costs, were the first, *cuando it was necessary to travel in limousine with driver to charge of the Parliament demanding afterwards the diets of trip to the box of deputies by these same trips.
Only I want to ascertain that the European Union has shown his unit and decision in front of the events in the *Balcanes during the past weeks, beginning by the conjoint statement of the Bosses and State and of Government of 24 March until the last hardening of the penalizing measures by part of the Council of Subjects General the past week.
Regarding the management of the market, this Parliament voted the maintenance of the public intervention and the reinforcement of the control of the production, and *ello *contrariamente to the wishes of the Commission that proposed to balance the markets by effect of the descent of the prices to the production and the instauration of the private storage from the 2002.
In front of the need that the agricultural politics also answer at the beginning of economic and social cohesion and correct #some excesses, like the concentration of the helps in #few hands, the Commission answers that they will be the States members the attendants to reduce the amounts, leaving of a side a necessary community approach and the incorporation of principles general.
Subject: Fraud in the sector *pesquero in the south of *Europa Knows the Council the report of the auditors in the that it criticises  to the Commission by have not taken the necessary cautions to avert the fraud committed with the community bottoms allocated to the modernisation of the fuselages of fishing, the majority of *ellos located in the south of *Europa?
#One of the paramount goals in the conception of the structural measures for this sector of face to the next #millenium has to be *mantenerlas it simpler and coherent possible, with the end to guarantee that they are it sufficiently flexible to answer to the specifically regional needs in the field *pesquero, in the dependent regions of the fishing or there #where exist important communities of fishermen.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0248/99) of the Mrs. *Oddy, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens, on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to determined juridical looks of the electronic trade in the inner market (*COM(98)0586 - *C4-0020/99-98/0325 (*COD)).
After the conclusions of the European Council of *Berlín, our Commission of Politics Regional had to struggle in a significant front for the group of the #european citizens: the creation of #one *cuarta community initiative, *URBAN, allocated to the economic and social rehabilitation of the cities and urban cores in crisis, with regard to promoting a development *durable.
#The same has made a gesture of wide political scope and of unilateral generosity in benefit of the process of peace, has averted a dramatic transition, a negative influence in the #israeli elections and a grave crisis of the process of peace, with the danger of a resumption of the conflict in military terms.
This subject *reviste a special importance in the case of the nuclear head offices, especially in it that to the construction, the operation, the circuit of the fuel and the storage refers . #Everything *ello purchases a particular dimension of face to the agreements of enlargement, since we #can not accept that the States candidates to the adhesion apply a normative less rigid that the that demands  at present in *Europa Western.
Gentleman President, the Commission congratulates  by the adoption of a common project on recognitions of diplomas by part of the Committee of Conciliation and, in name of the Commission, #would wish to express my gratitude particularly to the Mrs. *Gebhardt, #as well as to the president and to the members of the delegation of the Parliament in said conciliation, by #all the efforts made during these last four months to obtain this conjoint text.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam had not resolved the problem of the operation of the Institutions and, regarding the external politics, the only advance was to appoint to *Mister *PESC that, without embargo, was not still in functions during the crisis of *Kosovo that, without expecting the delays and the continuous absences of *Europa, burst like a scourge and renewed the crimes of the ethnic cleansing that already had *gangrenado *Bosnia.
Our goal is to increase the transparency and the efficiency of the performances of the Council; we consider that a greater transparency is indispensable condition so that the citizens approve #all the project of the Union.Also we want that the Council of Subjects General assume his paper in the direction of the Council of Ministers.
Among the measures *prioritarias that have to fund  in the frame of the credits *OPNOVA include , among #others, the cleansing of mines, the purchase of materials for the reconstruction of houses and of public buildings, the help to the companies of services public, to the customs and a program of employment and local rehabilitation.
In the letter, the Mr. *Santer specified that the Mr. *Bangemann #can not undertake his new tasks and activities while it had not completed  the procedure established in the article 215 of the Treaty, and said likewise that #would subject to the School of Commissioners the question of the compatibility of the planned nomination with the article 213 of the Treaty.
Of course, the Mr. *Bangemann is personally responsible of his mood to act, but a politics that orients  preferably to the economic interests and especially to the interests of the great companies, is necessarily subjected to the danger that his main representatives reproduce this mood to think as *ejecutores of this politics and that devote  to *maximizar his personal benefits against of any moral code.
The Government, first did not know how was it that was happening, adopted a posture of total indifference, next wanted to throw earth on the subject until after the elections and finally took  manager of a reaction of panic evidently exaggerated that caused all over the world a boycott of the products called #belgian but of the that the first victim has been my country, *Flandes, since the greater part of the exports called «#belgian» of course are exports of *Flandes.
Lady Speaker, to difference of the previous orators, that were #all of #english nationality - watch by where!-, *yo #would wish to protest against the decision of the quite surprising -Commission, to my mood to see- to impose a sanction to the #french Federation of football by a supposed discrimination in the sale of entrances in the last Glass of the World of football.
Although my rules of hygiene mental for the weekends *me have prevented to devote to the reading of the report the hours that definitely deserves, believe that has an additional virtue little appreciated by my predecessors in the use of the word: in #a lot of points collects positions of the Parliament and proposals that were not received *favorablemente in his day.
#One of the extenuating circumstances on the lacks of the Commission, that  *trasluce along the report, is the fault of means with the that explain the services of the Commission to carry out the politics that *nosotros, deputies, agree in the field of the cooperation for the development and of the humanitarian help, flags both of the community external action.
I comprise the comment of the Commissioner about the subsidiariness, but are arguing because in the Parliament there #be a directive of frame minimum that did not invades the subsidiariness and that solves the problem when creating the obligation in the States members to establish an inspection inside some wide guidelines.
It say here that the commission of investigation on the linen in the Congress of the Deputies already has approved his conclusions, declare clearly that this commission has exempted of any responsibility to the Mrs. Of Palace, situating the responsibility of the management, control and granting of the helps in the #spanish Autonomous Communities, notoriously in the governed by #one of his *correligionarios in *Castilla-The Stain.
Finally, regarding the space of justice, our purpose #would have to be the to take all it possible so that the citizen have the feeling to find , in #all the territory of the European Union, in front of a frame of justice that was suitable and in the that they protect  his rights of way similar, no only in front of the criminals, but also even in front of possible excesses of the public powers.
The constructive participation of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence and the Commission of Budgets of the Parliament also deserve my gratitude, and inside a moment will happen to comment the amendments presented by the Commission of Budgets, subject to the that has referred  the Mr. *Khanbhai.
The paper of the Commission and of the #european institutions has to, in the very concrete case of the alimentary security, limit to negotiate the principle of caution in the frame of the international agreements and to coordinate the politics of the States members and of the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0016/99) of the Mr. *Langen, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a program *plurianual of promotion of the renewable energies in the *Comuniad (*ALTENER) (1998-2002) (7122/1/99 - *C5-0032/99 - 97/0370(*COD)).
The Parliament expresses, besides, in the section 1 of the article 1, the will that it carry out the campaign allocated to promote the penetration of the sources of energy renewable, #such as already it advocates  in the White Book of 1997, and that also they develop  new instruments and mechanisms that allow to boost a penetration accelerated and coordinated in the market of #all the sustainable energetic technologies.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation (To5-0020/1999) of the Mrs. *Kinnock, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, on the proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Agreement of Trade, Development and Cooperation among the European Community, by a part and the Republic of *Sudáfrica, by another (8731/1999 *COM(1999) 245 - *C5-0154/1999 - 1999/0112(*AVC)).
And finally I want to take a question on the budget: taking into account that almost #all the transfers centre  in the category *cuarta, #this is, in the external actions of the Union, and that #this is #one of the points that produces more dissatisfaction in my Group and, in general, in the Commission of Budgets, did not believes the gentleman President that #would be convenient to review the financial perspectives regarding the external politics of the Union?
Has foreseen the Commission use methods of communication more modern as, for example, the acquisition of #time of advertising, of 3 to 5 daily minutes, issued among the #news and the sport of the main newscast of the television network with greater audience of each Been member, to present with character of divulging the attainments and goals of the EU, directing mainly to the social coats that usually do not read and that definitely are not the addressees of our material?
Support firmly the observation that has taken my colleague of the *PPE, Mr. *Bowis, that we do not owe of any way export our problem of the world developed, through the taxes on our old head offices with levels of problematic broadcast and move these places of work and these units of production to regions less developed, #where are less prepared to cut across the degradation of the environment.
Of course, they exist limits to our realism; of here that we also want to use today this moment to protest by the situation in this country, and take an urgent call to the Government of *Bielorrusia so that it take *algo in front of the disappearances and occupy  that the missing are found, so that #this constitute a reason in himself/hisself same to initiate really a dialogue that allow the celebration of elections free and just, expect, the next year.
Among these political goals the human rights occupy a place stood out, together with the free access to the informative means, the end of the bullying against the opposition, a constructive dialogue among the opposition and the government, and the backrest to the program *TACIS of development of the civil society.
#Some of *ustedes have  *percatado surely that the plastic materials use  increasingly in the industry of vehicles of engine and this norm of proof uniform will offer to the designers the possibility to concentrate  in the fulfillment of an alone norm, instead of having to consecrate his efforts to the fulfillment of #all a series of norms different.
We have voted in this sense an amendment that corresponds to an important political commitment of this Parliament, although we vote it above the category 4, it that it wants to say that to the day of today there #be not statute of amendment, but that corresponds to a commitment of this Assembly to vote these credits with occasion of the *segunda reading, mainly regarding the agreement with *Marruecos, that is a political priority of this Parliament.
They give  account that it will be necessary to reduce in a 10 % the efforts against the mines *antipersonas, that also appear in our budgetary lines, or the measures of support to the no governmental organisations that work in the countries in development, as for example in *Guatemala or in other regions of the world, because we are unable to use the imagination, because we do not want *detenernos to consider exactly of where go to go out these resources?
In the first place, no *me seems #worthy of credit that from the European Parliament demand, on the one hand, to #all the other institutions and very especially to the Commission the most rigorous control and expect that the organisation chart of the personnel adapt  to the new requirements, and *nos propose that #this remain reflected, besides, in the #european Budget, while by the #another side are not had to act in #the same sense in our own field, regarding the budget and the administration of the Parliament.
Already it has signalled  in brief that the report occupies  especially of the year 1998, the year in the that  *dictaminó how countries -eleven in total- fulfilled the criteria of convergence, decided  where #would have his headquarters of the #ECB, proceeded  to the absorption of the *IME, initiated  the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union, and the Council of the #ECB decided his strategy of stability, based in the two *pilares already known.
Regarding his #dutch past, the Central Bank of the Low Countries, that chaired during #a lot of years, found  in the centre of the field of strengths social #where developed  the economic and social politics and *yo see it like a model for the implication of the Central Bank European in the dialogue *macroeconómico #european.
The report of the experts contained proposed on how #would have to concretise this bridge to make the transition to the help to the development or to other instruments of support to the development, as for example the programs *PHARE and *TACIS? And it has determined  #if the problems have his origin in the help of THROW and in the design of the project, or #if they are imputable to the other helps?
Without these minimum measures and #others, accompanied of concrete measures against the transfers of companies inside the European Union and other measures against the *dumping social in the outside, the social model European, so expensive to #some of our politicians, included the of rights, will not be never another thing that an empty speech, it that #would contribute to strengthen a feeling *antieuropeo diffuse in our countries and in numerous employees.
#If a part of the social speakers, the that are suffering the world-wide competition and on the that #all are, really, of agreement in that they have to be helped and protected -because *nos interest the #european companies that they #can compete worldwide- expresses his restlessness by the society and by the maintenance of the social balance, have a significant argument for the development and the support to the social dialogue.
In effect, in this delicate stage for the European Union, while it is setting up the enlargement to the East and while they are making  #all the economic and financial reforms related with the introduction of the only coin, do not have to forget the value "culture" , the specificities and the diversities of the #european culture, his assessment and diffusion.
Gentleman President, to initiative of the socialist Group and with the backrest of the #others Groups, the Commission of Fishing has formulated this oral question to the European Commission and to the, once again, absent Council of Ministers so that it expose  in front of the #european citizenship #which is the current situation of the contacts kept with the #moroccan authorities, with seen to the negotiation for a future Agreement of fishing European Union-*Marruecos.
After the expiration of the previous agreement, gentleman Commissioner, produced  a tie up that it lasted seven months, to the that it was necessary to add the natural biological stops and other stops no so biological and more arbitrary, imposed by the #moroccan Administration to a European Commission that did not know to defend the interests of his persons, as they test it the numerous *apresamientos *injustificados and #some even out of the economic zone #moroccan scoop.
It proposes  that the European and Chinese Union close a specific agreement of scientific and technical cooperation so as to increase and expand the cooperation, #among others fields, in fields like the energy, the environment, the sciences of the nature, the sciences of the materials, the transport, the telematic, and the technologies of the information and the communication.
A projection of these figures indicates that the #european industry invests surely among 20.000 and 10.000 millions of frames in efforts of investigation out of the European Union and #if it achieved  use the credits that the European Union puts now to disposal for *movilizar also private resources in the field of the investigation, #this #would contribute to that countries like Argentinian leave to be only extensions of the #european facilities to take part directly in the investigation and the technological development.
Already I posed the question and, very amiably, the Speaker *me has given an answer that, without embargo, consider no adjusted to the Regulation, because #if the Regulation talks of a week, a week #can not understand like seven working days: seven days #can understand like natural or working and no like a week, to the equal that a month or a year that, for example, #can not consider of 365 working days.
Besides, we support totally the proposals of the speaker on the reduction of the broadcasts of CO2, so that we reach the goals of *Kioto, #as well as the fiscal incentives for the technical adaptation of the most ancient vehicles and the adaptation of the cycles of proofs, so that they register  the real broadcasts of the vehicles in circulation, at least on a long-term basis.
In previous reports of the European Parliament already said  that the big culture of the car was the main manager of the pollution of the air in *Europa, and the Parliament exerts now an active paper in the establishment of the maximum values of the distinct *contaminantes to reach the control of this environmental problem.
I create and I expect, as, that the Parliament #can, from this report, receive income especially through this reference #as well as through #others, and seen the elements that #this contain,  #one to a formal claim to authorise to the Conference *Intergubernamental to tackle at the same time the reforms that  *nos propose and to this fundamental look of the total participation of the Parliament no only regarding the "costs" but also to the "income" of the budget of the Union.
Therefore, it is urgent to unify this energetic debate with the purpose to determine exactly our options of investment and put a #alto to these contradictions that take that five members, at least, of the European Union -*Austria, #Italia, *Dinamarca, *Portugal and #Grecia- that do not resort to the nuclear energy, #would be forced to fund a politics that is, in more of a 50%, still subsidised by the European Union in matter of nuclear energy.
I respect the reasons by the that the #british delegation has abstained  concerning the amendments *núms. 5 and 8 -auxiliary doctors-, but *yo have not followed this line, because, in the first place, treats  of a position negotiator and, second, my immediate familiar experience of #one *comadrona of the *SNS, overwhelmed by an excessive work, no *me allows to impose to some decisive medical personnel labour days longer of it absolutely necessary.
*Ello Has caused that the current #greek authorities have taken a very important decision, specifically the nomination of a new direction, resorting to expert of companies -in concrete the *Speedway, a subsidiary of *British *Airways- that they have to update the plan of reflation of the company and that, am safe, will be able to *ofrecernos along this month sufficient data and the necessary guarantees so that, once and for all, #can authorise the last tract of helps to *Olympic *Airways and reach that #this takeoff adequately and take the flight without greater problems.
It has shown a big opening, which *nos has allowed to reach commitments, no in the sense of the commitments that hide the positions that defend the different Groups, but that have struggled and have taken a true effort to achieve a #european commitment, a #european approach that express the general support to the position of the Council and of the Commission.
Thus it is indispensable that the Commission achieve a harmonisation of the tariffs and the elimination of the beaks *arancelarios and of the progression *arancelaria, #as well as the suppression of #all the technical barriers to the trade, understanding that to the less developed countries  *les has to guarantee the free access to the international market of #all his products so that they #can benefit also *ellos of the commercial liberalisation.
To finish, also *yo want to congratulate to the speaker by his excellent report and by his will to get to a consensus it wider possible on a so important subject like the next Round of the #Millenium, of the *cual depends the consolidation of a commercial system *equitativo that ensure, to world-wide level, an economic order based in the social justice.
The adherents of the liberalisation of the trade whereas engine of prosperity are so much more reluctant to this balance in the measure in that it is difficult to argue the aggravation of the situation in these last years with the reinforcement of the inequalities among the countries with delay in development and the countries advanced, like the development of the inequalities in the same breast of the countries developed.
At present, in spite of the good work of the speakers, the proposal of position of the Parliament runs the risk to be more conservative that the of the Commission, and the Group of the Party of the Liberal, Democrat and European Reformers has presented varied amendments directed to centre the approach of the report and to accelerate the development of #one *Europa parliamentary.
Nevertheless, the construction of #this *Europa do not involves to deprive to the villages and to the homelands of the *margen of autonomy that *les allows to dominate his own destination, is to say, that only #can  undertake #if it supports  in the respect of the national sovereignties, in the adhesion of the villages, in the social consensus and politician, in the opening and the transparency of the processes and in the respect of #all the integral countries.
Subject: Prohibition of supply of fuels and threat of humanitarian catastrophe in *Yugoslavia Is being very questioned and has given place to forceful reactions the opposition of the EU -manifested in the frame of the Council of Ministers of External Subjects celebrated in *Luxemburgo- to supply fuel and products of first need to the inhabitants of *Yugoslavia so that they #can confront the next winter, #as well as the final decision to supply oil, under the lemma "Action for the democracy", only to two #serbian populations, *Nis and *Pirot, controlled by the opposition.
But where it is the protection of the workers, in particular against the drama of the unemployment, even in the richest countries of the European Union, precisely #that that #would have *sobradamente the means to eradicate the unemployment, #if the main worry of his governments did not go the gains of the great companies and the enrichment of his owners and shareholders?
The public and social services, like the education or the health, and also #that in the that are in game the security of the users and the collective interest, like the public transports or the aerial control, the culture and the artistic creation, #can not subject to the balances of a commercial negotiation.
Given the existence of the international agreement reached by means of the Extraordinary Assembly of the Organisation of Nations Joined in June of 1998, for a treatment balanced of the problem, so much in the slope of the decrease of the offer, as in the slope of the decrease of the demand, wanted to underline the possibilities that offers the new Treaty in his article 152.
Gentleman Newton *Dunn, as *nosotros are of the opinion that in the weighting of his proposal, by it other #worthy of attention, and of the intention that the #german Presidency of the Council had in his moment, *nos remain with the that aspires to a wider goal, will refuse his amendments, and no only those referred to the legal base, but #all #that that do not alter the fact that *usted has made an accurate work.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0054/99) of the Mr. *Seppänen in name of the Commission of Budget on the proposed decision of the Council by the that concedes  to the European Bank of Investments a guarantee of the Community to absorb the losses that derive  of the loans for the realisation of projects of reconstruction of the zones affected by the earthquake in *Turquía.
They serve of example the group of prevention of *estupefacientes, that acts in the breast of the Centre of Investigation and Development in the sanitary and social sector of *Finlandia, #as well as the group *Pompidou, group of cooperation of the Council of *Europa created in the decade of the 70 by initiative of the President of *Francia for the fight against the drug addiction and that has slopes #a lot of projects for the reduction of the offer and the demand of *estupefacientes.
I believe that have the obligation bear with our *conciudadanos -and talk to the Speaker in exercise of the Council of a #nordic country that always takes #gala of the transparency- to reach a transparent process in the that, in the first place, the Parliament was properly represented and *me #would enjoy that the Speaker denied those voices that say that the Presidency  *opone to a full representation of the Parliament in the Conference *Intergubernamental with two representatives.
Gentleman President, the Speaker in exercise of the Council affirms that it always enjoys *cuando attends to the Parliament, therefore it results quite extraordinary that in his intervention have not answered to #any of the proposals of the Parliament for the Conference *Intergubernamental, it that comes to confirm the #news appeared in the press, that are reason of worry, that the European Council has chosen an agenda restricted for the *CIG and that the Letter is only *optativa.
During 1998 and 1999 with the approval of the programs of the Commission of the European Parliament through a group of work *interinstitucional, *Turquía received bottoms inside the Program *Meda and the Commission of Control Budgetary has approved the creation of this group of work during the debate of the budget of the year 2000.
*Yo Particularly think -and had the occasion to say it in the debate that kept in the month of October- that, for the first time, #all the pieces of the #turkish puzzle find  on the table: the problem of the islands of the Sea *Egeo, the problem of *Chipre, the problem of the human rights and the problem of the minorities.
In consequence, *nos seems timely that in this occasion give  another very clear signal that the preservation of the human rights and the protection of the minorities in *Turquía follows being the essential condition so that the European Parliament express his solidarity from the point of sight of the cooperation and of the support to this country.
In spite of the diverse political initiatives directed to reduce the pollution and improve the quality of the air, splits  of the base that the needs of transport of *pasajeros will go back to increase drastically in the next ten years and the number of vehicles will increase  in a 25%, it that will suppose a still greater charge for the quality of the air.
Other elements of said strategy are an agreement with the car industry on the reduction of the broadcasts of CO2 inside a term *preestablecido and a system of labeling that indicate the consumption of fuel and facilitate the election of the consumer in the moment of the purchase of a new tourism.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, as it indicates the speaker, Mrs. #Carmen *Fraga *Estévez, the presentation of the proposal of the new regulation of the Council by the that it establishes  the Common Organisation of the Market in the sector of the products of the fishing and the aquaculture produces  in a moment in the that #all the countries of the European Union constitute #one of the greater world-wide markets of products *pesqueros.
Perhaps these demonstrations served of pretext to the official protagonists of the Summit -#that that seated  of right plenary around the table of work- not to assume until the bottom the political responsibility of some certainly difficult negotiations but extremely necessary in matter of social rights and of protection of the health of our citizens, some negotiations that no longer #can expect.
#That is the reason by the that the budget of this year had to reflect in truth the need to reinforce the procedures of control budgetary and, like speaker of the budget for 2000 and in name of the Commission of Control Budgetary, wanted to receive with *beneplácito once again the creation of a new organ to struggle against the fraud and the new places of the *OLAF reflected in the budget for this year.
Subject: Publication of compliance with the article 5 of the Regulation 19/65/*CEE of the Council of 2 March 1965 Has taken into account the Commission the specificity and diversity of the sector of the hospitality industry in *Bélgica, *afamado by the big quantity of friendly bars in the that they serve  beers of the most diverse classes, and the repercussions of the application of the Regulation of reference especially among the small employers of the sector that will see  affected?
Sure enough, there #be a *desfase remarkable among the noisy proclamations of the Union on his wish to exert a more offensive paper in the solution of the great international problems, by a part; and by #another, the discussions of dealers of carpets to the that have had to *entregarnos with the representatives of the governments *cuando treats  to look for finance for new priorities.
Without embargo, have to say that, to the contrary of it that *sucede in the national field, in *Europa have observed that the practical politics develops  above the parties and, in front of the material problems, the European Parliament is conscious of his responsibility, that of course increased  and happened to occupy an even more stood out place to the sight of the low participation in the #european elections.
#Such as it establishes the article 35 of our Regulation, the Commission of Control Budgetary, competent for this matter, listened and interrogated individually to the candidates proposed the days 22. And 23 November 1999. In said audiences, *nos guide, on the one hand, by the disposals of the Treaty, that demand that the candidates form part or have formed part in the past of an organ of control of accounts or are especially qualified for the exercise of said charge.
From the point of sight of the countries in development, the important questions are the creation of the conditions to develop his capacity to register the indexes of pollution and the development of his capacities of performance in general, #as well as the promotion of the transfer of technology.
. (IN) In the first place, it wanted to recognise, to the equal that am safe that it recognises #all the Parliament, the paper that has exerted the distinguished deputy Mr. *Soares no only in the restoration of the democracy, the human dignity and the human rights in #one of the great countries of *Europa, but also the historical paper that has exerted at the end of the empire and in the conclusion of an empire with #all the #decorum that has been possible, without forgetting *Macao.
The second problem is, definitely, the most important: although it mentions  in the preamble, this text do not answers to an essential problem, *cual is the investigation directed to illnesses that are not little frequent, but concerning the *cuales do not exists market for the pharmaceutical industry, in particular the illnesses that affect to populations that #can not pay his treatment: it treats , especially, of the tropical illnesses, even of the malaria and of the tuberculosis.
Whereas the previous rounds carried out inside the greater discretion, among negotiators *sagaces and taking into account only the commercial interests of his country, the next round, #whose date of start is up to now unknown, only will be able to make in the transparency and integrating in the debates #all the questions linked with the trade, to know: the social norms, the environment, the protection of the consumers, the culture.
Subject: Granting of humanitarian help to Serbian Has the Council the intention to undertake initiatives directed to send humanitarian help to the #serbian village, now that the winter is in doors, since the maintenance of the embargo -on the that has manifested his reservations even the coordinator of the Pact of Stability, Mr. *Bodo *Hombach- affects to the #serbian village in greater measure that to the diet of *Milosevic?
Of here that it value very positively the Report *Murphy and that it have voted in favour of #the same by what said report introduces again looks that the Council had deleted when elaborating his common position, but that represent an unquestionable benefit for the #SME, in particular the obligation to fix by law the establishment of some same terms of collection in the commercial transactions and the that this obligation *incumba also to the public powers.
Given the importance of the tourism, by a part, regarding the creation of places of work and, by #another, regarding the diffusion of the #european culture and taking into account the constant postponement of the approval of the program in question by part of the Council of Ministers of Tourism, #can indicate the Council for when has foreseen  the definite approval of the program?
I create also that it is necessary to elaborate and draft this code of fine administrative behaviour that #would help so much to the Commission of Requests as to the Defender of the Village in his work. Help to the Defender of the Village and to the Commission of Requests in his work is not more that help to that the #european construction was more credible for the #european citizens.
It is by #this that, giving follow-up to the investigation of initiative carried out by the Defender of the Village on the procedures of infringement, the Commission has engaged  to facilitate, in #the same moment in that it informs to the author of a complaint of his intention of *archivarla -*cuando #this is the intention- also the reasons by the that estimates that it do not exists violation of the community Right.
*Me Give account that the politics and the Institutions have to involve in the situations that produce  and, by #this, when confirming my trial on the conflict, back any initiative directed to find a positive solution from the point of sight political, ethical and juridical, entrusting especially in the paper that the UN, the European Union, the NATO and *Rusia #can and have to exert.
Affirm that it gave  this deal to the Nations Joined because two permanent members of the Council of Security blocked the action of the NATO (#such as have right to take basing in the statute of the UN...), it is a monument to the arbitrariness and a dangerous sample of totalitarian logic, is to say, *acaso the Nations Joined are only useful *cuando agree with the NATO?
*Me Cheer especially that, in spite of the hit that has suffered lately the Commission -although the Mr. Commissioner is above #all this history- have not ceased to boost this so useful work in the sector of the financial services.
*Me Upset the words of the Mr. *Prodi, that seems more concerned for respecting the tradition of bulimia of power of the Commission, that for clearing how this last will apply the principles of prevention and of just trade (on the *cuales the next President of the Commission *calla) during the commercial negotiations in the that goes to represent the interests of the States members.
Gentleman President, the title sounds very promising, but, to my trial, the greater misfortune that suffer the greater persons in this moment -*yo *me include among *ellos- is the resignation of the Commission, since, as a result of *ella, the proposals of the Commissioner *Monti to elaborate a directive allocated to liberalise the market of the bottoms of pensions will remain  in the inkwell by long.
We identify also like signals of identity of a progressive politics the protection of the environment integrated in #all the community politics and the review of the ceiling of the own resources in the financial perspectives of the Diary 2000, #as well as the maintenance of the internal solidarity of the Union through his structural Bottoms and of cohesion.
We have initiated this path: it has begun shyly the path of the harmonisation of the economic politics; the Mr. Commissioner *Monti has elaborated a project for the harmonisation of the fiscal politics that will have to be approved, and in the next European Council of Colony will tackle  the subject of the European Pact by the Employment.
These agreements, for the time being, more that a liberalisation have caused a concentration of the market in hands of some #few multinationals that have imposed a system of control *monopolístico; after the agreements *GATT have not fulfilled  the clauses of protection of the environment, of the health, ethical and of defence of the most disadvantaged villages of the world.
Also I support the request by part of the speaker of investment public/private to achieve a modern infrastructure of transports and communications in the Union and also his request to the Commission and to the Council so that they find the mechanism of finance appropriate, as, for example, an enlargement of the paper of the *BEI.
Any solution of #alto the fire that do not regulate unambiguously this look will not be able to achieve, to my seem, a true #alto the fire. The return of the refugees has to go accompanied, in effect, of the deployment of a strength of peace solid with a strong participation of the NATO, but also of neutral countries, of *Rusia and of other countries.
When encouraging the secession of the #Kosovar of tongue #albanian, that no always have been *exentos of exactions, justifies  with hindsight precisely *aquello that wanted to condemn  and, in particular, to the Government of *Milosevic, because although the #albanian claims on *Kosovo are legitimate in name of the rights of an ethnic majority, in this case *Milosevic has foundation to demand for Serbian the annexation of the *Krajina Croat, populated in his majority by #serbian, or the annexation of a part of *Bosnia, equally populated in part by #serbian.
I believe that the crisis of *Kosovo shows to #that that did not want to recognise it that need a ministry and a minister of Subjects External, a ministry and a minister of Defence and Security, and that already is hour that it endow  to *Europa of the necessary instruments to reach said goal in ten or fifteen years, as *Europa knew to take it takes ten or fifteen years in the case of the Economic and Monetary Union.
But it will be necessary the improvement of the judicial system, of the public administration, of the strengths of police and of the regional authorities by means of the training, the support to the reforms, the strengthening of the relations among the political means Europeans and Russians, #as well as of support to the *ONG and to the independent social media.
Inside the socialist Group there #be the one who thinks that yes there #be a reasonable base of negotiation and that it is *eso it that we have to take. No only by the media, no only by the public opinion, no only by the constituents, but to be in peace with *nosotros same and show that *cuando talk in name of the villages of *Europa, in name of the democratic constituents, have a minimum affinity with the common persons and that we have to put end to a series of practices, what before, better.
The want to have available, anyway, before the first reading of the European Parliament, because #if we #would not be in hands of the Council, *cuando treat  of the additional means that will put  really to disposal for the category 5. Because #if the notification gets after the first reading by part of the Parliament, then only will be able to  make the rectification #if both parts of the Authority of Budgets, or was the Council and the Parliament, approve it.
Second: in this statutory page of a report that never have signed, puts that today in the meeting, on 4 May the President of the European Parliament has announced the confirmation of the common position and that has transacted this common position to the Commission of transport and Tourism, like corresponding commission.
#If it takes into account that in the year 1998 the disasters called «natural» -*yo no the #would consider always natural- have caused 50.000 dead persons and 12, 4 trillions of pesetas in losses (floods, fires, hurricanes -like the *Mitch- or environmental catastrophes -always memory *Doñana, that follows *coleando and with problems-) has taken  indispensable that the organisations of protection civil play an important paper in each #one of these disasters, especially #if said organisations work well, his integral are very formed and at the same time form part of a network of cooperation community.
His goal is to offer, on the one hand, a commitment among having uniform requirements and, by #another, facilitate the access of the European Union to the world-wide markets approximating the industrial specifications of the European Union to the widest requirements established in the Regulation of 1995 of the Economic Commission for *Europa of the Nations Joined.
It has chaired during #one of the most extraordinary periods of the history of the European Union and of the life of this Parliament, as *usted same has said in his intervention: splitting of the Conference *Intergubernamental, happening by the introduction of the euro and until the unexpected process of ratification of the new Commission, of the that also *nos have occupied, although it was not in the calendar neither expected to take it.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, in the Congress of The there #be in 1998, the #european movement regretted that the Union seemed today condemned to advance in a big conceptual gap and appeared *desprovista of any political perspective, precisely in the moment in that it is launching  to the two great adventures of his history: the only coin and the enlargement.
I believe that it is important to stand out that the structural Bottoms, with his downward profile of costs, represent an important contribution to the consolidation of the budget. It guarantees  the community solidarity to the highest level of the last period of the helps, is to say, the level of helps of 1999 for the regions of structures feebler.
In his moment voted in favour of the investiture of #Jacques *Santer for the Presidency of the Commission, considering that it had been the Prime minister of a small country like the #mine, but much less affected by the immigration *extraeuropea, by the unemployment and by the taxes, giving the voice of #alert for having accepted at the front of the different departments to the worst and to the best.
We underline also the importance that the Roman President *Prodi attributes to the #mediterranean politics, that plants in a similar plane to the of the enlargement to the SIN, his will to contribute to a greater dynamism of the #european economy and to a reduction of the unemployment and, thing for *nosotros essential, the defence of the economic and social cohesion.
And it that it is more important, for me personally, the jewel of the crown reached as a result of the back informal negotiations to *Berlín in *Estrasburgo was that the Council gave his approval to the appeal of the European Parliament to modify the decision of the Summit of *Berlín to add a new initiative *URBAN with the 0, 35 % of the bottoms added to the community batch.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, lady Commissioner, gentleman Commissioner, the repercussions of the basic agreement on the agricultural reform «Diary 2000» on the agriculture in the European Union and on the agricultural incomes, are less negative that in the primitive proposals of the Commission since the reductions of prices have resulted lower in the cereals and the meat of *vacuno.
Subject: Free circulation of persons in the EU So as to prevent his participation in a demonstration (authorised) on 27 March in #París, the #french authorities blocked to 3000 Italians in the border the night of 26 March. This grave fact violates the right of demonstration and the freedom of circulation in the European Union
For example, a proposal to fund #the same measure with charge to the *IFOP for the regions of the Goal 1 and 2 but with charge to the sector of guarantees of the *FEOGA for other regions #can not encourage more that the «hunting of bottoms», in the that the companies of the sector *pesquero #can go back to establish  in the Community with the simple goal to endorse the bottoms for a determined project.
The bad news is that an overwhelming majority of the commission has criticised and even has protested with vehemence against the form and the method in that said decisions and disposals have seen the light. I expect that this Assembly add  to our complaints, since *revisten a special importance in it that to the parliamentary control and the *codecisión of the Parliament in the field of the inner security refers .
On the other hand, it wanted to signal that as a result of this behaviour of the Council arises once again the doubt of #if the theory of the *legitimación indirect of the Council like legislator in terrains so crucial follow being sustainable to these heights. As no only the European Parliament proceeds to the debate without having of the corresponding documentation, no only the European Parliament remains  to the *margen of the decisions and the *preparativos of the Council, but that have proof that also the national Parliaments are informed late and badly.
It is not correct, in the first place, because it did not exists absolute majority, as *usted same had signalled it on purpose of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 17 July 1998 on the external politics and of common security, agreement to the that *yo *me there was opposite together with my Group; and, second, it is not correct because it did not exists any type of ratification by the national Parliaments of texts that add, modify or complete the Treaties, often of substantial way.
In effect, the amendments incorporated to the proposal of the Commission, and that the Council affirms to be had to accept, improve noticeably the access to the information on procedures of community decision too much secret, well treat  of the committees, of the documents that argue , of the agendas, of the list of participants, or well -even-of the calendar of the works of the committees.
On this false base, the resolution of the European Parliament, that tackles especially the preparatory works of the future reform, proposes that the Commission initiate -and afterwards direct- the process, and that, without abandoning his supposed political responsibility, entrust the editorial of a *primer document to a group of experts, formula that already used  in the preparation of *Maastricht.
But I want to signal that the placing of #all the process of query electoral under the responsibility of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined will force necessarily to an intervention of strengths of appropriate security, #if Indonesian did not fulfils with his duty to disarm to the militias and watch by that the process pass without interference of the terrorist groups and armed.
I have had the honour to take part this week in three occasions, in my last apparition in front of this Parliament, to talk about the freedom and of the peace in *Kosovo, in favour of the efforts of the EU in his fight against the pity of death and in favour of a court for the crimes of war.
And with arrangement to this opinion and had account that the Mr. *Anwar #Ibrahim already has happened almost seven months in the prison without having the possibility to resort to a bail, the Commission considers that the process, that the appeal of the lawyers of the defence already announced, has to carry out with arrangement to the criteria accepted internationally to consider a trial like just.
A high level of nuclear security is a priority of the process of adhesion, and the Commission is had to cooperate with #all the States candidates to help to improve the nuclear security, guaranteeing that the levels of security technological and of operation adjust  to the practices, at present valid in the Union in matter of security.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0226/99) of the Mrs. *Lulling, for the Delegation of the Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation, on the Regulation (*CE) of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the statistics of the exchanges of sakes among States members so as to reduce the data that have to provide (3608/99 - *C4-0172/99-97/0155(*COD))
Thus *le invite to that, of compliance with the article 38 of the Regulation (statements to explain decisions of the Commission), ask to the Commission, *cuando finish the agenda of today, that avenges to this hemicycle to explain the decision that took  yesterday to impose to the French Federation of Football a fine by a quantity *irrisoria of 650 pounds by a clear violation of the community norms.
To #all #that that are in favour of a politics of peace preventive -on it that exists a wide consensus in the national Parliaments and in the European Parliament- by #everything it that has not reached *Dayton -it that did not supposes a criticism to *Dayton, as probably then did not exist another possibility-, want *decirles that a strategy of approach on a long-term basis for the *Sudeste of *Europa to the *Europa of the integration to integrate  to continuation really in *ella, has converted  now in operative politics.
Regarding the considerations of party, is evident that the Commission has to represent the great political strengths of the European Union and that in the level of the Parliament will have to follow practising with #all the great Groups -and did not treats  only of two Groups- a politics of cooperation necessary to carry to term our legislative work.
It suffice to remember the paper that had the Mr. *Bangemann in the proposal reviewed of the Commission on the rights of author and the society of the information, the pressures that carried out #Telephone to introduce changes in the proposal of directive previously refused by the Parliament, the active politics of #Telephone of face to achieve penetrate in the means, and even in relation with the rates.
Also it #would say that the Mr. *Kreissl-*Dörfler had reason in insisting, together with the Mr. *Duff -in a *primer speech very interesting-in that #if #all the institutions do not show the highest levels of *rectitud for himself/hisself same, and by himself/hisself same, the criteria will be imposed from out, well in form of punishment by part of the public opinion, in principle by means of his apathy and *desinterés, but perhaps of other more direct ways, also political, or well that the Council assume a responsibility that #others do not seem to be had to show.
Therefore, I believe that the Commission has applied wrongly the article 82 of the Treaty, because in this case did not treat  to take advantage of  *abusivamente of a dominant position, but to benefit , of an absolutely just and comprehensible way, of a very particular situation from the point of sight fiscal.
First, the Committee of Experts Independent recognises that, although the last responsibility of the management *recae in the Commission, did not fits to ignore that the administrations of the States members execute at least the 80% of the community budget and that his attitude in front of the fraud is not always diligent although afterwards these ministers are the that *despotriquen against the community management.
Also with regard to #this, to my opinion, *nos find in front of a true fraud, because undress of authority to the free will of some persons that organise  on the base of an article of the Regulation, is not an act of democracy and of freedom; before well, #if a deputy thought that this act has inspired  only in it that it is the economic budget of the groups and of the assistants, then *nos find in front of an authentic case of fraud.
But the question that it #would be necessary to take is #if it will not have got the moment that, #if the European Community wants to have protected sure enough his financial interests, exist a penal community Right that allow to configure like community offence, with a competent penal jurisdiction, the fraud against the financial interests of the Community.
In *tercer place, #if the Commissioner of Agriculture designated also loans greater attention to the amendments presented by the Parliament and to the own members of parliament, always that #that, just is to say it, no *rebasen the budgetary limits and do not derogate juridical acts already existent, the majority opinion of my Group is that the experience, competition and commitment of the candidate allow to conclude that it will make a fine work like member of the Commission.
Without embargo, a part of our group do not expects of the Commission an ecological approach in his performances, and from now on #all our group will commission  that the Commission respect the principle of development sustainable and make possible the creation of a *Europa of the citizens, so that both goals are always present to the hour to take decisions.
The Ministers of Justice and Inner will elaborate the subjects of his competition in an unofficial meeting that will celebrate  in *Turku the days 16 and 17 September, and the Council of Subjects General began the *preparativos of the European Council in a meeting that took place the past Monday, for *cerrarlos definitively in his meeting of the 11 to 12 October.
Report (To5-0013) of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the Council (*COM(1999)312 - *C5-0062/1999 - 1999/0123(*CNS)) by the that it modifies  the Regulation (*CE) *nº 1628/1996, of 25 July 1996, relative to the help to *Bosnia and *Herzegovina, *Croacia, the Federative Republic of *Yugoslavia and the ancient Yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia and, especially, by the that it creates  the European Agency of Reconstruction
Inform (To5-0013/99) of the Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of Regulation (*CE) of the Council (*COM(1999) 312 - *C5-0062/1999 - 1999/0132(*CNS)) relative to the modification of the Regulation (*CE) 1628/96 relative to the help to *Bosnia-*Herzegovina, *Croacia, Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and to the ancient #yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia, mainly by the creation of a European Agency of Reconstruction
In *tercer place, in terms of economic support and support to the development, the commitment of the Commission in the frame of the Agreement of *Lomé #can and #would have to be reactivated with two conditions: in the first place, an improvement of the situation of the security in the *RDC and, second, a result of the national debate that guarantee a stable political disposal in the *RDC and in the that respect  the fundamental elements of the Agreement of *Lomé.
Of the recent past and of his *productivismo *descabellado inherit a situation that, in the common agricultural field - with *demasiada frequency -, has put the politics to the service of the great economic groups *agroalimentarios and of the distribution on a large scale. Result: crazy cows, chickens that poison "to the dioxin" , oil of casting in the oil for the consumption, muds of purification in the flours for the livestock, and do not quote more...
*Algo Very distinct to Big *Bretaña: it has not produced  eradication of the illness and the tax of animals ailing situates  still in a too much elevated level to avert any risk of pollution and to guarantee to the consumers a healthy product.
We will have to organise, therefore, a big conference on the AIDS, but without *dejarla only in hands of the countries that afterwards have to manage specifically some so dramatic consequences, but a conference, as *auguramos from takes years, in 1993, on the pandemias, the AIDS, that under our responsibility face up to this situation and arbitrate measures that correspond to an international authority, to the sight that the WHO is totally unable to offer concrete answers.
The answer of the Parliament in the form elaborated by the Commission of Budgets is that it important in this stage is to review the financial perspectives and of this form ensure also in fact the arrival to destination of the general assistance given by the Parliament and by the European Union #as well as the possibility to carry to good term these subjects.
The help to the scales of payments is a help to reinforce the reservations of a country of #such form that #can face up to his problems of payments external, that always have a compensation: always it pays  or by the provision of a service or by the acquisition of a commodity.
Thus, I give my approval, of course, to the amendments presented by the gentleman *Langen that demand of the Commission a more active paper to boost a strategy of promotion coordinated in the breast of the States members #as well as to develop the potential of *Europa in the export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
The technical advances of the last years have improved clearly the efficiency of the sources of energy renewable, and in place to allocate *tantos resources to the #european atomic industry, as obviously it takes the Commission, owe *redoblarse the efforts for promoting the sources of energy renewable.
The *primer moment of *apogeo of this process of democratisation were the democratic elections of 1994, the first celebrated for #all the #south african, that constituted a visible expression of the release no only of the majority of the population until then *oprimida, but in reality also, create *yo, of the privileged by the ancient system; of his release of the pressure *autoimpuesta to have to justify a system that *ellos same knew, at least in his *fuero internal, that was *injustificable and that also *les was *distanciando progressively of the persons of *Europa and *Norteamérica with the that felt  cultural and ethnically identified.
There are other chapters like the tax on the value added that require some harmonisation because, of it contrary, #would distort  the competition; likewise they exist other chapters, to know, the tax of societies and the tax on performances of the capital furniture that, by the contrary, have to be harmonised in the part in that the fault of harmonisation involves a distortion of the competition.
The one who do not recognise now that has got the hour of the truth neither recognise that it has to give  a clear and sincere answer to *Turquía, will run the risk that it do not reach  all *aquello that want of *Turquía but that produce  a very different evolution of the that we will be also responsible in the case that *Turquía do not look for already the path to the family of the community of values democratic in *Europa but in any #another spot.
Finally, it do not leaves to be, definitely, interesting observe that the cooperation that seals  of this way with this big country of the South #can contribute to the creation of effects synergistic useful for the European Union in the frame of the delicate negotiations that go  to initiate in the breast of the *OMC, from the Conference of *Seattle of the next month of November.
In effect, a fault of control on our part #would have dramatic consequences for the society, gravely affected by the unemployment (40% of the active population) and #would go totally against of the efforts that the European Union makes from takes #a lot of years, through the structural Bottoms, to favour the economic and social development of the island.
But not even they have the value of #Emma *Tuahepa, the one who has  brave to ask to the #african governments it that had taken and it that are taking with the money of the #african, and it only that *ustedes have limited  to signal is that #any of the eleven Bosses of #african State  *dignó to assist to the Conference, or the importance of the cultural and religious factors in the propagation of the plague.
I think, for example, in an excessive *enfatización of the clauses of protection social, of the *dumping social there #where knows  perfectly that #this will be mere *declamaciones after the *cuales there will be swim more not even effective controls and that, in fact, only will be the sword of #Damocles protectionist for the countries in development, for the countries of recent industrialisation, that will be able to be used *cuando the old *Europa, the old *Europa of the bureaucracies, of the #sindical bureaucracies and of the industrial decadence, will find  with the water to the neck.
On 25 May 1999 the agreement was signed by the President of the Parliament, Mr. #Gil-Oaks, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission; the Council and the Commission adopted on 25 May and on 2 June, respectively, the timely decisions of his competition with seen to the application of the agreement in the breast of said Institutions.
It #would be suicidal, *contrariamente to it that #some have affirmed today, think that the #european rulers #can exert pressures so that the Central Bank *supla his inability to reactivate the economy through the structural reforms, the liberalisation of the markets, before #all the of work, and the budgetary rigour that it has to go accompanied of a reduction of the fiscal charge on the persons and the companies.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Central Bank European, *Señorías, this debate celebrates  *cuando have fulfilled  the first nine months of the life of the euro, in some conditions that allow to ensure that his introduction has been a hit, although it only was in the sense limited that the transition to the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union has produced  without greater *sobresaltos.
Another big difference is that it is very easy to try take a false note with modern technicians of photocopied it that constitutes the reason by the that the precise details of the notes go to be given to know amply but only little before his introduction to reduce the risk of the fake and not confusing to the public that is not even familiarised with the notes.
Our Group will take use of #all the means to his scope to influence in the community budgets so that they believe  the bases of a #european bottom for the refugee; subject #this, that now only went object of quotation in the decisions of the Council, urging to the Commission to study the possibility to " consider the creation of *algún bottom of reservation for situations, in the that great groups of refugees need temporary protection."
A strong signal of *Tampere that *Europa has left to be only a market and that the #european citizen no longer is only a consumer and a worker; that the citizen, whereas citizen, with #all his dimensions, with #all his worries, with #all his needs, with #all his demands, is in the centre of the #european construction.
In this occasion will have to give  a clear signal so that the process of preparation of the Letter and the Conference *Intergubernamental of the Union, that will develop  simultaneously, express two convergent dynamics, with seen to guarantee the conditions of enlargement and strengthen the foundations of the State of right in our Union of right.
Still they do not circulate the notes of the #european coin and, watches by where, already talked  in June, in Colony, of a #european army and, in September, in *Tampere, of a #european penal justice, is preparing  a Letter of Rights Fundamental and, finally and especially, the Commission asks to the European Council that accept the perspective of a *Europa expanded until the #Asia Lower and until the western borders of the *Irak and of the will go.
Report (To5-0021/1999) of the Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of the Commission of Politics Regional, Transports and Tourism, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the regional politics, of the transports and of the tourism (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219/1999)
Have to confess -already with #any experience in the relations among the European Parliament and the Congress of the States Joined- that in the Congress of the States Joined have #a lot of friends and speakers, but that have not been able to board in any moment a positive debate with the senator *Helms, that seems that it do not has not even of North American passport and that considers, no only in this subject but in #others #many, that *él is the that imposes his law to the world.
Gentleman President, wish to support the program Culture 2000 and congratulate to the speaker, the Basque Mr. *Graça *Moura, for having enriched the group of the text with new contributions directed, by a part, to achieve greater participation of the countries and of the *beneficiarios and, by #another, to insist on the need to diversify the announcements, #as well as with his recommendations in defence of the deconcentration of the activities and great cultural events.
More specifically, regarding the agricultural chapter of the budget, is evident that even before they begin the negotiations *multilaterales of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the EU proposes  coordinate with the North American the reduction of the protection and of the interventions, by means of the reduction of the resources allocated to the different agricultural products, fact that comports new reductions in the income of the producers and new limitations to the crops.
The Managerial Committee European Scientist has to pronounce on the relevance of the #french arguments since the Monday, the group *ad *hoc that gathers to the #european specialists of the illnesses of *priones has not been able to get to an unanimous conclusion and has transmitted to the Scientific Committee European the results of his works.
It #would suit *conmigo in that the relative situation to the meat of bovine has contributed now, in front of the public opinion, to create the chaos regarding the *aceptabilidad of the trials issued in the #european level on the *inocuidad of the foods and that *eso do not presages at all good for the plan of the Mr. *Prodi to create a #european agency of alimentary security?
#If #this do not locate  and are not recognised like the real causes of the problems to the that they confront  the workers of the sea, #can not  talk neither of measures neither of the creation of mechanisms of control, for example of the rest of the workers of the sea, that only #can give of ineffective form and *hipócrita, perpetuating like this the diet of intensification of the work and of the exploitation.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0049/1999) of the Mr. *Gahrton, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Popular Republic of Chinese [*COM(1999)0287 - *C5-0038/1999 - 1999/0123(*CNS)]
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0045/1999) of the Mr. *Linkohr, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council [*COM(99) 0292 - *C5-0040/99 - 99/0125(*CNS)] by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Argentinian Republic.
In the main document *nos likes in particular -as to #others- the insistence in the need of a coherent approach of the regulation of the network Internet and of the electronic trade and also in the intellectual property, the sale to distance and the protection of data, looks collected, #all *ellos, to protect the rights of the consumers and guarantee suitable norms of feasibility.
Therefore, the goals consist, first, in establishing in #all the European Union and in #all the countries applicants, networks of communication among the organisations that occupy  to struggle against the violence exerted on the women and the boys, as these organisations are the that know the field; second, in creating consciousness among #all the Europeans about the nature of this bad and of the need to eradicate it and to allocate bottoms to *ello.
In this report underlined also the need that we promoted the celebration of an exceptional European Council on the future of the familiar politics and of protection of the infancy in the European Union, and that it presented  to the Parliament a comparative annual report of the legislations of our countries in this subject.
Regarding the amendments, have to say that the European Commission has accepted fully nine, has accepted 7 of *ellas of entrance; but we have not advanced more and it #would want to explain why: During the #finnish Presidency, that as *ustedes know is responsible to boost the complementary directives and the planning of the semester, gave  a strategic option that had communicated  to the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects.
#If there #be not resulted until finals of year, my intention is, in the #portuguese Presidency, introduce a change of strategy, a distinct approximation to the problem and a base of negotiations distinct, to boost said managerial with steps faster and, explaining already with a first reaction of the Council, that the Commission advance in the new approximation, that #would say that it is *algo easy.
More that some words, #would want simply ask, like witness alas very near, that further of the message of compassion -and is truth that the families of the victims will appreciate it- #can, in our quality of Parliament European, initiate a procedure of solidarity by means of helps that #can attribute to this region of the big South so *duramente affected, in favour of the families, first, and afterwards of #that that have lost it all, without embargo also in it that touches to the economic instrument that has remained destroyed.
I share also the point of sight that a just configuration of the budget #can not make exclusively in the side of the income of the budget and share also the opinion that it do not is necessary to expect until the year 2006 to keep a debate on the reform but that it has to make with his support inside this period of term of office.
Also it signals  in this resolution -and is perhaps the most important point, the section 4- that ask this Plenary that approve  the decision to increase the amount of the project of budget *rectificativo and supplementary 5/99 in 25 millions in credits of payment allocated to the program *PHARE, in consonance, lady *Schreyer, with the urgent needs of this program that *nos has signalled the Commission.
In *Europa have to take our contribution and give good example to the rest of the world, even recognising that the greater pressure for the energetic consumption in the future will owe  to countries like the States Joined, that is quite *despilfarrador in his consumption of energy, and also to the countries in development that, to measure that his economies grow and increase his level of life, go to need a greater energetic consumption, that probably will proceed of sources of energy quite *contaminantes.
The unitary confrontation of the #european citizens on the familiar differences and the questions that accompany to the custody of the boys in case of divorce is clear that go to avert to thousands of families the tiredness and the complications with the bureaucracy and also will reinforce the feeling of security and of confidence of the citizens in the European Union.
These two instruments constitute #one of the first stones of the community building that are building, #whose fundamental goal is the to offer to #all the citizens and to the juridical agents of the Union an easier access, faster and more effective to the justice like *salvaguardia of the norms of security juridical.
Subject: Application of the directive on the nitrates Is conscious the Commission (and are it in particular the responsible commissioners of environment and agriculture) that the #european directive on the nitrates (91/676/*CEE) do not offers absolute guarantees by it that refers  to the quality of the subterranean waters, seen that the directive centres  in the pertinent nitrates of *abonos of animal origin, leaving like this sideways other sources of nitrates?
I do not try to hide the military dimension of the security, but #where more hurts is, to my trial, in this continuous strategy to see  *obnubilada by the military look in detriment of a politics *paneuropea of prevention of the conflicts that was to the measure of the tensions and the fractures of the cold #postwar period in our continent.
We have heard with relief this morning the taking of position very firm of the gentleman #Solana on this subject and the commitment that has assumed to exert #all his influence this afternoon in *Estambul so that in this territory respect  the international right and the of the persons, and with relief finish of *oírle say, gentleman Commissioner *Patten, that will go immediately to add on the terrain his efforts to the of the gentleman #Solana.
It takes fault a European Parliament general legislator of the Union, like the Council, that take part of right plenary in the designation of the members of the other Institutions and able to establish a relation of confidence with the European Commission that no longer will see  weakened by the double majority qualified today necessary for the motion of censorship.
I demand that have true capacity of decision in it referred to the fundamental looks of the common politics of fishing and the regulations of base, for example in the field of the organisation of the market, the conservation and the exploitation of the resources *pesqueros, the measures of control and the instruments of the structural politics. #This calls  *codecisión of the Parliament.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0066/1999) of the Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the Office of Fight against the Fraud (*OLAF).
#One, the speaker of the Commission of Control Budgetary, the Mrs. *Theato, that is a bit the mother of the *OLAF and of #all this regulation; the #another, to the that consider the father of the current regulation, is the Mr. *Napolitano, that has had a big *mesura, a big intelligence and, especially, #a lot of prowess to the hour to confront a difficult solution.
It #would have to be compulsory that there was a greater coherence among the norms that govern the trade, the work, the environment, the animal welfare and other norms of acceptance international and the principles of the "fine management of societies" by means of a better cooperation among the *OMC, the *OIT, the Nations Joined, the agreements *multilaterales environmental and other international institutions.
#Such as it had required it the president *Pasqua during the general debate that took place in the Plenary at the beginning of October, and as it finishes to remember it *pertinentemente my colleague #Georges *Berthu, before initiating a new cycle of negotiations is indispensable to make a clear and precise balance, goal, therefore independent and contradictory, with the end to perceive the economic consequences, social, environmental and of alimentary security of the previous agreements of the Round *Uruguay.
Under the threat of the delay of the enlargement or even of the dissolution of the Union, by his own creators, in the attempt, without rules neither laws, for conquering new markets and deliver the booty, the capital *monopolista treats to surpass his internal contradictions, that were and follow being important, with #such to serve to the common interest of *sobreexplotar to the workers and obtain the maximum benefit.
In spite of the positive measures that adopted  after the resolution of this Parliament, in the past day 16 September, in particular the entrance of the international strength of peace and security with the *égida of the Nations Joined, the *INTERFET, the situation in matter of humanitarian security follow being grave so much in the territory of *Timor Oriental, #where is essential that get means to support the reconstruction, as in the case of the wall of 250.000 displaced by force to Indonesian, in particular to the western part of *Timor.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the succession of seisms that have seeded the destruction in the northwest of *Turquía *nos has moved to consider essential the reinforcement of the assignments for this country and, therefore, vote *favorablemente, in first reading, a review of the financial perspectives that establishes a support of emergency to *Turquía, to the pair with the priority that concede to the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
In accordance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0053/1999) of the Mr. *Medina *Ortega, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, on the proposal of regulation (*CE) of the Council by the that it modifies  the Regulation (*CEE) *nº 1911/91 relative to the application of the disposals of the community Right in the Canarian islands (*COM(1999) 0226 - *C5-0127/1999 - 19990111(*CNS))
Have known that an American dockyard -that did not build ships from took more of forty years- has received the commission to build two transatlantic fuselages allocated to the service of communication of the islands *Hawai, since the American law reservation to the dockyards of his country the construction of the crafts that make inner transports.
Although it has decided  renounce openly to the dockyards, the most recent events in *Corea of the South #can conduct to that in the Union begin  to confuse the old forms of support to the dockyards and the measures of the guidelines of1997 #whose goal is not the politics of competition, but simply the of a politics according to the doctrine of the stable development and of *safety *of *the are.
Also I have tried to convince to the aspiring countries of the importance of these subjects *diciéndoles that, although no #all the subjects are in the list of negotiations, #can be that #this wake up so much interest in the Parliaments of the States members, that the best form to ensure  a fast integration is to begin to work with time to resolve these questions, that, nevertheless, will earn big importance *cuando consumes  the adhesion.
I take advantage of this occasion for *pedirle to *usted, to the President of the Parliament, to the Presidency in exercise of the Council, to the Commission, an urgent initiative to take a call to the States Joined so that they suspend the execution of *Derek #Rocco *Bernabei, because the battle against the pity of death is a battle of *civismo that it has to rid always that it was precise and in #all the possible forms.
Today we have debated with the Presidency in exercise of the Council and with the President of the Commission the problems that pose , the proposals that has taken the European Commission in the frame of his report to the summit of *Helsinki and also regarding the attitude that presumably goes to follow the Council of ministers.
By this reason precisely, not to give a hit to the strengths that struggle today by the democracy, to send a message of solidarity to the *represaliados, a message of pressure by the authentic democratisation of the diet, *les invite to not voting these two proposals, or, at least, to *devolverlas to the Commission, until *Turquía give concrete samples of democratisation and of respect to the international right.
To the sight of the transformations that is experiencing the sylviculture in my country, in the sense of a reduction of the natural spaces, of a massive decrease of the demand of plants and also of a fault of resources public, *me see forced to signal this fact.
Some that the system of payments in great operations has worked very well, whereas -and #all agree- the problem of the excessive commissions in the current moment in the changes is generating a negative environment, because had some expectations of improvement in the cost of the changes of coin during this period, expectation that has not seen  fulfilled.
Also I celebrate that the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer have toughened in his report the requirements regarding that there are data easily accessible and comprehensible of #such form that the public opinion keep  informed in any moment of the quality of the air and of the possible problems of pollution derived of the dangerous broadcasts.
The Liberal give our compliance in the final vote to the common resolution, but affirm to #the same time that has not modified  the position in the question of the reform of the Treaties, of the preparation and execution of the conference *intergubernamental , #such as it has put  of self-evident in his behaviour of vote on the Report *Dimitrakopoulos/*Leinen.
Also there was another reason *circunstancial, the self-evident inability by part of some delegations to engage  with a true process of negotiation of the agenda and, from this point of sight, it is necessary to ask #if it was lucky the coincidence of the inauguration of the conference with the of the beginning of the electoral campaign in the States Joined.
The common fundamental goal to the two programs consists in contributing to the progressive construction of #one *Europa of the knowledge, able to transmit to the youngsters and to the adults the qualifications and the necessary competitions to insert  in the market of the employment and, it that also is important and often forgets , in the society.
The relative measures to the conservation of the populations of fishes and to the control of the activities of the fishing have to be the content of the agreements signed in the frame of the regional organisations of fishing, and these organisations have to fulfil the functions of platform of the international cooperation.
And now, in the moment in that it has given  this step -and it is necessary to remember that the relation with *Turquía did not comes of yesterday, comes of 1963-, *nosotros expect that *Turquía also know to answer of positive way, so much in his process of democratisation internal as also in his relations, no only with the Community, but fundamentally with the country that has given the most important step that believe that it is necessary to hail: #Grecia and his Government.
It is likewise evident, without embargo, that the enlargement in the terms foreseen did not allows neither the immediate realisation of a common external politics neither the definition of a project of politics economic, although this last was extremely urgent, also to the sight of the rise of the dollar with regard to the euro and of the disappointing results of *Seattle.
In said document that traces back to the month of October of this year aims , among other things, that so as to guarantee the global and sustainable competitiveness of the industries of the European Union based in the sylviculture or related with #the same, will be precise to guarantee some surroundings that boost the competition and boost the adaptation of the industry of the European Union to a competition more *aguerrida.
I am not economist, am civil engineer; but I want to underline the exceptional work that the Mr. *Bourlanges and his *coponentes have made, and expect that *nos help in a debate to evaluate notable subjects, to end to be able to judge, with the results in the hand, in how measured materialises the Commission the political decisions expressed in the budgets and did not has, at the end, other pertinent consequences of his application.
Seen that now we have been debating very thoroughly the Budget 2000 and the Parliament wanted to mark some criteria so as to that in the zones affected by the war, as for example in the *Balcanes, make  a planning *plurianual of the finance, #would have to adopt with greater frequency this optics, instead of *dispersarnos excessively in small programs and isolated projects, that do not allow an effective control and that represent some costs of personnel upper to the really necessary for the goals that wish  achieve.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0081/1999) of the Mr. *Valdivielso of *Cué, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of regulation (*CE, *Euratom) of the relative Council to the granting of assistance to the New Independent States and to *Mongolia in his effort of reform and economic recovery (*COM(1998) 753 - *C4-0038/1999 - 1998/0368(*CNS)).
The past week knew  that the Commission, that had to pronounce on a package of helps of the #british Government, thought to answer to this need that the plant purchase a world-wide scope, has *postergado his decision once again, and this delay affects to the confidence of the consumers and to the future of the factory.
*Limitándome To the last events in the Council, the #finnish Presidency has prepared a form directed to #all the countries members and to #all the #european institutions on the subject "The women in the processes of decision" #whose answers have made possible to the #finnish Presidency the editorial of a report that contains nine indicators and #some recommendations.
Recommendation (To5-0079/1999) of the Mr. *Bodrato, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement on the establishment of regulations technical world-wide applicable to the vehicles of tyres and to the squads and pieces that #can mount or use in said vehicles ("parallel Agreement ") (10167/1999 - *COM(1999)27 - *C5-0073/1999 - 1999/0011(*AVC))
Now *nos gets the news that the connection of the computer system of the European Parliament in *Bruselas with Internet will not be available among 22 December and on 4 January: #this involves for the #european deputies the prohibition, the absolute impossibility to work among 22 December and on 4 January in his dispatches in *Bruselas.
It #can indicate the Council #if it has posed  this subject during the contacts among the EU and the countries that have expressed his wish of *ingresar in the Union? How measured thinks to propose with the end that it limit  the uncontrolled flow of economic refugees to the EU, that has clear secondary effects of economic and social type (for example, increase of the criminality) in his States members?
On the other hand, #if the Community endorses with his true budgets types of credits of the European Bank of Investments, for example, the credits of projects that make  in third countries, the Council has stipulated that in these cases the *BEI has to deliver an annual report, so much to the European Parliament as to the Council, on the measures that have carried out with the credits endorsed by the budgets.
According to the article 255 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community, the Council and the Parliament, in a term of two years after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, have to ratify in procedure of *codecisión the general principles on the access to the documents and the pertinent limitations in plough of the private interest or public.
Then, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing will be able to take into account, with *algo of fine will by his part our amendments and adopt the legal text to the sight of #the same, Propose that we vote on the Report *Papayannakis and that *usted choose the sharpest feather that have in his arsenal and write to the Council in name of the Parliament, with the hope that the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing no pass without more by #alto it that agreed  yesterday, but that take into account our amendments.
It is not *usted of agreement *conmigo in that the absence of a price *transfronterizo *vinculante, or well his suppression, comports, especially for the small companies -and with *ello go back to the subject of the employment-, the risk that the national systems remain without effect owing to the big volume of the imports; the risk of disappearance of the small bookshops, especially in the half rural and in the small cities, and that with *ello reduce  the accessibility?
And *nos find precisely in this debate. Thus *le invite to define with clarity the notable market in this context like a linguistic and cultural space; to that it clear the existence of the clause of import beside the possibility to dictate a rule to national level, and to that it resort to the #french Right in his decision and in his considerations.
From the point of sight of the Commission, only will be able to surpass the regional tensions and the claims of greater autonomy or of independence #if in Indonesian establishes  a diet, a system that guarantee sure enough a clear political responsibility and the transparency in the direction of the State and that fulfil the wishes of the big majority of the citizens and citizen, of clear democratic ascription.
The European Union wait that #this mean a correct deal #as well as a public process, the respect of the norms of a State of right in front of an independent Court, access to a defence of his election and the permission of observers international to the process.
In the conclusions to the that got the European Council in the meeting of *Viena in December of 1998, stands out  among other things that the euro goes to strengthen the capacity of *Europa to promote the employment, the growth and the stability and that the introduction of the only coin will intensify the need of coordination economic.
Although the immense majority of the political strengths in *Eslovenia follows manifesting in favour of the goal of the adhesion to the European Union, #this no always seems to translate in a common impulse. The citizens do not seem involved fully in the attainment of said goal, as it shows it the fact that the campaign of information gives -and #this *me seems significant- the impression that finishes to begin and is *algo toneless.
The spheres to the that more takes  reference are the social security and the problems of pension that often arise *cuando a worker emigrates, the free circulation of persons, the recognition of the qualifications, the taxes included the VAT, the environmental questions and the questions of the welfare of the animals.
I will finish saying that, being as I am the only deputy of the European Parliament that has formed part *cabal and actively of the Commission of Requests of the European Parliament since it founded  in January of 1987, 12 years ago and half, expect that the members of the European Parliament chosen for the new Parliament achieve that it follow  respecting the right of the residents and #european citizens to present requests to the European Parliament.
Therefore, in the next term of office, perhaps was necessary to find a more agile method among the Commission of Requests, the European Commission and the States members, and demand to the States members that give immediate answer to the requirements of the Parliament and of the European Commission and that no *mareen the partridge -as we say in *España- with terms excessively long, because *eso #can have perverse effects.
Regarding the prudential norms, with regard to the *cuales the speaker proposes that the present Commission a report on the efficiency of the norms at present in vigour, believe that the recent crises and the form in that the European Union has faced up in general to these crises, show the substantial goodness of these prudential norms.
This tragedy illustrates, besides, by #if it was necessary, the absolute need to control the influx of circulation by road -especially of the heavy vehicles-, to promote the rail traffic and to establish the norms of operation that guarantee the maximum security in the breast of a #european market of transports sufficiently diversified.
The report of the Mr. *Herman on the improvement of the operation of the institutions without modifying the Treaties constitutes the complement of another report approved the past year, allocated to the practical actions with regard to reducing the democratic deficit in the management of the economic and monetary union.
Regarding the inclusion of #Venecia in the goal 2, fits to signal that in the proposal of the relative Commission to the application during the period 2000-2006 of the new goal 2 of the structural Bottoms establishes  the responsibility shared among the Commission and the States members regarding the definition of the apt regions to perceive the helps.
Undoubtedly, that the *imputación was founded do not wants to say that the Mr. *Moniz was guilty, but for *eso are the courts and, in this case, the Mr. *Moniz, as #any one of *nosotros, has to understand that be representative of the #european citizens mean to be a citizen more in #everything it that *respecta to the responsibilities, and only in those looks in that it is in game the interest of the representation that has , has to have some true *salvaguardias against those who #can abuse, in detriment of the institution, in detriment of the Parliament, in detriment of the citizenship, of the procedural procedures.
The approval of the management governs  by the article 206 of the Treaty. The decision of the approval of the management conceived  like a mechanism of character *primordialmente financial that bases  in the report of the Court of Accounts, although it have purchased with the step of the years a political dimension.
*Le #Would invite rather to consider the problem in the following terms: with the current integration of the markets, #if there was not any form of coordination of the fiscal politics, in this case the States members yes that #would lose increasingly sovereignty in benefit of anonymous markets, and in this case #would have every time less possibilities to implant with efficiency a fiscal politics.
We have to find a cancellation; but also I am of the opinion that here it did not concede  the approval of the management, as #if we see the result of the vote of December, was clear that the previous points that motivated the agreement, that had been declared like positive report by the Commission of Control Budgetary, were refused by the Plenary.
In the countries of right #anglo-saxon, in the *cuales did not exists a Constitution, *me seems that the *rule *of *law is the cardinal principle that governs these better countries, more still, much better and that the has defended against this type of vision, according to the *cual in a moment given the majority #can decide all it that wants: they exist the laws and the texts, without embargo, did not matters, #can say  it contrary, is sufficient that want it the majority.
In general, it will be necessary to establish with clarity the political priorities, adapt the structures of the Commission to his future tasks, expand the decentralisation also in the field of the management of the resources, *racionalizar the works of the Commission and improve his efficiency, and finally, to my seem, also #would be necessary to adopt a code of behaviour for the Commissioners and the personnel.
His capacity to show that it has exerted a #worthy paper of the President of the Commission to the hour to decide #who have to form part of the commission and #which have to be his wallets are things, #all *ellas, that will give to his presidency and to his Commission his initial strong points and, in fact, will be able to *darle also his initial lean points.
Definitely it defends it *usted and definitely will encourage  *usted in *darle an impulse with the new Commission, to the equal that definitely will carry *usted to cape the political union and likewise will give to the European Union the means and the capacity to exert an important function in *Europa and in the world through his external politics and of common security.
And afterwards, #everything will go back to begin to final of year, since *cuando expire the mandate of the current Commission *dimisionaria, will have to request, once again, the confidence of the European Council and of the European Parliament by a mandate of five years, mandate that #can see interrupted in any moment by the vote of a motion of censorship that -like #all know-has left to be a theoretical hypothesis.
*Yo Believe that, knowing it occurred with the previous Commission, *usted will undertake the necessary institutional reforms and will tackle equally the relative looks to the personal responsibility, to the internal control and also to the financial control, to the improvement of the efficiency and to the right of control of the European Parliament regarding the Commission associated to #everything *ello.
In the next weeks and the next months also will have to define, of course, the roads to organise the interaction among the Commission and the European Parliament, in his quality of organ of control, included the presentation of reports and the obligation to inform to the commissions of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, personally regret deeply that the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer have proceeded of form so precipitated to the vote of the amendments of commitment to the report of the Mr. *Lannoye on the proposal of directive relative to the honey, that the final the has weakened.
Gentleman President, am safe that we will get to a prompt solution and here -and #this are my last words-, when taking the word by last time in this term of office in name of the Popular Party European for the reply to the Mr. *Rothley, *me comes to the memory a lovely speech of the parliamentarism *constituyente #spanish of the Constitution of 1812 in #where a member of parliament said to #another -and *yo create, gentleman *Rothley, that *usted deserves it - that it was #be and firm in the defence of the arguments and loyal with the opponent.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0190/99) of the Mrs. *Oomen-*Ruijten in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the commercialisation to distance of financial services allocated to the consumers and by the that modify  the Directives 90/619/*CEE, 97/7/*CE and 98/27/*CE (*COM(98)0468 - *C4-0647/98-98/0245(*COD))
the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the preparation of the European Council of the days 3 and 4 June in Colony; -the oral questions *B4-0334/99 and *B4-0335/99 of the Mr. Of #Giovanni, in name of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, to the Council and to the Commission respectively, on the institutional reform.
The Union has to have some modern norms of administration and transparency according to the #nordic model, with open meetings in the Council of Ministers, with a principle of advertising that give right to #all to know the public documents, with registers in #all the community institutions and with freedom of communication, #this is, right to inform to the means of information and to #others on errors or infringements in the administration.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, have got at the end of this debate on the Diary 2000, and tomorrow the Assembly will approve surely these regulations. *Yo Believe that, with these regulations, have reached an improvement of the economic and social cohesion, that is #one of the fundamental goals of the Union: an economic and social cohesion and a better territorial cohesion.
Subject: A just process for *Ocalan A common point in the positions of #all the institutional organs of the European Union on the subject *Ocalan is the requirement of the celebration of a just process *ypúblico, as this concept understands  in the juridical systems of the modern societies and civilised.
I #can not leave to manifest my *extrañeza in front of the fact that the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of this Parliament have refused an amendment presented by my Group to correct this situation, and that this amendment have been declared inadmissible to be voted in the Plenary, in application of the article 60 of the Regulation.
Second, because it has not recognised  the specificity of the #portuguese agriculture neither have expanded  the different types of quotas of production, in spite of that *Portugal is the country more *deficitario of the European Union, neither has considered  the possibility to increase the quotas of *regadío, that will be indispensable, since in *Portugal the *regadío is fundamental for the modernisation of his agriculture, the most retarded of the European Union.
In the conclusions remained reflected the priorities of the Assembly, and like condition *sine *qua *non to adopt a future agreement with this country, the clause of *condicionalidad or of human rights, the political dialogue and the parliamentary dialogue were priorities, #as well as the regional development, the social promotion, the attention to the women in situation of precariousness and a long #etcetera.
*Yo #Would say that in #all the sector of the electronic trade, of the electronic activities of the intellectual property, the electronic signature, in general all it relative to the services of the information, including the subjects of property intellectual, *nos are moving in a field in the that the national States  *nos have remained small.
It gives the consumers the opportunity to request the commercial information that wish; it gives to the *anunciantes the possibility to direct his messages to #that that wish *recibirlos; it gives to the providers of Internet, that provide access to the network, the possibility to follow providing a service of post electronic fast, effective and sure.
Although it remains a lot for taking in the new community market, have shown that it is possible to protect the interests of the employers, of the dealers, especially of the small and medium enterprises, and to #the same time, defend to the citizens in his condition of consumers, that are the goal and the end of the work of the so much public companies like private.
As until the Monday was not possible to vote the corresponding amendments and as a result of *ello *usted *nos authorised to celebrate an exceptional meeting, since the conversations *tripartitas had not taken place until the week before and went then *cuando knew the results of the Council, the Commission of Budgets adopted the amendments that adjusted  to the main decision immediately after the vote of #the same.
It has not passed neither a year since the Parliament ratified the provisional agreement splitting of the base that the clause of rights human that contained #would put to proof the seriousness of the Government *mejicano to the hour to guarantee that the cooperation in matter of human rights was essential in the relations with the EU.
Gentleman President, the European Parliament has supported unambiguously the cause of the village *timorense and his inalienable right to the free determination and the independence and from always has contributed to a large extent to that his fight have not dropped in the silence, by it that  *congratula that the term of office finish with a reaffirmation of positions and discern  his materialisation.
Equally, the Commission judges positive the establishment by part of the Nations Joined of a *transfund bear said query and, in this sense, *les have to inform that in this same week, probably tomorrow, approve  definitively the financial participation of the European Union in this *transfund , surely with the quantity of a million of euros that will go allocated precisely to study the modalities of the insertion of the European Union in the process.
I do not believe that any #another Parliament of the world loan *tanta attention to the cast of the fundamental rights and the human rights like this Parliament to the hour to debate the rape of the fundamental rights of the citizens with reason of the creation of a space of justice #european.
The proposal of the quota, together with the decision on the compensations for the crop of the industrial potatoes, do not influences, of any way, in the situation of competition of the industry *manufacturera. In fact it reduces  the production of starch of potato somehow, and in *eso do not have why put objections the producers of other starches.
I believe that our effort now, in the next weeks, will have to be convince to the #european citizens of the importance of his participation in the elections to this Parliament and believe that, at least the deputies that are here today, have taken all it possible so that our work was not a trivial work, but that it was an important and definite work for the #european construction.
Without embargo, have known through a source that, generally, is very informed, that already is circulating a species of preliminary draft of report by this Assembly, among the Committee of Wise persons, the services of the European Parliament and the services of the European Commission, a species of report preliminary.
A last comment on the intervention of the contrary side of the Assembly regarding the investiture of the new Commission: *nosotros *nos deny -and now talk in name of the socialist Group- to subordinate the procedure and the calendar of the Parliament to the presentation of a report of a group or a committee *extraparlamentarios.
But #if this pact pretends to be a pact allocated to intimidate of *algún mood to the Governments *socialdemócratas or to *crearles problems, the Mr. *Poettering and his political Group have to know that #this no only #would create difficulties to the Governments *socialdemócratas neither neither only to those Governments, as for example, the Austrian, in the that takes part also a conservative party, a Popular Party Christian, but that #would create difficulties to the process of unification #european.
It takes some moments remembered  with nice irony the electoral emblem with the that *me presented -the emblem of the donkey- and  *me invited to the *tozudez: an invitation that do not need because I am *tozudo by nature; without embargo, want to remember that the election of the donkey took  also reading a passage of #Leonardo da Vinci that, when describing to the donkey -do not know #if it is truth, because I do not have proofs- said that it is an odd animal, since it is able to die of thirst before that to drink dirty water.
It wanted to know #if, by initiative of the #finnish Presidency, will be able to deploy  at last, with the support of the #Red Cross and other international organisations, an action determined to force to the criminal of war *Milosevic to not taking it that *tantas times takes: use the blackmail, use to these persons that today are in his hands and of the that at all knows  to force once again to the European Union to release pieces.
*Nos Risk to remain trapped among two fires in these conflicts, unless the #european contingents do not assist powerless to the last stage of an ethnic purification that do not has *conmovido too much to the fine universal consciousness: the elimination of the last #serbian inhabitants of this region, that have happened to be minoritary in his country.
In the future years, the alimentary security of our *conciudadanos will depend fundamentally of the way in that the new Commission know to defend, in the course of the next negotiations of the round of the #Millenium, the full legitimacy of a model of zone #european distinct with an upper agricultural quality.
But also I affirm that *me seems absurd that the States members that in the past, by general norm, do not have  *atenido never to #european norms of security, want to forbid like general norm the animal flour; or that now the Commission take a general question of the utilisation of the rests of food in a document of work on purpose of the utilisation of oils and fats.
The second inform of the Committee of Experts Independent *nos helps in the guidelines, #many of the *cuales already appeared in the indications of the Parliament and *usted same has anticipated with clear commitments like the of the new criteria for the training of the cabinets and of a greater transparency in the relations with the European Parliament and with the public opinion.
Finally, the rage of the Mrs. Of Palace in the tyre of press back to the audition no *augura swims good for somebody among #whose competitions include  the relations with the European Parliament and, although I recognise that the Mrs. Of Palace  *disculpó later by his observations, awake without new embargo doubts about his capacity to exert this concrete charge in the breast of the new Commission.
We admit that the commissioners subjected to the trial of the Parliament, to judge by the audiences and by the statement today of the Mr. *Prodi, have, individual and collectively, of the capacity and the necessary resolution to serve faithful and *inquebrantablemente to the goals of the European Union, in detriment of the interests of the group of the workers and of the villages of *Europa.
We #can not ignore the challenges of the globalisation to the that at present it confronts  the Union, the peak of the audiovisual sector and of the society of the information, the need of an educational capacity of big *calado and amplitude and, finally, the need to establish the legitimacy of our institutions and give new vigour to his forms.
Of face to this preparatory meeting that will take place in *Turku tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and had account of the increasing presence in *Europa, by misfortune, of the delinquency organised, of the criminality related with the world of the drugs, of the traffic of human beings and of other similar offences, *me seemed incomprehensible that this House  *enzarzara in a discussion about #if it suits or not opening a debate on this question here in the European Parliament.
Likewise, the participation of the States members in the council of administration will allow to guarantee that a time that the Commission have decided the annual program, #all the other relative decisions to the projects take  on the terrain, without going back to resort to the committee of management formed by the States members in *Bruselas.
The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of a just access to the media, the absence of guarantees to be able to carry out an electoral campaign, have conducted to the opposition, majority, to boycott the legislative elections of the spring.
The total liberalisation *indiscriminada, #such as it has carried out in *Alemania, already is creating a difficult situation bear to the projects of *aprovechamiento of the biomass and also for the projects of energy solar. In the social field, is evident that early will give place to #a lot of cases, of lower dimensions, like the of "*Michelin" , because of the suppression "*racionalizadora" of employments to take go up the *cotización in bag of the energetic companies.
I have to say, gentleman President, that the *primer program *ALTENER and more advance the white Book on the renewable energies, that has developed the community strategy and the plan of action for the year 2010, have been possible graces, insist once again, to the collaboration among our two institutions, Parliament and Commission, and that the new politics of the European Union in matter of renewable energies has built  precisely thanks to the good understanding among *nosotros.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0015/99) of the Mrs. *Ahern, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves  a program *plurianual of promotion of the energetic efficiency (*SAVE) (1998-2002) (7123/1/99 - *C5-0033/99 - 97/0371(*COD)).
It is not precise to resort to the figures of exchanges commercial, investment and cooperation to the development to deduce the weight of the European Union in the region, but the tested economic solidarity of the European Union has to be so valued like his capacity to contribute effectively to a peaceful solution of the conflict.
Why we do not take to see to *Turquía that his recognition like country candidate to the adhesion constitutes the exception of what have demanded to the other countries (as for example, to *Eslovaquia) and that this exception takes  by special reasons (that we #would have to refer with clarity...), for *facilitarle the progress to the regulations demanded; and that his course the will be observing the European Parliament and that, at the end, #this will judge his real appeal to the adhesion to the European Union?
On the other hand, our society is legitimately concerned by the challenges that the phenomenon of the globalisation *nos poses: the respect of the human rights and of the fundamental social freedoms, the protection of the environment and the preservation of the nature, #as well as the protection of the health of our consumers.
With the solemn Statement of the month of June of 1998 the 174 countries members of the World-wide Organisation of the Work engaged  to promote the four fundamental rights of the work: the right of association, the respect of the labour minimum age, the prohibition of the works *forzosos and the no discrimination.
In the frame of the current agreement of the common position, the requirement of the amendment *nº 5, to know, create a directive of the EU with some goals *jurídicamente *vinculantes for the renewable energies, is the minimum previous condition so that the document #can be taken seriously at least of an approximate mood.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0028/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position approved by the Council (*COM(93) 646 - *C5-0030/1999 - 1994/0011(*COD)) with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the facilities of transport of persons by wire (Speaker: Mr. *Miller).
Having present that the own Defender the Village of the Government of *Colombia informs of a massacre by each day of this year and that the Commission of Jurists Colombian attributes the 78% of #the same to the *paramilitares, with the knowledge of the #colombian official strengths, #can *usted occupy, like President of this Parliament, that during his private conversations talk  of the subject of the human rights?
The first is to give the graces once again to the Mr. *Duisenberg for ensuring to this Assembly that the process of cooperation among the #ECB and the national central banks is now sufficient, even in the case of a grave crisis in the that a financial institution of the zone of the euro #can need support.
From this point of sight is a provocation for the feel democratic of the villages that the European Parliament consider an advance the fact that they give , with regularity, conferences of press after the meetings of the Council of Government of the #ECB or the fact that, apart from the annual report publish  monthly reports of the Central Bank European.
#This has to be the signal so that the great political strategies, budgetary and monetary do not pose  always according to the approach of the one who sees the novelty of an only coin, but of the one who has to take into account the long term to give stability to the euro and to the States members, and especially to reactivate the economy of the Union and the chapter of the employment that so much *nos concerns to #all in this Parliament.
Like this, it is necessary that there #be another form of intervention of the #ECB and an effective democratic control of his operation and that in the #european politics concede  priority to the resolution of the economic and social problems of the European Union and of his States members, in particular the politics of growth and creation of employment.
In the first place, it is necessary to encourage and boost to the #european citizens, the associations and the small #european companies of the sector, to benefit  of this program it more possible averting concentrate the already scarce finances only in #few great events, in benefit of some those that privileged networks that, in the long run, as *nos teaches the previous experience, finish for having the monopoly of said finances; second, it #would be timely to take all it possible to increase the planned financial endowment for this program.
I consider that the Parliament, in the moment in that it approves a measure of this type, offers a big opening to the #turkish youngsters that complaining of the errors of his parents, #can watch to *Europa like a reality of big freedom, like a union of States in the *cuales the culture, his diffusion and the solidarity among the youngsters are important and fundamental elements.
By this reason and to end to guarantee a high grade of security in the so much national transport like international and eradicate the distortions of the competition, the European Union adopted the Directive 96/49 on the approximation of the legislations of the States relative members to the transport of commodities dangerous by railway.
And that constitutes a reason of pride particular, since this prize carries the name of a scientist, *Andrei *Sajarov, that subjected his prestige to hard proofs of #all type to struggle by the freedom of the villages of the countries of the East against #one of the most #hideous forms of totalitarianism that has known this century.
But I #can comprise part of the anger that feel the graziers and the consumers of Big *Bretaña *cuando  *enteran that they have found  silts *cloacales in the *piensos that employ  in *Francia, *cuando  *enteran that the #british Government knew #this from the month of June but decided not touching the subject in the European Commission, and *cuando  *enteran that in the Realm Joined still sacrifice 60.000 heads of livestock because have more of 30 months of age and #can not go in in the alimentary chain, although they are animal perfectly healthy.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, #would suit *usted *conmigo in that it results very surprising that #some States members ask now new explanations and additional explanations *cuando #this already debated  during a year and half with these same States members in the Permanent Veterinary Committee? And it #would suit *usted *conmigo in that the States members that keep the prohibition of the imports #would have to present new scientific data or of it contrary only give the impression of that they want to follow postponing until a distant future the realisation of the only market?
Lady Speaker, want to signal that the dialogue *macroeconómico forms part of the complex process of the pact of the employment and that, as it has exposed well the Presidency in exercise of the Council, is consequence of the decisions of Colony, trying, by means of the establishment of this dialogue among social and responsible speakers of the economic politics and budgetary politics with participation also of the Central Bank European, achieve the goals that, at the end, pretend.
We #can begin to abandon concepts like #that? We #can begin maybe to adopt a more realistic opinion in the fixation of the types of interest, with it that #would recognise  the change of the conditions, by it that now #can begin to contain the increases of the types of interest, to measure that diminishes the unemployment, not to suffocate a fragile growth?
Definitely, in his common position the Council has adopted #some important points as, for example, the compulsory implantation of values limit in two stages, a greater requirement on the durability of the squads of control of broadcasts in the commercial vehicles weighed and buses, a system of #diagnosis *on.*board, a control of field.
Although my Group #would have put *gustosamente other accents *algo different in #some points of the program *DAPHNE, for example the connection with other community programs as *PHARE, *TACIS and *MEDA, because in #this there #be big quantity of resources to set up in the countries preventive measured candidates and campaigns, agree with the Mrs. *Avilés regarding reaching a fast consensus and avert a procedure of conciliation, and recommend only six amendments to the common position.
The Commission will ensure specifically that this program was a notable road to pipe the synergies of the public authorities and of the *ONG to conserve the physical and psychic integrity and the social welfare of the boys, the teenagers and the women in #all the fields of activity.
*Ellas Express better of it that #would take it *yo the way in that the boys are excluded of the politics of the European Union and in that the laws and the politics that takes the European Union have a very real impact in the lives of the boys, an impact that is not #the same that have in the lives of the adults.
At present, this subject is in the centre of a political debate very lit in my country and *me seems totally inopportune, by not saying, inadmissible that our Speaker, given his institutional position, support so ardently to #one of the parts involved and besides ignore that an article of the #italian Constitution refers  on purpose to the freedom to open centres of education deprived without costs for the State.
#If I use a very critical tone, do not take it fundamentally against *usted, lady *Schreyer, as *usted has not been the responsible person during the last weeks, but #if like Parliament at the end of a year, in autumn, elaborate a budget, then split of the fact that in this budget determine some priorities and that these priorities are also the that in the course of procedure budgetary apply  really, *surten effects and expect that it that consider important apply  also really in form of politics.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate on the report (To5-0039/1999) of the Mr. *Chichester, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1998) 571 - *C4-0040/1999) and to the European Parliament "Promotion of the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the energetic politics of the Community" .
Gentleman President, this proposal that will resolve -like this expect it- by means of a community regulation the difficulties that find the citizens and the families to consequence of the fault of recognition of the judicial decisions on the end of the matrimonial bond and the exercise of the homeland authority deserves our applause and our charm.
Regarding the amendment *nº 11 -and expect to that formulate  a new oral proposal to be able to *pronunciarme on the new version-, *cuando forces to take into account the interests of the boys, *nos seems that it opens the door for a trial -regarding the bottom by part of the State that has to receive the judicial decision- that do not has fit in the frame of this type of instrument.
The Commission is commissioned also of the execution of the program *STOP, #whose goal is the to give the necessary training and information to the professionals, in particular to the judges, to the services of police and to the services of assistance social, in the fight against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of women.
Regarding the group of high level, #if the Commission and the Council approve it -as I already have said, the Commission will take it predictably the next day 24 of this month, the Council on 6 December-, the pretence #would be that this group of high level began to work to first of the month of February or even to finals of the month of January.
An international rule in matter of competition has to establish some minimum norms that prevent contrary behaviours to the competition, like the creation of cartels for the control of the prices or the cast of zones, the abuse of position dominant or vertical restrictions and horizontals of the competition, #all the *cuales distort the competition.
The attacks against columns of refugees and zones inhabited, the closing of the borders and the fetters to the performance of the international organisations of help that loan humanitarian help, no only contravene in #all the cases the Convention of Gin on protection of the civil population in the zones in war and other international commitments, but that they are performances simply inhuman and of the all unacceptable.
The norms that regulate the international economic relations and the trade have to respect the fundamental social rights, have to serve to the interests of the workers, contribute to the development of the less developed countries, respect the environment and create the necessary conditions for the development of #all the villages.
We have considered, in base to the Statement of Colony, that the works *preparativos have to concentrate, in the practice, in three particular points: the size and the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the votes in the Council and the extension of the qualified majority; in addition to these three points, also will treat  institutional questions related closely with #the same.
The amendment 18 of my Group, that requests that the Parliament was consulted on the annual economic orientations, the decisions that concern to the budgetary deficits and #all another important decision that have to take  in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union, leaving, of course, to a side the independence of the Central Bank European.
To #the same time, also wanted to *replicarle to the Mrs. *Kaufmann, that finishes to quote to the newspaper of the enemy of class, "*Die *Welt" , that the party to the that *ella belonged has been the only #german party that has summoned to a war of aggression after the *Segunda World-wide War, specifically against *Checoslovaquia, and to the sight of *ello, #would have to abstain to take comments like the that finishes to pronounce.
Subject: political Prisoners in *Myanmar #Can the Speaker in exercise of the Council inform on #all the celebrated debates and the decisions adopted recently by the Council of Ministers of External Subjects in relation with the politics followed by the EU regarding *Myanmar and, in particular, on the possibility to achieve of the Government of this country an amnesty for the political prisoners?
#If we do not approve today the report *nos will find in an unsustainable situation, as only the deputies of the European Parliament #would be above the law to #that *respecto: a text that applies  in the Council by the same to the politicians and civil servants, in the Commission by the same to the politicians and civil servants, #would apply  in the Parliament only to our civil servants and no to the deputies of the European Parliament.
The best demonstration, anyway, of #which is the security that promotes  is the own Treaty of *Amsterdam, the incorporation of it already achieved in *Schengen, the creation of some community police, the police #index card of the citizens by his political convictions, his ideological orientation, his #sindical action, even by his loving relations.
*Me Seems that the Mrs. *Giannakou has taken a big effort for adopting a posture of consensus concerning the Plan of action, directed to integrate the different perspectives that there #be no only among the different *filiaciones political, but also among the different national traditions, to integrate also the different looks of the question and the diverse and in contradictory part interests.
Therefore, *me #would enjoy that my explanations went satisfactory, that the Parliament #can reconsider his requests, that gave  the maximum urgency to the acceptance of this decision with the guarantee that, #if in the future there were problems from the point of sight financial, the Commission will pose the need to go more far regarding the Bottom of reservation.
For no *alargarme more, want to manifest that our Group supports the 19 amendments and supports the legislative text, but demands that we do not attend to #one *segunda reading, but that approve  this Regulation in the planned terms, demands that the Commission was sensitive to it exposed by the speaker, to it exposed by the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market and that, by favour, the Regulation approve  inside the planned terms because, in contrary case, the situation for Canarians #would be worrisome.
To the time that receive with satisfaction the contribution of the Parliament, also want to recognise the contribution of the European Commission along the years, and in particular the of the ancient Presidents, the President *Delors, our colleague and ancient President #Jacques *Santer and now the President *Prodi, the one who in his statement of yesterday engaged  to keep the bottoms allocated to the distinct programs of *Irlanda of the North.
Among #all the human rights, the freedom of expression occupies a special place, since without a free and independent information #can not fulfil the other human rights and fundamental rights, neither neither #can  report effectively the grave rapes of the human rights, as, for example, the crimes against the humanity.
Why they have not included  other relative problems to the human rights that know that they exist in the Union, #such as the bad deals in the prisons and in the stations of police, the murders committed by political Groups armed and the situation of the objectors of consciousness, by so only appoint the most evident subjects?
Only it wanted to *describirles a small consequence of this approximation. To my mood to see, is a big progress that #greek journalists and Turkish are collaborating in the actuality to avert that in the media stood out of his countries continue the defamation to the that have assisted in the last years and give  erroneous information to the population on it that *sucede in the neighbouring country.
Concerning the proposals presented in the report, also consider that it is necessary a reform, since the current situation has perverse effects -as it already has shown the experience-, but is precise to take into account that any reform #can leave to consider the results of the current campaign and the potentialities of the #portuguese production in normal climatic conditions.
In this sense, the recommendations on the politics of communication and information that contains the Report Towers Mark play an essential paper, but do not owe *conformarnos with that the euro perfect the only market neither with that the euro allow, for example, a comparison of prices easier or a decrease of the cost of the transactions.
#This reflects #one of the lacks of the proposal of the Commission, that #would have to have completed the frame of the *OCM with a mechanism of maintenance of the income of the workers of the fishing that allowed to limit the incidence of the falls of prices and, with *ello, take unnecessary the resource to the withdrawal and destruction of the products of the fishing.
#One of the means to obtain said support #would be the to keep our offer for the less advanced countries and *reflexionar together on the coherence among the action of the *OMC and the of the other international institutions so that the commercial liberalisation reflect  in a sustainable development for #all the countries in roads of development, beginning by the poorest populations.
*Me #Would enjoy that the countries that bear the charge of the effort of the economic internal cohesion and social did not employ this type of arguments, since they are the countries that receive bottoms of the European Union the most interested in the efficiency of this effort of solidarity of the countries that bear this effort.
Without embargo, said frustration converts  in even more deep, #if it fits, *cuando, to the sight of the new scientific elements, as in the case of the substances that determine the destruction of the ozone, the bureaucracy and the emotiveness taking the forward to the politics and the science, prevent that they admit  new and effective amendments from the point of sight scientific.
#If the conditions observed still do not allow to initiate the negotiations with *Turquía, but so only *concederle the statute of candidate to the adhesion, with which do not creates  therefore a particular juridical instrument, the conclusion -#can *leerla in the text- is that it is precise to resort to the UN for the definition of the disputes. Of compliance with the resolutions of the UN, #this #would have to resolve  before the year 2004.
#If at all it justifies the past and present politics of *Milosevic regarding the #albanian village of *Kosovo, neither regarding his own village, the crumbs launched only for the reconstruction of *Kosovo, crumbs in comparison with the money spent in the war, #can not dissemble the fact that once again the western intervention in the *Balcanes no only do not resolves the problems in this region of the world but that the aggravates.
Of compliance with the section 3 of the article 247 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community and the corresponding disposals of the Treaties *CECA and *EURATOM, the Parliament has issued his *dictamen previous on the candidates before the Council proceed to the nomination by unanimity of the members of the Court of Accounts by a period of six years, that #can repeat mandate.
Of then it is also the agreement for the creation of indicators, and have assisted in April of 1999 to the publication of the first resulted of these common indicators, that take in consideration the place of the woman, in the economic field, in the political field and in the social field, in relation with the programs of development that approve .
From this Assembly urge to the Commission to give preference to a review of #all the structures of consultancy and of decision, to end to obtain a just distribution among the sexes, and to request to the States members that fulfil with the recommendation of the Council of 2 December 1966, on equality among men and women in the processes of decision.
From the platform of *Beijing, and of the commitment of the 189 countries around this platform, there #be, by it that *atañe to the European Union, to our region, three fields of action: first, the of each #one of the states members; second, the of the political strategy of the group of the European Union; and, third, the of the politics of the European Union to the countries in development.
The question is not, as, #if they go  to concede #some thousands of litres of oil to the orphanages and the asylums, but #if  *le go to deliver the necessary games to *Yugoslavia, to his legally chosen government -respect of a time the international right!- And no *selectivamente, to confront the damages and put end to the political genocide suffered by the #serbian village.
The amendments that has proposed the Parliament treat to cover this grave gap and have an ambitious goal, #this is, create a legislative system that, in spite of devoting special attention to avert create useless bureaucratic complications, allow to the great productive potentialities of the Union express it better possible in the inner market facilitating, therefore, his action also in the world-wide.
In these days in the that so much it talks  of the paper and of the future of the community Institutions, wanted to remember that the credibility of an organ like the Parliament or the Council is closely linked to his capacity to resolve the problems that disturb the daily life of the citizen or to take part positively to the *respecto.
I have to confess that, *cuando returned again to *Timor Oriental, remained *desolado in front of the ruins of the systematic destruction and no *me imagined that it #would come to *Estrasburgo and #would have the rare opportunity to know and visit the corridors and the living rooms of the centre of the democratic power of *Europa, #one *Europa that shared with *nosotros the pain and the suffering of the genocide, but also the prowess and the strength to resist the destroyer action and murderer.
Likewise, it encourages  for finding a solution to the regional riots, already mentioned here, in *Aceh and *Iria *Jaya and to the ethnic tensions in the *Molucas by the road of the peaceful dialogue and of the constitutional reforms; I consider particularly important that exist a National Commission for the Human Rights that treat the relative questions to #such rights.
Gentleman President, like member of the Group of the Green/Free Alliance European and like #basque deputy, have to say in the first place that already the European Union, by diplomatic road, directed  to the Government of *Nicaragua the past 18 November so that it found  a fast solution to this subject that *nos occupies today and finished  with the obstacles that  *oponían to the *Contraloría General of the Republic of *Nicaragua and for *decirles also, very categorically that, #if it is not  transparent, #can lose the bottoms of the European Union.
Already it has remembered  in this Plenary his implication in the subjects related with the paper of the citizens in the procedure established in the article 169, the editorial of a code of behaviour of the civil servants, the access to the documents of the Institutions and of the organs controlled by *usted.
The fact that the Parliament renounced to his proposal to build some common customs in the procedure of conciliation celebrated in the frame of the previous report do not means that #this have left to be our final goal.
The report of the Mrs. *Schmidbauer is #worthy of praise because it treats of the development of a gradual approach concerning a frame of infrastructure for the rates of the common transports inside the European Union, #as well as of a gradual harmonisation of the relative principles to the rates of #all the main means of transport.
The reason is that, as we have been able to check in the audience of scientists and experts celebrated in the Commission of Transports and tourism the day 17 February 1999, the system of the social costs *marginales proposed by the socialist commissioner of transports #Neil *Kinnock do not serves to impute the costs of the infrastructure of transport.
The article 135 establishes that the attributions of the commissions appear *anejas to the Regulation, but do not excludes at all the absolute majority, and, treating of a text that defines at all less that the competitions of the parliamentary commissions, #would be paradoxical that, as it finishes to occur, the composition of a competent commission in an essential field -as it is the of the immunities- fix , simply, with #some votes of difference.
»Collateral damages», #this is the language used by the NATO to define the death of civilians: during centuries in the *Balcanes will have to bear  the called *collateral *damages , since the bombs of uranium employed by the NATO already have contaminated the #yugoslav territory preventing, in fact, the return of the #Kosovar to his country, unless they run the risk of illnesses, malformations and deaths by radiation.
*Señorías, wanted to underline, nevertheless, the need that the Commission elaborate a program of helps in favour of the #italian and #french populations that will suffer considerable damages and damages owing to the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, so much by the excessive traffic of other arteries receptors of an excess of traffic, as by the shortage of traffic and of tourism owed to the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc.
The Council in his statement of the past 7 April, when pronouncing  on #this, added that the #indonesian Government has given #some steps that have been clearly celebrated. *Eso Also has to see, among other things, with the elections, with new laws for the political parties, but also with determined economic measures that have announced  to stabilise the economic situation.
The impressive number of operations of traffic that effect  every year in the European Union and the importance of the sums that are in game #would suffice by himself/hisself alone to show the urgency in concluding the computerisation of the diet of traffic community and to guarantee to #the same time a maximum transparency in the group of the politics *aduanera #european.
It will give  a big step the day in that the space situated among the Parliament and the season was at last conditioned, of #such way that facilitate the personal relations and result friendly: for *ello is necessary to unblock the necessary means, it that will require #one *concertación active among the society of the Space *Léopold, the Parliament (by his moral paper) and the #belgian authorities affected.
It is necessary that the European Union tackle these negotiations with the real will to defend the principle of prevention, #as well as the social norms, environmental and on the welfare of the animals, necessary for a healthy and durable trade that respect the group of our economies and of our consumers.
It is necessary to expand and improve the measures in matter of prevention, information and protection of the victims, #as well as the cooperation and the coordination with the justice, the police, the responsible authorities and, especially, with the competent governmental organisations, in the States members of the European Union, among the States members of the European Union and also in collaboration with the third countries involved.
Both amendments supported  in the valid Regulation, and now have agreed that are in contradiction with *él. According to the current Regulation, for a transfer of credits of the reservation is competent the Commission of Budgets and for the rest of the transfers - am talking in general terms - the Commission of Control Budgetary.
The exchange of experiences that produced  in the preparation of the conference among the Group of the Popular Party, the Union of the Persons of Age and #a lot of experts has served to obtain #all a series of knowledges valuable on the matter.
In this context wanted to ask to the Commission #if the regulation of application collects this look, since I consider very important that the current system of balance among the starch of potato and the starch of corn respect . To keep said balance is fundamental that keep  the system of premiums compensatory to the starch of potato.
It wanted to express my gratitude very especially to his speaker the Mrs. *Theato, that alas #can not be among *nosotros, and also of course to the speaker of the particular opinion of this commission, the Mrs. *Kjer *Hansen, #as well as to #all the members of this commission, that have taken an excellent work, since these contributions have had direct relation with the development of this procedure.
It supposes also an important innovation when allowing separate on the one hand, the closing of the accounts -a species of procedure technical simple, as, to verify #if they have carried  well the accounts- and by #another, the discussion or the opinion of the Parliament on the management of the Commission in budgetary matter.
In the norms appears now a very important distinction among a technical postponement and a political postponement, that has to have some clear foundations, to the equal that appears also a clear separation among the technical closing of the accounts and the political posture that #can adopt on the question of #if we approve or no the accounts.
In concrete, the report of the Commission of Employment sues it following: increase of the proportion of unemployed that receive an active measure of promotion, like professional training, or measures of creation of work, in front of the proposals that exist in the guidelines, the autonomy of the Central Bank European and the autonomy of the social speakers, #as well as greater efforts directed to consolidate the public finances.
The existence, in this moment, of the Economic and Monetary Union shows that it do not treats  of a formality, but of a dynamic treatment of economic and monetary subjects, that presupposes besides the coordination no only of the monetary politics, but also of the economic and social politics of the states of the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted colleagues, is a bit surprising to see as on the one hand our European Union poses a debate on the great orientations of the economic politics extremely prolix, with concrete obligations and with a pact of stability rigorous, and on the other hand a politics of employment to base only of wander orientations, while *nos happen #all the time saying that the big problem of *Europa and of the Europeans is the employment.
*Me Interests especially take this brief intervention first of all for *recalcar the important paper exerted by the Mr. *Bösch, the *cual -even in the moments in that it was very difficult to carry forward this speech- always has been very coherent to the hour to sustain the need of an independent organ, to the sight of the gravity of the cases and of the difficulties for *afrontarlos.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, the report of the that  *me has commissioned *informarles tonight in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic refers  to the proposal of the Commission to modify the *sexta managerial relative to the VAT of #such mood that the States members have the possibility to apply, with experimental character, the type reduced of the VAT on the services of big intensity of hand of drama.
Our Group *le sues to develop fully his paper in the election of the commissioners to obtain a substantial renewal of the school and a presence of men, and also of women, able to face up, by his qualification, to the great political challenges of the Union and to the own reform of the Commission.
And although, in effect, *usted has gone back to announce that the Commission goes to develop the liberalisation of the market of sakes material and services, instead have not heard at all on the public services, on the services of interest economic general, as they appear now with total clarity in the article 7*D of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
The five points that pose the European Union, the NATO and the General Secretary of the UN are not five points that *equivalgan to a total war against Serbian, but five points that take possible the security and the stability for #all in *Kosovo and that at the same time guarantee and allow the development of the security and the stability in the region.
In the first place, to the classical international Right, according to the *cual a war only #can initiate after having been declared, it that has not been the case; how the Government of the States Joined of *América abstain  in the future of *enseñarnos the images of archive of the speeches of *Roosevelt after the bombardment of *Pearl *Harbour by part of the #japanese squadron.
The reason *nos #would have pushed, for example, *cuando began the crisis -perhaps is very easy to say it now to the sight of the events- to value the relation among the political goals and the political effects of the bombardments and the noble goal that *nos proposed, the to put end to the ethnic cleansing.
As they will remember, the very good report of the Mrs. *Schmidbauer on the White Book of the Commission in relation with the payment by the utilisation of infrastructures also specified this look and, at present, are tackling the task to quantify the external looks with the help, clear is, of a group of experts.
To contribute to the reflection, the Commission will present to the European Council a communication on the best way to integrate the goal of a level of employment high in the definition and the application of the politics and of the actions of the Community.
#If we had not suffered the crisis that has shaken to the Commission, *nos #would have found in a situation in the that, in spite of the demands of this Parliament, the European Council had decided without taking into account the opinion of the constituents that will go to the urns of the 10 to 13 June.
In a similar situation, the buyer has to return the product in the place of the purchase so that  *le return his money, repair  the product, etc. #Would have been much better -and #would have contributed authentic advantages to the consumers- #if #this had right to negotiate said compensation or repair, etc, with a representative of the company -in case that it exist- in his country of residence.
The vote, in session *plenaria, ratified entirely the positions defended by this Commission of Fishing and, from this moment, our commission, and fundamentally his speaker *doña #Carmen *Fraga, went in in contact with the Council, the national administrations and the professional organisations, organising a public audience that allowed to check how the political position of the Parliament was amply shared.
Like speaker of this file, have to remember that the Commission, in his initial proposal, had prioritised especially the orientation of a reform based in a substantial descent of the prices with the goal to increase our parts of the market to the export in the frame of the obligations imposed by the *OMC.
Regarding the political advances, #would have to underline, as more important and new, the following: it consolidates  a series of agreements punctual pre-existing; it offers  a definite solution to the dispute on the classification of costs compulsory and no compulsory, that drags  from 1982; they happen  costs of the Common Agricultural Politics to costs no compulsory.
His goal is to allow to the persons progress to the new #millenium; take possible that are the own persons the that make said progress through the training and the education, increasing his possibilities to achieve a place of work, of *ayudarles to progress with the time to access to a place of work better and to a better level of life.
I appreciate to the President in exercise his answer, but *permítame ask #if it has foreseen  a suitable protection for the entrance of bananas pertinent of *Lomé and of the Canarian Islands, in spite of the changes that have produced  to adapt the diet of the banana of the European Union to the norms of the *OMC.
Neither it has presented  to the Presidency of the Council any complaint of *Suecia in the sense that it neglect  his language in the guilds of the Council, by it that it wanted to *aconsejarle that perhaps #would not have to bet necessarily by an anonymous news of an agency of #news but by the official communication that receives here of the Presidency of the Council.
It is an end to measure, since with the favourable vote to the proposals of the Diary the Parliament, in the last session of this term of office and to #the same last time session under #german Presidency, seats the bases of the future development of the European Union and no only of the future Agricultural Politics Common.
My group has expressed  from the principle in favour of a reform of the structural and regional promotion that concentrate the available financial resources in the regions with the greater demand of development and that at the same time award a greater level of responsibility to the States members, especially there #where complete regions remain excluded of the structural helps of the EU.
The relations among the Commission of Fishing and the committees quoted have two main looks. By a part the Commission of Fishing receives information on the activities of the committees and, by #another, the members of the commission have the possibility to take part like observers in the meetings of the committees referred.
The juridical looks today examined constitute the indispensable base to regulate and harmonise the electronic agreements, the use and the future developments, always that Internet was accessible to #all, accessible but no regulated, to defend to the most exposed classes, especially the boys; protect against the electronic illegality, the *intrusismo by wire, but boost all *aquello that it #can generate places of work and expand our culture.
The bottoms of the EU contributed likewise to transform *Manchester in a big cultural core and tourist, when helping to build the centre of exhibitions *G *Mex, the hall of concerts of *Bridgewater, the Museum of the Science and the Industry of *Manchester and the Imperial Museum of the War (North).
It is inadmissible that the report, #such as it presents it the Commission of Budgets, contain an amendment that goes much more there of the object of the own report, until the point that #this results totally ambiguous, since *cuando had examined it in the Commission of Budgets, on 29 April, did not treat , in this moment, to approve the text of the agreement.
Like member of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development and coordinator of the Group *Europa of the Nations, have voted against of the group of the amendments presented in the Commission of Agriculture by our speaker, the Mr. *Graefe *zu *Baringdorf, since his proposals were totally incoherent regarding the economic situation that knows the #european agriculture.
Therefore, we #can not leave to value -to the contrary that #some colleagues- the yesterday assumed commitment that the query of 8 August will make  with the *égida of the Nations Joined and of his Council of Security and that, in addition to the strength of police that here it has talked , was possible to have the presence of a strength of security.
Of course, gentleman President, *Turquía has not suffered any type of pressure special -and, of course, am not talking of the abominable bombardments that know other countries- for *avenirse to the norms of a State of right current. By reasons that the Council of Ministers, so sensitive or severe in other cases, has not achieved *explicarnos!
A time established these responsibilities, the European Union has the duty of *paliar the inability of the usual protagonists of the stage *comorano, launching an initiative of reconciliation *inter-islands, a significant humanitarian help, in particular directed to *Anjouan, and an original plan of urgent economic help for the State *comorano.
In the case of the #czech head office of *Temelin, the attainment of the levels of maximum security demanded to the candidates to the adhesion in matter of nuclear head offices did not seems at all reliable, especially to the sight of the planned employment by the authorities of the Czech Republic of these reactors of type #soviet -the *VVER 100- presented like squads of last generation, although they give proofs of scarce reliability.
The Commission understands that the reactors of *Temelin are of a type that, in principle, #can improve  to reach levels of acceptable security and, as it indicates  in the Diary 2000 and in the communication of March of 1998, the general goal of the Commission, by it that refers  to this type of reactors, is to guarantee that the improvements undertaken by the corresponding countries apply  of fast and effective way and carry to satisfactory results.
It says: there #be an agreement of 1995 that has not been signed by #all the States members and the Commission is thinking to adopt an initiative #Can have a promise of the Commissioner regarding that the Commission goes to adopt a proposal, was a directive, was a regulation -leave it  to the Commission-, so that it no longer take lacking expect to the States members *titubeantes?
The goal precisely is not a militarisation of the European Union, but follow promoting his development so that it was an effective peaceful power and with capacity of performance that was in conditions of *relegar definitively to the happened the war like instrument of the politics in *Europa, in favour of the empire of the Right and of the renunciation to the use of the strength, #such as it has taken in *Kosovo.
The first refers  to the point 53 of the conclusions of the Presidency in exercise of the Council and *me #would enjoy to ask to #that with regard to the gentleman #german Minister of External Subjects how interpretation it is necessary to give to the mandate of the Conference *Intergubernamental and, in particular to -quote- the possible enlargement of the vote by qualified majority in the Council -end of the appointment-, had account of the statement of *Bélgica, *Francia and #Italia attach to the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
The *primer reason: in the era of the globalisation, the national State European only will be able to keep it that appreciate and want to conserve in *él #if #this *Europa unifies  as, under the conditions of globalisation, the peace, the security, the welfare and the democracy for his citizens and citizens, only will be able to  guarantee #if they join  to #european level, is to say, #if we have of a subject European, a European Union that it was able to act.
Of compliance with the agenda, the Speaker in exercise of the Council proceeds to take a statement on the program of activity of the #finnish Presidency, the economic and social reconstruction in *Kosovo and the project of Pact of Stability for the *sudeste of *Europa and the conviction of the Mr. *Öcalan to the capital pity.
The concept of dimension #nordic of the EU, that is shyly going out to the light although among *candilejas, covers sectors related with the internal security, as they #can be the nuclear security, the environmental and the collaboration with external neighbouring zones to the Union.It is necessary to materialise in programs of concrete activity the ideas presented around the #nordic dimension of the Union .
Regarding *Öcalan, it minimum that we #can take by this person to the that #many describe of terrorist of #the same way, clear, that described of terrorist to *Arafat, or to the IRE, before being recognised leaders and leaders of his villages, it minimum that we #can take, after the sinking in this subject of the politics of asylum of the European Union and the one who has said it has #a lot of reason, is *salvarle the life, to avert like this a new *lacra in our leaf of services.
The Council studied immediately this case and took the resolution on 9 July to carry the subject to the courts of the European Community, basing in the paragraph 2 of the section 3 of the article 213 of the Letter *Magna and in pertinent articles of *Euratom and of the Community of the Coal and the Steel.
The Commissioners will have to, in case that like this  *les demand, leave that the Committee of Subjects Ethical examine the type of work to the that will incorporate  during the term of a year after having left the Commission, with the end that #this #can confirm the compatibility of the new work with the functions fulfilled in his quality of Commissioner.
Lady Speaker, want *referirme to the comment that took yesterday the Mrs. Speaker, the Mrs. *Fontaine, on the prohibition of the use of telephones mobile inside this hemicycle because I believe that at all there #be more important, inside the Parliament, that talk and *comunicarnos, but in the debates, no with external means like the mobile telephones, with the bells and the distortion that #this causes.
The reasons that *nos have carried to this situation, against the that the president of my Group carries warning from the month of June, have to see with that it has not known  put the limit of the institutional responsibility to those groups that thought that the content of the report #can condition the investiture of the new Commission and, therefore, have insisted in that it debated  now.
The Group of the Party of the European Socialists has kept a line of behaviour coherent along #all the process, that  *resume in the affirmation of the need to surpass positively the institutional and political crisis that paralyses to the Union from December of the past year.
Lamentably, gentleman President, although the Mrs. Of Palace answered to our questions on transport of satisfactory way, and that like Group will not doubt in backing morning to the Commission, have to take state our reservation on the candidature of the Mrs. Of Palace #waiting for the definite results of the *OLAF and of the investigations of the #spanish authorities, and because of the mood in that it answered to the interrogation on this subject during the audition.
Answering to the comment of Baron *Crespo, that yesterday in the morning signalled that a minister *recalcitrante of *Baviera had not resigned, *permítanme that *le put to the common of the situation: the alluded resigned yesterday before the vote in the Parliament; without embargo, a lot *me fear that surely it will have to pass another century before the European Commission reach the level of efficiency of the #bavarian administration.
The *segunda splits refers  to the interpretation that has to include like note to the Regulation, without embargo, the first part says: "The statement of constitution of the technical group is not according to the section 1 of the article 29 of the Regulation" . *Usted *nos Commissioned this subject and *nos awarded the possibility to formulate our interpretation like note to the Regulation *valedera also for the future.
The deputy, Mrs. *Roth-*Behrend has called the attention on a *importantísimo subject. The Commission, when fixing the own priorities and propose the approval of #this has to have in mind the subjects that really matter to the citizens like the questions of environment, a sustainable development completely #as well as the requirements of protection of the consumers.
Fifteen executives that displace  to *Bruselas, exert there his legislative work, go back act followed to his respective capitals and apply the laws dictated by the Council, or was, by *ellos same. This method of work takes that the executives exclude increasingly to the national Parliaments -*Europol and the preparation of the convention *Europol are a clear example of *ello- without *traspasar the legislative function to the European Parliament.
But the truth is that, later, so much the Nations Joined like the international observers and the own #indonesian authorities, that considered that the scrutiny passed of free and just form in spite of #all the pressures and of the campaign of intimidation carried out by the militias adherents of the integration, the truth -said- is that, *cuando took  public the results, again installed  the terror in *Timor Oriental.
It is very clear that the authorities have to take in account the possibility of movements seismic when examining the suitability of place chosen for the construction, and have the obligation to ensure , through the pertinent structural solutions, that a possible seism neither affect to the security of the head office.
In this sense consider important to take a more global assessment, to the light of the politics in matter of interventions that, as I have read in the report on the budget of the Union of the next year, foresees a strong restructuring of the politics of attention to the present small and medium enterprises inside the territory *transfronterizo.
From beginnings of year have produced  #news *alentadoras on the recovery of the industrial production, mainly like result of the replacement of the imports, the control relatively tighten of the inflation and a solider situation of the scales of payments, produced mainly by the strong rise of the price of the exports of oil.
From it takes *algún time, the Commission has recognised that exists a connection among the flight of capital and the corruption and the criminality in *Rusia, and comprise also the threat *acumulativa that represent these conditions for the transition of the country to a democratic system and an economy of market that govern  by the state of right.
Meanwhile, the Commission considers that, in particular in #day of said elections, has to continue the politics of opening *cautelar of the relations with will go through a wide dialogue, with seen to encourage to the Government of the Mr. *Khatami and to the defenders of the reform, #many of the *cuales are showing a considerable prowess in his efforts by the change in some extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances.
They will continue our efforts to achieve the support and the durable stability, and of course, also will follow trying keep to this fully informed Parliament, because we value enormously the commitment with our common goals to guarantee the stability and the maintenance of the peace in this so ailed region of problems.
Nevertheless, *me ask #if *Europa really #can carry out an autonomous politics in this field. Until how point will defend the Commission our autonomy in the international scene and in how measured will struggle for saving the power of decision #european in matter of alimentary security and the political decisions in the field of the alimentary products?
Nevertheless, more that of a new action treats  to see #if the considering *nº 25 did not reflects already this need to give priority to the exports to improve the position of the #european industry, world-wide leader in some renewable energies, and to it that have taken reference #some of the orators, because it is truth that here have some very clear advantages with regard to other producers.
In conclusion, and to the light of said considerations, wanted to call the attention on the need to make, in matters so complex in that the market and his rules confront  to the collective welfare, analysis of cost-benefit #whose temporary reference was the long term for the introduction of measures directed to reduce the energetic intensity of the final demand.
An agreement that establishes the total liberalisation of the 95% of the #south african exports to the EU along a period of ten years with the elimination of the corresponding tariffs to the 86% of his industrial products covers a too much long time for a country that confronts economic and social problems so grave.
With #such reason, want to ask #if the Commission will present the agenda of the meetings of the Commission and the documents of work more important before the meeting of the Commission so that like this it #can appear #any information on the documents in the press before the celebration of the meeting and exist greater interest by the meetings by part of the press.
The inclusion of *Turquía -by the moment #can not say at all concretise in name of my political group since we are keeping still a debate to the *respecto, although personally I believe that it has to have the status of candidate to the adhesion to the European Union, #such as it has said the Mr. *Verheugen- is urgently necessary no only for the democratisation of *Turquía but also for the peace and stability in the *Balcanes and in the *sudeste of *Europa.
The peace among the two States, #Israel and Palestinian, will not be durable but with the condition that his economies develop  in the frame of a favourable regional cooperation to a sustainable and just development for #all the parts, a cooperation that in *primer term has to take into account the most vulnerable territories: we think, for example, in the problem of the water.
Subject: common Politics In past July, the #finnish minister of External Subjects took the word in *Estrasburgo, in his quality of representative of the Presidency of the Council, to affirm that the goals of *Finlandia are that the Union have of a common will, a common politics and a common voice.
Nevertheless, it exists a wide majority in the Parliament in favour of the #european participation, no only with the exchange of the best practical or the procedures of cooperation, with it that agree, but also with the utilisation of #some of the previous programs that existed in the past; in particular, the programs of Poverty *I and Poverty *II and the mood in that #this tackled the problems using an approach that split from the base.
*Permítame *preguntarle, gentleman President in exercise, #if it #would be had to present an initiative in the breast of the Council to ask to the Commission that believes a new relative program to the poverty that take use of it better of the past, but that it was an authentic program, no only a group of experts that exchange ideas neither the celebration of meetings in exotic places of the Union.
Taking into account the circumstance that #such nuclear accidents do not detain  in the national borders, #would be now forced *decirles to the countries candidates to the adhesion to the European Union, #if they continue with his risky nuclear politics, looming in this way to #all the European Union -am thinking in *Temelin, in *Krsko, in *Bohunice and in *Mochovce, that under these conditions #can not neither has to produce any adhesion.
Lady Speaker, in the note that *le gave said that had the intention to pose the question of the visits of the President of Chinese to *Francia and to the Realm Joined, and his repercussions for the rapes of the human rights in Chinese, and the arrests effected by the police and his authoritarian performance in *Francia and in the Realm Joined.
In chamber place, after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the European Union has to answer also to #a lot of new requirements. I #can quote the fields of the inner politics, the space of freedom, security and justice, the chapter devoted to the employment or the greater possibilities in the field of the protection of the health and of the consumer.
It is necessary to set up a more conscious administration with the costs and has to delete the *despilfarro, of the that have been innumerable witnesses occasions and that the reports of the Court of Accounts have taken out to the light along these years, #if it wants  that the community citizens see in the community organs serious partners in the process of development of *Europa.
Clearly, follow being too much prompt to judge the results of the mandate of the #ECB, but, also to this *respecto, #can indicate already #a lot of positive signs, not being the minor of *ellos the that the investors are had to loan his money to the governments of the zone of the euro with some types of interest very low.
It has talked  here a lot of independence; and it is truth that, with the Treaty of *Maastricht, the that believed that the stability of prices was an indispensable condition for a development sustained and the that believed that to dominate the inflation was necessary a Central Bank, have won. And the that believed that it #can take  any thing with the monetary politics or with the economic politics with #such to grow in the short term and artificially, have lost.
Although *me *percato and appreciate that the wish to see published the votes or the records by part of the Council of Government do not appears in the proposal of resolution that will be voted tomorrow by his Parliament, in this debate has loaned  #a lot of attention, more of the that expected, to the phenomenon of the transparency, that culminates with the publication of the votes.
This wide evaluation covers an extensive series of indicators that include, of course, the evolution of the real economy, the variations of the employment and the unemployment, an analysis of the evolution of the type of change in so much have influence on the level of prices in the zone of the Euro.
In this same road, also have to register pleased the recent conclusion of the Presidency of the European Council of *Tampere in front of the bleaching of capitals, in the that signals  the decision of the Council to "guarantee that they give  the concrete steps to proceed to the follow-up, preventive embargo, seizure and *decomiso of the benefits of the offence" .
A realistic politics of the immigration #would have to consist, to the contrary, in hampering the situation of the immigrants in *Europa suppressing, in particular, #all political social -help that it is, by it other, the of the #american Congress-, diminishing the economic helps to the countries that boost the immigration and organising of systematic form the transfers until the border.
We need a big debate also on the geographic enlargement of the European Union, on his contents and demand to the Council of Ministers -the ladies and knights that are there represented- that have value to direct to *Europa to a positive future, as it treats  of the stability, of the peace and of the democracy in the century *XXI in our continent.
I expect that the Commission and *usted, in the proposal that *nos go to present, have the prowess to fly higher and know to motivate with *algo more exciting that the mere *refundición of the garbled texts of the Treaties, the need to define a constitutional part in the fundamental texts of the European Union.
Of course, still it has not inscribed any credit in this game, but, instead -and is my second point- has inscribed an enormous credit (60 millions of euros) in a reservation for the statute of the deputies, *algo quite garbled since this statute still do not exists, and that, anyway, although it approved  a statute of the deputies, is evident that #would not apply  in the current term of office.
Gentleman President, at any rate, wanted to remember that when deciding not raising the embargo against the #english bovine meat, *Francia do not takes in this case but apply the Treaty, that leaves the possibility to each State to forbid or to limit his imports by reasons of protection of the health and the life of the persons and the animals.
The first is that we are in the European Parliament and have celebrated, the past Friday, a debate without the Commission and without the report of the experts, debate during the *cual believe that the Assembly and, of course, my Group treated to situate the subject in the frame that *le corresponds, is to say, inside it that they are our competitions and our obligations like #european deputies, of face to #ours *conciudadanas and *conciudadanos.
As now we know that the cars are responsible of the 12% of these broadcasts; and that the persons that buys cars is not at all conscious that a vehicle also is an instrument *contaminante and of how much contaminates, whereas yes it knows, for example, how means the so much by one thousand of alcohol in the blood; *yo yes know that #if I buy a car that consumes three litres of fuel each 100 kilometres is a car of low consumption, is urgent that *concienciemos to the consumer of the pollution *ocasionada by the cars.
It is fundamental to boost the local initiatives of employment, support the social economy *garantizándole a juridical recognition, recognise really, even by means of public finance, to the *tercer sector, this form of economy that is arising among the traditional public sector and the yielding sector, based in the creation of activities useful for the life in society.
Gentleman President, treats  of an interesting report and of proposals that probably obtain *bastantes votes of the Parliament; but, further of it that *nos proposes the Commission, that consists simply, *me seems to me, in restarting the process of *Luxemburgo, poses  a doubt: why the Report *Monti do not occupies the centre of the worries *cuando shows clearly that the absence of convergence social and fiscal convergence slope put of work in #all the countries of the Union?
It Important is not the preparation of a catalogue of the rights, but achieve that #all have consciousness of it important that is the first infancy, to avert that in the following years configure  a society in the that the youngsters, by have not enjoyed of his rights during the infancy, #can not express by any half that was not the alteration of the order.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, in name of the Commission, wanted to *congratularme in the first place by the approval of the *dictámenes on the proposal of directive relative to the notification of the judicial acts and *extrajudiciales in civil and commercial matter, #as well as the proposal of regulation on the competition, the recognition and the execution of decisions judicial in matrimonial matter.
Therefore the question -and comprise and appreciate his fine will, gentleman Commissioner- is the following: it Is had the Commission, in front of the *hostigamiento and the pressures that are suffering #european companies, to take *algo more that express his consternation and his worry, and to take *algún type of measures -and to *ello engaged  his predecessor, the Mr. *Brittan, in front of this Parliament: I know it well because *yo *le formulated the question in his day- in the case that #that *incumplimiento follow being absolutely evident and *palmario?
Subject: Initiatives of the Commission to contribute to the preparation of the countries candidates to the adhesion The adhesion to the EU, and therefore to the inner market, of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental will involve a pressure in the field of the competition that will take that it accelerate  the process of changes structural in these countries.
With regard to the question of the transitory regulations that they #can request the countries candidates in the frame of this chapter of the negotiations for the adhesion, the basic point of the negotiations of the European Union consists in that #such measures only are possible in exceptional cases and for a term of #time and field of application limited.
In my Group exists an important number of pertinent members of neutral countries and no neutral that  *oponen *frontalmente to #all this idea to create an identity of defence #european, and the debate in the breast of the neutral countries is being conducted of a very deceptive way.
Here in this Parliament today has remained perfectly clear and the majority has been very sincere to the *respecto: they want an identity of defence #european, want an industry of armament #european that it was competitive and want a #european army; but nobody has consulted to the public opinion of the States members.
The European Union has to have an only goal: take part in the *restablecimiento of the peace, reach a statute for *Chechenia, of compliance with it foreseen in the agreement signed by *Rusia and *Chechenia on 31 August 1996, and has to likewise assume the commitment to remember that #this *Europa #if it wants to defend the human rights, #can not continue endorsing the fact that *Rusia consider the strength and the army the only instrument to take politics.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the continuation of the debate of the report (To5-0062/1999) of the Mr. *Schwaiger, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1999) 331 - *C5-0155/1999 - 1999/2149(*COS)) and to the European Parliament on the approach of the EU on the Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC
In effect, given the challenges posed, is evident that the next Round #can not limit to expand the normative frame, by important that *ello was, neither #can neither watch only so that the commercial liberalisation contribute to the economic and social growth of the less developed countries, although it share fully this goal, but that it has to also establish the norms that have to take effective the opening of the markets and guarantee the fulfillment of #the same.
And now, gentleman Commissioner, wanted to *preguntarle in the first place #if it confirms his intention of not accepting in the agenda of the next negotiations #any *reconsideración of the agreement on the textile sector in the preparation and, second, how considers that it goes to affect to the #european textile industry the entrance of Chinese in the World-wide Organisation of Trade, taking into account that this country is the *primer world-wide exporter of textile products.
Said #this, the round of negotiations of the *OMC do not serves to create *algo *supranacional, as it fears  often, that oust the international Rights or that prevent to take fluctuate the free market, but especially to give true rules to #all *nosotros, #as well as to watch by #some fundamental rights like the right to the health, the education or to the social functions in a frame of *salvaguardia of the rights of each citizen.
The liberalisation of the world-wide trade is a positive process that generates development and that it #can be hindered no only by the protectionist practices of the States, but also by the creation of situations of distortion of the competition like the abuses of position dominant, the cartels, the *dumping - think, for example, in the so hurtful - dockyards for *Europa.
In the field of the structural politics is evident, for example, that what greater was the number of States members, more #unlikely will be that they #can reach  reasonable decisions according to the principle of the unanimity, #if they pretend  apply the scarce bottoms, the scarce resources, so that they benefit really to the poor regions and to the poor groups of the European Union
Without embargo, the Council finishes to initiate, without expressing it clearly, an irreversible process that #can conduct it, #if nobody detains it, to award a mandate of negotiation complete to the Commission, and in this way, in application of the new article 133.5 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, *desposeer to #all the national Parliaments of his power of ratification definite, but always, obviously, without expressing it with clarity.
The Council expects that the guarantees that has given the provisional administration, as it designates , on the respect of the human rights and of the civil freedoms are respected without condition #any and that #all charge of indictment against the Prime minister *destituido, the Mr. *Nawaz *Sharif, was pursued inside the respect of the legality in front of a civil court and public.
To answer specifically to the question of the Mr. *Duff, the Union, after the coup d'état, has cancelled the signature of the new agreement of cooperation among the Community and *Pakistán, and have suspended our political dialogue, to send, simply, to the new masters of *Pakistán, a message on our worries with regard to the coup d'état and to his consequences.
As it is clear that the problem of the *Cáucaso #can not be solved of the form in that they want to solve it the Russians. Therefore same, *me seems very important that no *nos remain with the arms crossed, that the Commission take #his this call and loom with categorical measures, as for example the freezing of the new agreements *TACIS, and that the papers get to the offices of the #russian civil servants, so that we are not *nosotros the only in having all #this by writing.
Likewise, it takes lacking to concentrate our attention -and our budgetary efforts- in programs of evaluation of the practices that follow  in the field of the prevention, of the therapy and of the *reinserción, #as well as in the field of the social and sanitary consequences, so that the corresponding results guide to the countries members and candidates to the hour to trace his national politics.
Gentleman President, also *yo wanted to back the content of the #german initiative directed to improve the exchange of information on the documents of trip falsified and to reinforce the security of the borders of the European Union so much for States members like the *mio, the Realm Joined, that do not forms part of *Schengen, as for the that they find  in the perimeter of the European Union.
To finish, also expect that the #finnish Presidency remember to the Governments of the States members in the Council of *Helsinki that for the creation of an only market is necessary that allow  the acquisitions *transfronterizas and the restructuring of companies key without that produce  any political interference by part of the Governments of the States members.
In the forum of the human rights of this morning have talked with #one of the #finnish colleagues of the Speaker in pertinent exercise of the Ministry of Subjects External Finn on a concrete case on the that has treated recently the European Parliament, the case of #Alexander *Nikitin, a man that will be processed to #few kilometres of distance of *Helsinki by high betrayal.
*Nosotros, in the Parliament, adopt a resolution in the month of October that marks clearly the line that #would have to follow the European Parliament, although, as it has exposed  here -and has said it the Mr. *Poettering in name of my Group-, there are #some discrepancies inside our Group on the importance, the character and the scope that it is necessary to give to this candidature of *Turquía.
Without embargo, #this #can not suppose the suppression of #any of the requirements regarding the democratisation of the Constitution and of the political reality, a fundamental improvement regarding the respect of the human rights, a political solution of the problem *kurdo and the end of the occupation of the north of *Chipre.
Precisely by #this, *yo #can not approve #some of the amendments that obtained a majority backrest in the Commission of Environment and, especially, neither the that have presented the Mrs. *Breyer and his Group, #some of the *cuales are *superfluas and do not contribute to improve the text of the legislative proposal and #others do not have at all that see with the present proposal of directive, since they do not save relation with his field of application.
The public information has insisted in that the proposal of directive has a fundamental importance and offers the opportunity to back legal measures, included the right of the society to appoint and disfigure to the governments that do not adopt the necessary measures to fulfil this directive.
The Commission will take in account #this and will draft again the text of the following way: " The Commission studies the possibility to present suitable proposals for the harmonisation of the procedures of measurement of the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon of the pertaining vehicles to the category *M1, in compliance with the annex 3 of the directive 70/156."
There #be diverse questions that *nos follow concerning, like the cut in the finance, that remain out of the field of application sectors of increasing importance like the of the aquaculture, the *poca concretion of the informations that will receive the consumer -specifically the Mrs. *Fraga expressed it in regard to the distribution of zones proposed by the Commission-, or the fault of other notable data like the minimum size.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the proposal of the Commission of a new *OCM for the products of the fishing and the aquaculture do not attends adequately the needs and specificities of this sector in the diverse States members neither takes into account the potentialities that still exist, it that results so much more incomprehensible what that the own Commission recognises that the European Union matters the 60% of his consumption of products *pesqueros.
The report of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence encourages  in mentioning the question of the human rights. But, after having amended the proposal of the Commission, the report pronounces  in favour to continue the deepening of the Union *aduanera with *Turquía.
In the special report of the Court of Accounts on the activities of the *UCLAF have signalled a series of proposals that consider that they #would have to undertake the Parliament and the States relative members to the nomination of a #european public prosecutor and other measures to continue the fight against the fraud.
In *Dinamarca have had from the century nineteen a stupendous tradition of permanent education and precisely the writer, priest and #one of the creators of the #danish constitution, *N.*F.*S. *Grundtvig Appears like #one of the *pilares fundamental of #all the #danish movement of the popular upper schools. A movement that contributed to the education of the common persons in a period in the that #this was *algo out of it normal.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0075/1999) of the Mr. #Aparicio *Sánchez, in name of the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that it establishes  the distribution of permissions for the vehicles of transport heavy of commodities that circulate by Swiss. (*COM(1999) 35 - *C5-0054/1999 - 1999/0022).
Of course, regarding the statistical data on #whose base proposes  the granting of permissions for the vehicles of transport heavy, the data of the external trade that we have until today, essentially #can not be correct, since with the current limit of the 28 tonnes in Swiss, the transports by road to big distance, as for example from my country, from #Grecia, are not economically profitable and therefore do not make .
Certainly, with the forecast of the transmission of the return of the permissions that have not been attributed until 15 September, in place of 15 November that proposed the Commission, reduces  the possibility to be unfair in the final attribution, that has to take according to the real needs, and helps  to the companies in his programming.
It is essential that the citizens comprise the true goal of this package, since it do not treats  simply -although it is important- to warn the competition *tributaria disloyal or to guarantee the correct operation of the inner market, concepts #this, repeat, very important, but that to the majority of the persons #can seem bureaucratic or distant, but that treats , rather, to take *algo very concrete for the daily life in *Europa: it treats  to create places of work.
The achieve affirm the majority like rule in the Community, like base of the political operation of the Union (very important for the Parliament in the measure in that we #can *codecidir), the have the juridical personality, the that they include  in the Conference decisions that has taken the Council, as, for example, draft a Letter of rights fundamental... Bear how serve all #this #if it do not includes  in the Treaties?
The European Union has bent  also by means of the Presidency of *ustedes by an option *atinada when insisting in that the process of reform of the Treaties has to have concluded and go in in operation in the year 2002, to more take, so that it facilitate a prompt adhesion, because it is important to watch by that the process of reform do not convert  in the enemy of the process of enlargement.
The Commission *sufraga the greater part of the costs of administration of the Office of the #Alto *Comisionado for the Human Rights of *Colombia and finishes to approve a program *plurianual to support the human rights in the #andean region with a finance that rises to 11,5 millions of euros, roughly, the greater part of the *cual will go allocated to *Colombia.
Gentleman President, #any one that are the games of hands budgetary to fund the help to the reconstruction of *Kosovo, the Council, like the Parliament, denies  to tackle the true problem, that is the reconstruction of *Kosovo #as well as the reconstruction, also necessary, of Serbian, #would have to fund with charge to the military budgets of the responsible States of the bombardments.
#One of the most important decisions adopted during the last autumn has been the commitment contracted in the summit of *Helsinki, by means of the *cual the Community and his States members show his will to ratify the Protocol of *Kioto before the Conference of River 10, that will take place in the year 2002, and also will undertake #all the necessary measures so that said ratification was possible.
Our question is the following: how measured propose  adopt the Commission and the Council to guarantee that the Parliament converts  in a real speaker in the preliminary work, #as well as in the contribution of the European Union to "*Beijing more five" and in the official delegation of the European Union in the conference of New *York?
- Report (To5-0088/1999) of the Mr. #Miranda, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, on the communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course to 1 May 1999 in the field of the development and of the cooperation (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219/1999) Confirmation of the first reading: *COM(1994) 289 - *C4-0090/1994 - 1994/0167(*COD) - ancient 1994/0167(*SYN)
In the first place, wanted to congratulate to the speaker, Mr. #Aparicio *Sánchez, by the work that has carried out in relation with this question, and protest by that it have not received  the integral text of the agreement among the European Union and Swiss before that the part of the distribution of the permissions, that is not more that a part of the global agreement.
I believe that before June will be able to find the definite formula, that, as they know, do not bases  in the decision of the Commission -not even of the Council, #would say-, since it is thing of the Organisation of Nations Joined and those who take part are the states, but, in any case, repeat, give  the political will and the political budgets, since in #a lot of subjects the points of sight are identical, to advance together.
Obviously it will have competition in the field of the evaluation of the elements of risk and to evaluate said elements of risk, the scientists that work in the agency will not be able to depend only of his own opinions and criteria, but that they will have to consult also to other scientists of the States members. Because an agency of these characteristic -agency or authority or it that it was- no only will have to be independent, but besides will have to keep in contact with other scientists of the States members.
In the territory of the European Union there #be not a negative attitude in front of the legal immigration, but that the problem in himself/hisself is the existence of the illegal immigration and even of the illegal traffic of persons of third countries, problem that yes fits to combat; but it has not tried  in no way hamper the legal immigration.
Gentleman President, the rule on the procedures of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in virtue of the article 321 of the Treaty of the *CE, of the article 33 of the Treaty on *EURATOM and of the article 29 of the Treaty on the *CECA, establishes that the deliberations of the Court of Justice of the European Communities will be secret and will remain secretly.
Gentleman President, am entirely satisfied with the answer of the Council, but before concluding this session wanted to *preguntarle to the Presidency of the Parliament when will keep  the debate on the big group of questions proposed in the report of the Mr. *von *Wogau, in relation with the politics in matter of competition and of state subventions; in a principle, this debate had to have taken place already this morning, but has gone  delaying #some hours along the day.
The amendments only pretend to avert that the Bottom take *algo that in any case #can not take; the purpose of the Regulation proposed is to allow the continuation of the financial contribution of the EU to the Bottom. It do not pretends  in any case modify the essence of the current Regulation (*CE) *nº 2614/97, reason by the *cual approved  the procedure of urgency in the first place.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0089/1999) of the Round Mrs. *Jiménez, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Decision 96/411/*CE relative to the improvement of the community agricultural statistics (*COM(1999) 332  *C­0042/1999  1999/0137(*COD))
Of course, since the common agricultural politics is evolving of a situation in the that pay subventions in the moment of export or in the moment of entrance in intervention to a situation in the that subsidise each individual animal by acre or each hectare of crop planted, is evident the enormous importance that has know exactly how many animal there #be in the Union, how many hectares, how many *olivos, etc. #All this information is fundamental.
Subject: Statements of *Ecevit after the arrest of *Ocalan The #turkish Prime minister, Mr. *B. *Ecevit (The one who in 1974 gave the order of attack against the Republic of *Chipre, Been member of the Nations Joined and country candidate, in the actuality, to the entry in the EU), declared in front of journalists *tucos and foreigners, immediately after the arrest of the leader of the PKK, To. *Ocalan, that *Turquía will not accept indications of any #european country in relation with the trial of *Ocalan.
It #can indicate the Council #which were the reasons of the announcement of said informal extraordinary meeting, why was surrounded of #such reservation, #which were his conclusions and decisions, how paper is called to exert *Europol, how other services of police judicial national, international or Europeans are engaged in the application of the decisions quoted and #if #this affect exclusively to the organisations *kurdas or also to other organisations and movements that act in countries of the EU?
By it that refers  to the internal structure of the Commission, multiplied  the directives to end to give occupation to an every time greater number of Commissioners and, #if it continues  this impulse, as it goes  to happen of twenty to thirty Commissioners, go  to create again #others *tantas directions and his multiplication, that do not corresponds to an internal coherence, to the homogeneity of the tasks that exert, will give disastrous results.
In this sense, an important step that have to give to achieve this tuning among the community institutions and the citizens, #would be precisely the preparation of a code of behaviour that facilitate the relations of confidence among the civil servants and the public and that this code was accessible and comprehensible for the citizens.
It wanted to signal -now that are voting the questions related with the Commission of Rights of the Woman- that, obviously, in the amendments 1 and 2 relative to the Commission of Freedoms Public and of Inner Subjects and the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects has to remain clear that to said commissions no  *les #can attribute competitions in matter of discriminations in reason of the sex, since of *ello commissions  the Commission of the Rights of the Woman.
These two proposals are directed to open to other operators the new market of the broadcast of money electronic in a normative frame of neutrality from the point of sight competitive, taking into account, on the one hand, the interest that it develop  a correct competition in the sector and, by #another, the existent realities in #some States members.
The deputies to the European Parliament #can not take another thing that demand to the Commission that interrupt the cooperation in the frame of the Agreement of *Lomé and that beg to those who have designated  to himself/hisself same like leaders of the *Níger that respect the fundamental laws, that *restituyan the power to a civil Government and that respect the freedoms and the human rights.
But *yo #would want to signal that, not to persist in a bad tradition, at least #would be necessary to leave that it debated the subject the Commission of Regulation, since in my opinion #would be abusive or, anyway, an interpretation *tendenciosa, allow that a simple majority #can modify the competition of the commissions or, in any case, *vaciar of content #that in the that this relative majority did not assume the presidency.
In a note of 7 April, that directed to the Mr. *Priestley, #ours *jurisconsulto concluded: «a motion of censorship against the Commission #would be admissible to clear the juridical situation in the that finds  and to limit more the exercise of his powers, although it considers  that the value added, from the point of sight juridical, #would be quite feeble».
It #would wish to congratulate to the speakers for having reached incorporate #all the fundamental looks of this question: the situation of the greater persons in the labour market, his specific needs in the field of the training, the questions related with his *sustento and his needs regarding the services.
The different costs of production of the glucose in the industries of #EE.UU. And of the European Union #can suppose usually among the 30 % and the 100 % of the price of sale, inconvenient that is impossible to surpass by means of the technological advance or the increase of the productivity, even more taking into account that the majority of the #european industries suffer also of a disadvantage of size.
The recent evolution of the monetary variables, Mrs. *Metten, reinforce the confidence of the economic agents and have to have positive repercussions, especially in the behaviour of the private investment, but *usted knows perfectly that I never comment the decisions of the Central Bank European, not to be accused to transgress the *sacrosanto principle of his independence.
Of course that it is still insufficient and #that is the reason by the that have presented the *GOPE, precisely to put on the table an economic strategy, that follows  from takes years, and like the speaker has underlined, there #be not reason to change of economic strategy, to the contrary, it is necessary to keep the course and *redoblar the efforts to keep the growth and struggle against the unemployment.
The office did not has only the function of the external control; #this is, definitely, very important, as the States members are those who administer the 80 % of the community resources. The office will be also an independent guardian of the community interests in the breast of the organs and of the institutions of the Community.
The European Foundation for the Improvement of the Conditions of Life and of Work *subscribió a memorandum of understanding with the Agency of Health and Security to avert the duplication of functions, because #one of the things in that it insists the Parliament is the that it did not has to have duplication of functions in the work of these agencies.
There #be a big obstacle: the rule that the proposals of the States members for the application of the VAT reduced have to be approved unanimously by the Council, *cuando the VAT no longer is the base for the contribution of the States members to the European Union, argument that always was used to say that  *vaciaba this base.
As a result of a decision of the Council of *Viena of the pasts 11 and 12 December, the Commission finishes to present to the European Parliament a proposal of modification of the Directive 78/388/*CEE relative to the possibility to apply, with experimental character, a type reduced of the VAT on the services of big intensity of hand of drama.
*Permítanme That add a warning in relation with this point: more important that an abstract decision, adopted in the table of negotiations, on the definition of the borders and #who #can or #can not coexist with #who, will be to impose the fulfillment of some norms -some norms situated under the empire of the Right- and repress the command of the massacres and the *puñales.
*Nos Causes satisfaction the financial help and *macroeconómica of the World-wide Bank and the #FMI, but the EU will have to adapt his economic and financial politics, because the humanitarian help #can not never compensate the descent of the opportunities of export and counter the blockade of the links and communications with the Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0267/99) of the Mr. *Rothley, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens, on the project of decision of the relative European Parliament to the Statute of the deputies to the European Parliament (7528/2/99 - *C4-0217/99-00/0823(*COS)).
Regarding the information before the celebration of the agreement, the amendments occupy  of the information to the consumers before celebrating an agreement and the amendments refuse the concept of a right of reflection based in a project of agreement #such as it introduced it the proposal of directive.
The area of force covers to #all the products of consumption, so much new as of *segunda hand; the legal guarantee is of two years; in the cases of the products of *segunda hand, the States members will be able to decide, #if the buyers and the sellers #can agree mutually a limitation of the time of guarantee to a year.
The draft of statute contained #a lot of profitable things: a uniform wage that #would have made possible the payment of taxes national in the countries that like this had wished it, clear rules on statement of the interests of the deputies, transparency in matter of repayment of costs and repayment of the real costs of trip.
With these supports, the Parliament celebrated varied informal meetings with the Presidency of the Council and, with true satisfaction, have to stand out that the greater part of our aspirations have been collected by the Council, until the extreme that, after the European Council of *Berlín, has formulated  a new proposal of regulation titled now, at last, «relative Regulation to the Financial Instrument of Orientation of the Fishing».
In front of some initial and radical proposals directed to that the #european agriculture take more in account the indications of the market and the international references, finally has accepted  *matizar his terms and even exclude to #any of the sectors for reforming -as it is the case of the dairy products-, #whose reform postpones  for the campaign 2005 and that surely will see meanwhile aggravated his disequilibriums.
In front of the initial proposals to deepen the relation among agriculture and environment to put end to #some deteriorations reported, like the degradation of floors and of water, attacks to the biodiversity, etc., the Commission proposes in the horizontal regulation that are the States members the that they define the compulsory environmental norms and general and determine the sanctions, escaping like this of a community approach.
After having  subjected the case to the Court of Justice, #this, abandoning his jurisprudence *integracionista classical -that *perduró until the number of members got to nine-, limited  to take a strictly formal interpretation of the texts, against #all logical and against the fundamental principles of a coherent juridical interpretation.
The Agreement is composed of three main axes: the institutionalisation of a political dialogue to the highest level; the extension and deepening of our cooperation -to this *respecto foresees  explicitly and for the first time the cooperation in matter of human rights and democracy and include  fields so important like the social, the fight against the poverty, and the protection of the environment and of the consumer.
From a point of sight more essential, believe that it basic, in this question, is that the Parliament, the last day, pretends to subject during seven years to his successor and to the successor of his successor to a substantial limitation of the budgetary powers established in the Treaty, budgetary powers that this Parliament exerts, in general, by qualified majority.
The Group *Europa of the Nations has not voted positively the Report *Aglietta on the competitions of execution attributed to the Commission, mainly because the European Parliament treats to alter the sense of #some of the new disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to modify in own benefit the institutional balance.
Gentleman President, the resolution that finishes to approve the European Parliament on the method that it #would be necessary to follow to reform the #european institutions after the Treaty of *Amsterdam did not contributes, in our opinion, any improvement regarding the past, and will conduct, as of habit, to make operations of reform from up, without hardly have the initiative and the participation of the villages of *Europa.
It is the culmination sure enough of a long process in the that the Parliament and the European Union have exerted his paper, in the that without place to doubts the village of *Timor Oriental, with his fight, has exerted a paper determinant, but #can not leave to signal the importance of the diplomatic hit yesterday achieved by the Government of *Portugal in New *York.
In any case, in it that concerns to the European Union already *les have said that they have taken  already #all the disposals and *les announce more: already we are beginning to work, precisely to request of the #portuguese Government, in #any one of the hypotheses, in the need to increase the lines of cooperation with the territory, of course respecting the popular will.
It was necessary to expect to that the Palestinians renounced to the military methods, to that heaved  the civil disobedience by means of the *intifada and boarded  patient negotiations with an enemy that had by fascist and racist, it was necessary to expect, as, to #all #this so that the Palestinians reached to advance and put in foot a process of peace that has achieved now that a big part of the world was had to support his legitimate requirements to establish an independent State.
As *ustedes know, the Commission reacted immediately, communicating to the Boss of State Greater, Colonel *Azali *Assoumani, the disapproval of the European Union and calling his attention on the principles of our cooperation, #whose essential elements are the respect of the human rights, the democracy and the State of right.
We have got to the following commitment: place that did not exists a common position on the nomenclature, have been able to obtain a statement of the Council by the that promises to examine the position on said nomenclature, taking into account the amendments of the European Parliament and the results of the discussions that at present carry out in the frame of a second exercise *SLIM.
In the Union only has to  allow matter pertinent products of third countries #whose operators respect the social norms *promulgadas by the *OIT *atinentes to the conditions and to the length of the work, #as well as to the childish work, before that the Union impose these norms in the global frame of the international agreements that negotiates and, in particular, of the rounds of negotiations of the *OMC.
Will have #all the support of the Party of the European Socialists no only to effect the indispensable internal reforms -in *primer term, the statute of the deputies and the of the assistants-, but also to open wide open the windows of the institution to #ours *conciudadanas and to our *conciudadanos, in #all the *Europa of the Fifteen and further of his borders, because no only are building this palace, but also #one *Europa more joined.
#If we had not got to an agreement -and think in it that #would have meant, in the context of the beginning of the war of *Kosovo and the crisis in the that found  simultaneously the Commission, that the Summit of *Berlín had divided  without getting to a commitment-, *Europa #would have precipitated  in a grave historical crisis.
*Me Refer, of course, to the approval of the Diary 2000, that went a political exercise, diplomatic and of balance of own interests inside the very difficult Union, and to #all the consequences that derived  of the, maybe, greater problem of actuality, by his repercussions inside the own European Union, that has been the conflict of *Kosovo and #all the circumstances that have surrounded it and the consequences also that they derive  for the future.
*Cuando The Western European Union finally disappear, in addition to the national Parliaments, it will be necessary to have a Parliament that assume the #european responsibility and, in consequence, the competitions in matter of external politics, of security and of defence will owe *recaer increasingly in the European Parliament, so as to that in the European Union any field remain to the *margen of the Parliament and the democracy.
The consolidation of the peace broken in the legendary Field of the Blackbirds of *Kosovo *Polje demands that it exist an optimum collaboration among the international organisations involved, the Nations Joined for the return of the refugees, the *OSCE, of face to the democratic construction, and the European Union for the economic and social reconstruction.
I know that the money that *le has offered #Telephone hardly #can  justify with the description of a bunch of silver and, of course, is asking to cries the question of *cuán seriously will take the members of this Assembly to a company like #Telephone *cuando avenges to take pressure, as probably it will take on the subject of the review and the future legislation in this field.
In the last Council, as it already has mentioned the President of #the same, reached  a political agreement on diverse measures and previously had reached  in the Council of Ministers of Agriculture a political agreement on a rule referred to the biological crops and to his extension to the animal products.
Maybe already it is hour that *nosotros, like #european Deputies, have the *sensatez to recognise that *tantos years of agricultural politics European *nos have carried in fact to the almost total destruction of an agriculture of quality, *per know of small scale, and to an all-powerful industrial agriculture #european, to the *omnipotencia of some agro-industrial groups that only look for the lucre and that trick  of the public health and of the norms of quality.
In the bottom is a species of disaster natural and in fact #would have to say: we Are here in front of a subject for the European Administration; I want to support the defence that took the Deputy *Thyssen so that the Commission was more generous in this point and debate with the Parliament on how act in front of this type of situations in the future.
It is very clear that it has to be explicit and #if it already is implicit do not see *cual is the problem to ensure that it was explicit place to measure that happens the time the radioactive substances go to suppose an even greater danger and - as I finish to say - have had #a lot of luck that even it have not produced  a serious accident.
*Señorías, #if perhaps by contempt to the right of the minorities, by the expression of a hegemonic will of the great groups, adopts *usted an interpretation that go further of the letter, very clear without embargo, of the Parliament, wish to call the attention on the fact that it #would create a very important and hurtful precedent that #can go back *algún day against #any one of the groups or subgroups of this Assembly.
The meeting of the European Council in *Tampere the days 15 and 16 October is a historical attempt of *esbozar a common politics of the European Union in the fight against the international delinquency organised, in the creation of a space of justice #european and in subjects of immigration and asylum.
To #the same time know #which are the lean points of our credibility in front of the #european citizens. We do not waste this opportunity to involve to the no governmental organisations and to each #one of the citizens in the process of gestation of the Letter *sirviéndonos of an unknown formula to date.
Like this, it is precise that this Parliament, with the new attributions that *le conferred the Treaty of *Amsterdam, take #his the goal to advance to the creation of this space of freedom, security and justice respecting the national differences and taking always an effort to approximate *Europa to the citizens with clarity regarding the goals that pretends  achieve and to the form as they transmit  to the public opinion.
#This is a fully justified case, no only because it is a system that is not prepared for the "effect 2000" , but that, besides, takes into account a migration of systems and, is more, is #all a complicated system that goes to cover from the *primer moment, from the conception of the text, until the publication, without that it mediate any #another system, or was, that *yo believe that it is *algo that goes to leave to the Court of Justice in an optimum level for his work.
The cause of the enormous current suffering of the *timorenses is clear: the militias *proindonesias try to drown in a bath of blood the aspirations to a political independence of the big majority of the population. Attention!: It is the most absolute negation of the result of the referendum of 30 August 1999.
In this sense, *me add to the appeal formulated in this Plenary and also by the Senate of the Republic of my country, that foresees that the #european Governments and the UN recognise without delay the sovereign State of *Timor Oriental and that #this leave to be a subject tackled in scoop also in this Plenary. #This honours to the #portuguese deputies and to the deputies of #any another nation.
Subject: A common defence of the EU In the course of the campaign for the #european elections, the #swedish Prime minister, *Göran *Persson, affirmed that it is impossible that the idea of a common defence of the EU materialise , since *Suecia will put the so prompt veto like the subject go out to *relucir.
Gentleman President, like the Mr. Deputy knows, in the article 17 of the Treaty of the Union determines  that " the politics of security common covers #all the questions related with the security of the Union, included a politics of defence that will go  defining gradually and that it will be able to end in a common defence #if the European Council like this decides it" .
*Él Said that an army of the Union #would be unnecessary, extremely expensive and directly harmful for the relations with #EE.UU. *Permítanme Then add that *nosotros do not want a community army and that are not members of the NATO but, still like this, the same that the immense majority of the #swedish village, his government and the party that represent, want that the EU take greater responsibility in the peace and the security of *Europa.
Subject: juvenile Delinquency, drugs and the European Council of *Tampere How guarantees #can give the #finnish Presidency that the European Council on subjects of justice and inner that will celebrate  the next days 15 and 16 October in *Tampere will adopt a common strategy that have like goal tackle the juvenile delinquency and transmit a clear message in the sense that the EU will not adopt a politics *permisiva in matter of drugs?
With the often listened western confidence in the social institutions parallel #Kosovar, is to say, in the state in the #albanian shadow during the pasts ten years, like point of ideal link for a new beginning for this apple of the territorial discord, fits anyway a critical observation. In #some essential social fields this advantage applies  without more.
The budgetary transparency is evidently necessary, as it proposes the Parliament, to take a clear distinction among the contribution with charge to the community budget and the contributions of origin distinct, #as well as to distinguish among the cost in the physical reconstruction and in the creation of institutions.
Happening to the relative specific observations to the rapes of the human rights, posed by the Mr. *Zimeray, Mr. *Morillon and the *Srta. *Malmström, wanted to say that the #finnish Presidency is *ultimando the *démarche of the troika of the relative Union to the convictions to the pity of death of four students, management that includes the opinions expressed by this Parliament.
With reason of the scandal of the *EEB, are promoting the restructuring of the scientific committees of the European Union, so that the scientists are designated by means of a public procedure, that know  his path and his financial interests, that the agenda of the sessions, the records and also the minoritary opinions spread  through Internet.
Therefore, to take #this, the Union will have to invest more in the security of the alimentary chain, in each stage of the process, and decide for example - already has talked  of *ello - on the utility or no to create this agency, this famous independent agency for the alimentary security, that was inspired in the #american example or in #another.
The paper that the regions and the historical nations of the EU #can exert in the creation of bonds economic and cultural with the diverse regions of *África is decisive and has to be an essential previous requirement for his perspectives in the future, as also the elimination of the debt.
It is a history that knew  in the year 1997 and, when seeming, up to now has not taken  at all so that the persons involved have received the just punishment and to initiate, by part of the Commission, an investigation in depth, of course *quitándoles the agreement to the persons that in this moment have it and that they are the managers of the situation that there has created .
How data #can offer the Commission on *España and the EU in relation with the evolution of the crop of the linen, the perception of subventions, the control of the requirements to avert the fraud, the resultant transformation oriented to his commercialisation and the fires *providenciales become in some transformative companies?
Therefore, #if, by a part, so much like #christian Catholic and like political man have to take upsetting in the need that in *Turquía show  specifically a greater respect of the civil rights and of the fundamental values, in particular in matter of human rights, by #another, it is necessary to consider that #all the commitments assumed by *Turquía with the Community in the last years so much in matter of external politics as of cooperation and of economy, #as well as in the cultural field, have fulfilled  in #all moment.
The European Union bases his identity in the fact to be a State of right, that is a very important step and a much more significant condition that coin a common coin or reach a politics of defence common.
Firstly, the rejection of the #turkish Government to recognise the genocide committed in the past against the *armenios; second point: the fact to show  *renuente to apply the norms of Right international in his *litigios with #Grecia; *tercer point: the maintenance of troops #turkish of occupation in *Chipre; chamber point: the negation of the fact *kurdo.
I communicate to the Assembly that, in the meantime, has gone taking seat in the official grandstand a delegation of the National Institute of Administration of the Chinese Popular Republic under the direction of the Mr. *Wang *Zhongyn, member of the Council of the State and General Secretary of the Council of Subjects of the State.
To continuation, exists the need to define norms and to consolidate the institution, is to say, the *OMC, to strengthen his character *multilateral, improve the effects of the globalisation on the sustainable development and warn the risks for the environment and the health, inherent to a no oriented confluence among national norms and levels of different production.
Likewise I receive with satisfaction the frankness with the that the Mr. *Lamy has initiated his relations of work with this new Parliament, #as well as his support to the modification of the Treaty in the next conference *intergubernamental, of face to reinforce the paper of the European Parliament in the common commercial politics.
In this sense, and previously to the adoption of measures like the tax on the energy, it #would be necessary to ensure the adoption of these strategic performances, #as well as the reliability of the measures of production of gases of effect *invernadero, so that we #can make an effective follow-up of the evolution of the problem in #all the countries.
Therefore I ask to the Assembly that approve no only the resolution against the pity of death, but also the amendment that adds the following section: "The European Parliament takes an urgent call to the Governor of *Pensilvania, so that it abstain  to sign a new mandate of execution against *Moumia *Abou #Jamal and go back to present the appeal of review of his process" .
The drivers of the vehicles of engine of two and three tyres have to respect in #all moment the limits of speed in vigour in the States members and #that #would not have to have possibility to allege the nonexistence of legislation on this matter to avert the consequences #if *infringen the limits of speed.
Gentleman President, wish to call the attention of this Parliament on the fact that the project of budget 2000 has not foreseen to endow to the line *B1-3800 relative to the promotion of the agricultural products, #whose amount allows only clear the past, and wanted to give the thanks to the speaker of course, #Jean-#Louis *Bourlanges by his understanding #as well as to the support of the gentleman *Böge and of the gentleman *Görlach.
*Me Refer to the point 11 in the that it says  that the Parliament considers that "the reduction of 0,50 points in the types of interest of 8 April 1999 was a positive measure and approves the reasons of #the same" , leaving to understand that the descent of the types has *sustentado the economic politics generals of the Community.
In so only little more of a year, by means of the dialogue, have agreed already a diary of negotiation that comprises twelve points, and the past Sunday, in a historical fact in our nation, have given start to the process of negotiations that have to conduct to our homeland by the *senda of the construction of a true and durable peace.
Besides, there #be another important dimension, lady Speaker, and is that *nos find in this moment in doors of the new wave of enlargement, as it has said the President in exercise of the Council, and also are living a series of results electoral that constitute a clear warning for #all *nosotros in the measure in that determined xenophobe and racist attitudes are *incidiendo in the population of #some of our countries.
The problem of the women and of the boys exploded and directed to the prostitution, and the relation among these worlds and the drug trafficking, in addition to being great problems from the point of sight of the public security, are, from the point of sight human, *algo dramatic and *penoso that requires our concrete intervention.
I wish to underline that the Commission #would not have been able to exert his paper, #if it had not been able to have the support of the #finnish Presidency and in particular of the Prime minister Mr. *Lipponen, to the that wish to appreciate once again his cooperation and his work in *pro of the hit of *Tampere, #as well as with the support, always critical and watchdog, of the European Parliament.
Among the prudence and the temerity, among the realism and the utopia, there #be -are convinced- a place and a path for a true reform of our institutions, for a more effective operation and more democratic of the Union, no to delay the enlargement, but to reach that it was a hit.
In the relative question to the external politics and of security, this report squanders long -to the equal that the Bosses of State and of Government- in analysing the development of the politics of security and when taking #this forgets that the politics of security is a function of the external politics.
Of course I am conscious of the special importance that the European Parliament attributes to two questions in particular: the first is relative to that the headquarters of the Agency establish  in *Salónica and his centre of operations in *Prístina, to that his mandate extend  to #all the western region of the *Balcanes and to that his activities situate  in the frame of the Pact of Stability.
In the political part will begin the day 8 November and will be the first time that feel  in the table the social speakers that express his social restlessness by the problem of the employment, the banks, that express the monetary politics, and the States members, that are the political powers of *Europa.
Gentleman President, gentleman representative of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, finish *ustedes to remember, of form very complete, the importance that *reviste this treaty of prohibition, directed essentially to strengthen the disposals of the Treaty of no proliferation and, together with *él, to keep under control the development of the nuclear arms, to limit, therefore, the proliferation of said arms and of the necessary technologies for his manufacture.
I have tested, without embargo, to substitute the young "word" by the elderly "word" in the program that are debating and have checked that went out an extraordinary project, fully valid, because, as it said the Mrs. #Taylor is true that #this is the first generation that has a #european identity and, as it said the Mrs. *Gröner, that the future of *Europa begins with the youngsters.
The liberal-democrats of the Realm Joined vote in favour of this budgetary line, #such as it has been proposed by the Commission of Budgets, but has to celebrate with previous character a debate to know the substantive points of *D. #Jan *Mulder, Member of the European Parliament, and find more financial resources inside the global without reducing the reservations neither request to the Commission that provide new bottoms.
. (*FR) The Group *Europa of the Nations has associated  to the common resolution on the restructurings of companies in front of the globalisation, since #the same reveals the beginning of a new mentality, *distanciándose, in part, of the *librecambismo and, to #the same time, asks that it focus  the international trade "in function of the most complex goal of the sustainable development" .
I want to appreciate especially to the Mr. *Fischler his punctual presence, #as well as my gratitude by the fulfillment of the promise that took in front of the Commission of Fishing, in the audience of the day 30 August, *cuando *nos said that it #would give priority to the Agreement of fishing with *Marruecos, it that #can corroborate  by the rapidity in formulating a proposal of mandate of negotiation.
Regarding the real application of the norm of more of thirty months, that means that any animal that have more of 30 months of age #can go in in the alimentary chain, and to the methods improved to delete the material of risk signalled of the bovine skeletons, are conditions that fulfil  thanks to the application of the measures of control before signalled.
Sure enough, our #british friends have taken cautions in relation with the *rastreabilidad, have introduced a passport for the bovine, has suppressed  the flours from 1990, have modified  the conditions of the slaughtering, have withdrawn  the ganglions, the spinal marrow, the lymphatic tissues, only export  the bovine lower of thirty months.
It has been an inferior behaviour to the planned for the first part of the year and, without embargo, the upward tendency that goes  to produce in the *segunda splits of the year will favour a next growth to the 3% for the average of the two last years, reaching with *ello alike figures or even upper for the year 2000 to the that had foreseen in the forecasts of spring.
In #Italia, the *concertación with the social speakers has blocked #all the strategies and the hypotheses of reform of the crucial points: I think in the market of work, think in the public cost and, in particular, in the social cost, a law in matter of labour market that is a calque of the of the years 70.
It wanted to remember to the Parliament that the Council adopted the past month of June the Directive 99/63, that incorporates to the community Right the agreement on the ordination of the time of work of the persons of the sea, subscribed by the social speakers of the sector of the maritime transport.
I coincide with the speaker in that it has to support this cooperation in #all the Latin American area and facilitate the advance of the negotiations of the agreement with *Mercosur, agreement that -all it is necessary to say it- believe that it is a bit unemployed person or, said of another form, has not gone to the speed that expected the year 1995 *cuando approve it and *cuando signed  the agreement of adhesion among the European Union and *Mercosur in *Madrid.
Also *me #would enjoy to stand out that we are in front of a good example of how a country that still has not reached his maximum quota of development, through this agreement of cooperation scientific and technological goes  to engage to a form of growth sustained and respectful with the environment thanks to the use of energies renewable.
The present managerial offers to the consumer the possibility to adopt a decision based no only in the power and the maximum speed, but also in the broadcasts of CO2 and purchase a car taking in consideration also a list, a hierarchy, of the ten more favourable from the point of sight of the consumption.
In effect, although we #can share the idea that the helps or stimuluses to the employment #can not subject totally to some conditions of control *tecnocráticas and rigid that loom with excluding of said helps to a part of the applicants of employment in difficulties, our conception *nos induces to propose no a control, but a positive and constructive support in the steps that give , the *cuales, already know it, follow being difficult.
The trucks and the cars of line are *causantes of an every time greater part of the pollution, given our big progress in relation to the broadcasts of the tourisms by means of the improvement in the quality of the fuel and to the fiscal facilities, #such as it finishes to say the Mrs. *Myller.
It is not necessary to clear that the European Parliament has to support #all a group of measures to control the environmental pollution, to end to apply the Agreement of *Kyoto, in the that it established  the obligation to reduce a 8% the level of broadcasts of six gases of effect *invernadero in the European Union, for the years 2008-2012.
The common position mentions on purpose to the victims of exploitation and sexual abuse that will be covered by the program, #as well as the common establishment of priorities, promoting the innovation and the exchange of experiences on the actions undertaken by the States members, included an exchange of information on the different legislations and the results obtained.
The already posed suggestion to create a unit for the boys inside the Commission believe that it deserves a study, especially to ensure that they will take  in account the human and financial resources available in these moments.
When presenting the *PRS 4 and in the dialogue to three bands, the day 7, before the adoption of #that *PRS 4, the Commission already *nos announced that the credits of payment supplementary and necessary -650,5 millions bear in particular *PHARE, *TACIS, *Obnova and *FYROM - covered  or went  to cover by means of three instruments: the *PRS 4, the global transfer and the *PRS 5, that today is the object of our debate and of the resolution.
It #would be an error that this reference to the nuclear energy distracted the attention of the main look of this report, that is the improvement of the energetic efficiency, the #obtaining of greater supply from renewable sources and the integration of our environmental goals in our energetic politics.
Also I ask to the Commission that support to the Commissioner *Byrne in his management to adopt a preventive attitude in the assistance of health public watching by the protection of the attention of the patients and the health and the training of the doctors of hospital no specialists.
#This is for me especially problematic as the fact that the negative resolutions are not considered like *vinculantes in #all the States, to the dessert #can mean that in the State in that it has produced  a negative resolution do not find recognition the positive resolution of another State, so that it arise again a disparity on it how is right in the European Union and #this is it that do not want that it occur.
#Many of *nosotros, varied States members of the European Union already have confronted the subject of the tutor of the boy precisely in the moment in that the families cross an especially difficult situation of his life as it is the separation of the spouses, with #all the effects - especially in psychological terms - that finish *repercutiendo in the boys.
Gentleman President, is clear that with the directive that proposes the European Commission steps  important in the path to the creation of a common space of freedom, protection and justice by means of the *comunitariarización of the judicial collaboration and the approval of norms only in the sector of the private international right, in #where, really, there was a big gap.
I have to say sincerely that, in front of the correlation of strengths in the country and to the fact that the disposal to the closing of *Kosloduj goes  to employ against the Government in the next elections that are just around the corner, the steps that has given the #bulgarian Government up to now are in front of this background some brave steps. *Algo Similar goes to happen in *Eslovaquia and *Lituania.
The question formulated by his mate, the Mr. *Samuli *Pohjamo *me gives the opportunity, *Señorías, to remember the method that use to establish the list of regions admissible for the Goal 2, #as well as the modalities of programming respecting the general regulation of the Structural Bottoms.
The foundation of my question is very clear. Among the 15 and the 20 percent of the women are abused during the pregnancy, the 50 percent of the women murdered have been victims of his husbands or *convivientes; the violence is the greater threat that  *cierne on the women, #a lot of greater that the rounds and the accidents of traffic together; only the two or three percent of the rapists are imprisoned.
Finally, I appreciate that our colleague *Schwaiger have insisted in the principle of caution, with the end to integrate the environmental politics in the commercial politics, and share his restlessness on the risks of a supposition *ecoproteccionismo that #would not have at all that see with the defence of the health of the citizens.
The amendments 12 and 33 serve to recess the costs of collection until the 10 percent for the quantities established after 31 December of the 2000; #this #can complement with a flexible premium, in function of the results that the States members reach with the collection of the traditional own resources and the measures of fight against the fraud.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, is undoubted that the greater commercial development and the new challenges that has generated the globalisation, #as well as the need to consolidate a commercial system *equitativo that contribute to a sustainable development and #whose benefits reach also to the less developed countries, demands a reinforcement of the norms that govern the international trade.
In this Assembly have given priority to the protection of the consumers, have established the familiar agricultural exploitations like the agricultural model and like basic unit of production, have converted the rural development and the conservation of the rural communities in the second *pilar of the reform of the *PAC.
Like this, the action "#european market" will happen of a 5 % to *X %, the internal helps will be residual, the helps to the export will have condemned , the rights *arancelarios, the beaks *tarifarios no longer will be, the direct investments will have obtained  thanks to *Lamy, to fault of the *AMI, and the market will have converted  in world-wide, a species of *Fukuyama commercial, an end of the history of the *GATT.
In my opinion, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical, takes  upsetting in that it has to modify the frame of the organisation and procedure of the Court and of the Court of First Instance to end to surpass the delay that exists in this moment, and believe that #this has to go further of a redistribution of the halls and of the increase of the number of judges.
*Nos *oponemos Also to the idea of the *constitucionalización of the Treaties, #as well as to the integration of the future Letter of Fundamental Rights in constitutional process European #any, as we follow considering that the #european citizenship only complete the national citizenship and, therefore, the formulation of the duties and the fundamental rights of the citizens of each nation competes to the citizens of said nation.
Of this way #would be surely to the height of the circumstances, to the height that sues the reality and #would give  fulfilled answer to the challenge to recover the interest of the citizens by the process of construction #european; interest -mathematically shown- low, in accordance with the level of abstention registered in the *comicios of 13 June.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, the Council, like the other Institutions, takes use of his competitions @atener to the conditions and to the goals that have been determined, by a part, by the article 5 of the Treaty of creation of the *CEE, #as well as by the modifications and additions executed by the back Treaties, and, on the other hand, by the disposals of the Treaty of the European Union.
In place to proclaim *urbi *et *orbi the need of #granting #european, better #would be that the Commission reaffirmed vigorously the need to correct, in the interest of #all, the lacks and the errors of the agreement of *Marrakech regarding the fundamental social rights, to the environment, to the public health.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #would wish *expresarles in #few words that my generation had the luck of not knowing the slaughtering of the #algerian in #París, in 1961, of have not lived, on 9 November 1938, the "night of glass" neither the start of the persecutions of the #jewish in the different countries of *Europa, and especially the luck to assist at the end of the apartheid in *Sudáfrica.
In virtue of the agreement of association and cooperation, that no only is *vinculante bear *Rusia but also for *nosotros and that includes a clause on the human rights, *nosotros as EU also are forced to struggle acutely by the Mr. *Nikitin, by the improvement of his conditions of seclusion, by his put in freedom and, as already it has said , by a just deal according to the State of right.
His reaction gives more weight to our opinion that in the previous diet there were #a lot of bad things, for example the fault of protection of the rights of the religious minorities and the every time greater abuse of the Law of blasphemy that  *promulgó after the military coup d'état of 1958.
For the future no longer #can be sufficient that the bank limit  to the *comprobación isolated of individual projects -for example a tract of motorway- also has to evaluate the projects in a context -for example in the frame of a plan of development of roads- to be able to recognise eventual duplicities and to develop an assimilable and financially sustainable alternative.
Gentleman President, *me #would enjoy to take two comments, #one on the fundamental object of the subject of debate of today, the guarantee of the budgets of the Union to the external loans of the *BEI, and #another on the subject that see that it concerns especially to the Assembly, the elements of transparency and the fine utilisation of the resources of the Bank.
This modification establishes three or four very important changes: in the first place, Canarians incorporates  to the Common Agricultural Politics and to the Politics *Pesquera Common; second, it incorporates  to the Union *Aduanera community, with which remains subjected to the ordinary community tariffs; and in *tercer place, disappear the figures of taxation special that had, specifically the *arbitrios insular -the called diet of special fiscal licence-, directed to protect the local industry.
Like consequence of this reference to the article 299.2 and of the philosophy that am exposing in this moment, the Commission of Subjects Juridical has proposed a series of amendments to the annexes of the regulation so as to that it do not continue the disarmament *arancelario in #any of the concepts that in this moment are valid.
After the Council of Ministers of Industry, the past day 9, and the report of the Commission on the situation of the world-wide market of the naval sector, produces  today this statement of the Commission in front of the Parliament, it that indicates that it exists a restlessness generalised in the breast of #all the #european institutions.
Thus, I ask to this Assembly, that represents to #all the citizens of the European Union, the solidarity with the #basque society in defence of the freedom, of the respect to the laws and of the peaceful coexistence that from takes so much time #all long for, with the conviction that, from the tolerance to the other and the love to the life, will reach the peace.
I believe that we have to contribute of constructive and serious form to that produce  a public debate on the European Union in #all the States members, and #can reach it #if, for example, leave to talk of the absurd matters that move away the attention of the real problems that treats the European Union, this type of matters that alleges #all the delegation headed by the Mr. Go give *Berg.
Also *me engage explicitly to offer to the European Parliament a wide previous information on the concrete steps that go  to give, also regarding the projects that will develop  and will execute jointly with *Turquía, of compliance with the relative regulations to the finance, so that the participation of the European Parliament in the development of the relations with *Turquía will be guaranteed in any case.
*Yo Believe that it is very important that the EU establish for the first time a value wide limit for a substance *carcinógena and, precisely because of his high risk for the health, specifically to the risk of cancer, but also by his hurtful repercussions in relation with other substances *carcinógenas still no regulated, is essential that the value limit that establish  in this directive begin  to apply it prompter possible in the practice.
It #would wish to ask to the Commission #if it #would not have to take an initiative to call the attention of the Central Bank European and of the national central banks on this problem, to know: the necessary change of #all the #european coins that will disappear in 2002 with the effective introduction of the euro.
Like European Commission, like European Parliament, like Government of the States members have to set up also a new initiative, so that the political discussions on the value of the euro do not conduct to that the citizens and the citizens think that they live in the Monetary Union, but that #this no *les has contributed any value added European, but that live merely in a period of a new monetary reform.
In reality, the problems and the contradictions of the world-wide economy continue on the table, no resolved and current: the doubts on the organisms modified genetically, the exploitation of the childish work, the negative social repercussions of a process of globalisation wild and without rules. But there #be more.
And we have to take patent also that here it has struggled  *duramente by the environmental criteria and by the security of the alimentary products, that here, in the European Union, achieve #this with difficulties, that the legislation is argued and *cuando reach *fijarla, take it owing to our responsibility in front of the persons of the European Union , in front of the *cuales are forced to *rendir explain in our condition of deputies and deputies chosen, and no by reasons of a tactical protectionism.
It finishes  to say that we wanted to more money because for *nosotros the training and the continuous training *revisten a special importance for the reduction of the unemployment, for the achievement of new places of work, for the strengthening of the economic enclave, social and of employment that is *Europa and for the good operation of the inner market, that precise like previous condition a formative space European.
The measures adopted to cut across the degradation of the coat of ozone are considered like #one of the hits of the international environmental legislation, and from mediated of the ninety seem to have *ralentizado the reduction of ozone, mainly thanks to the efforts for reducing the broadcasts of substances that exhaust the coat of ozone.
Although the Commission feels affinity by the amendment 20, that #would forbid the production of products that contain *hidroclorofluorocarburos for the export during the three following years to the corresponding prohibition of his use in the country, have to keep the balance among the suitability for the environment and the risk that the production displace  to other countries.
Gentleman President of the Council, his work, the of his Minister of Subjects External and also the of the minister *Kimmo *Sasi are a proof that the States members smaller also #can make a fine work and *nosotros appreciate it very especially, since it has been the first occasion in the that the #finnish Republic assumed the Presidency of the Council.
But, when receiving, as we take it, with *beneplácito this decision, insist in that these strengths *modernizadoras have to reach with determination advance to the fulfillment of the #european norms of respect of the human rights and of the relation among civil and military society, to the abolition of the pity of death, to the clear respect of the minorities, in particular the minority *kurda of *Turquía.
My question is, therefore, the following: #if they have  to *incoar already a procedure by *incumplimiento of the Treaties, without expecting to know at least the results of said proofs, *cuando #this not even have made  -the Mr. *Byrne still has to present a proposal- and *cuando even do not has  neither of logistical means to guarantee the identification, how #can pretend that *Francia and *Alemania raise already his restrictions to the import in these conditions?
As of habit, the requirement of efficiency to justify the action of the European Union sees  again prejudiced, and will not go back on the political decisions that have produced  neither on the negotiations that have agitated the main part of the budgetary debate among the Council and the Parliament.
Therefore, Mr. *Liikanen, to the *preguntarle #if it #can *usted resolve #this quickly, with his colleague the Mr. *Monti, also *le ask to the Commission that establish an agile mechanism and adapted to treat these subjects in the future because, while we do not have it, the car industry European will see affected his world-wide competitiveness, and will not be able to obtain #all the possible advantages of the diet proposed by the Mr. *Bodrato.
Gentleman President, #one of the greater challenges in the fight by a sustainable development is the reduction of the enormous broadcasts of CO2 and *me #would enjoy to underline to mood of introduction that the atomic energy is not a source of energy renewable and that thus it #can not be included inside the flexible mechanisms of *Kioto as, for example, the mechanism in favour of the sustainable development.
It is to say, that *Macao represents *emblemáticamente almost five centuries of peaceful coexistence and of reciprocal advantages in a frame of the most diverse diplomatic activities, cultural and mercantile, allowing the contact among the #european civilisation and the #chinese civilisation, the promotion and the protection of the external trade of Chinese and an important expression of the #european interests.
Gentleman President, the Court of First Instance derogated in his sentence of 17 June 1998 the decision 174/95, adopted by the Council on 6 July 1995, according to the *cual the *demandante did not have right to receive determined documents of *EUROPOL neither even receiving to the decision of the Council 93/731/*CE on the right of the citizens to access to the documents of the Council.
The Council adopted in 1996 the decision that the States members of the EU took part in the plan of action strategic of the World-wide Organisation of Customs for the route of the *Balcanes, #whose goal is to speed up the international cooperation and the development of the fight against the illegal traffic, especially in the region of the *Balcanes.
Subject: Program integrated for the insular regions of the *UEA the light of the articles 154 and 158 of the Treaty of the EU and of the Statement *aneja to the Treaty of *Amsterdam (30), the *DG *XVII of the Commission has elaborated a communication on the resource to the renewable energy in the insular regions of the EU.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, my question refers  to a special type of islands, those included among the regions *ultraperiféricas that collects the section 2 of the article 299 of the new Treaty of *Amsterdam, for the that foresees a special statute; but it treats  of a question for #whose answer, probably, the Mr. *Verheugen will not have not even that consult his notes because I believe that *él was present in the night of the European Council of *Berlín.
But yes *me #would enjoy *formularle a very concrete question, that did not refers  to a philosophical approach but simply to the fact of #if the Presidency in exercise considers that the European Community is a Community of Right, and that the juridical norms, in this case the Treaties, only conceive  qualified by the obligation of *cumplirlas.
The Commission has to draft an agreement of adhesion and establish a program of assistance financial for the previous period to the adhesion, to end to help to the authorities of Malt to satisfy the economic difference that follows having among Malt and the European Union.
Regarding the most known sector of *Polonia, the agriculture, and already said it also the Mrs. *Hoff, am entirely in accordance with the analysis of *ella of the that gives off the need to get more far with the structural reforms, especially in the terrain of the rural development and the improvement of the veterinary and phytosanitary services.
In #some cases, for example in the field of the recognition of the academic titles or the professional aptitudes, the granting of the social provision and the environmental risks, our work has given his fruits and even have been able to solve the problems of the *peticionarios.
Gentleman President, gentleman Defender of the Village, *me pleases that we #can get here to an unanimous agreement in the sense that, until the moment, the Defender of the Village has shown to be a very important figure for the EU and, especially, an institution of special importance to the hour to reach a greater transparency in the Union.
That the bombardments and the military offensive of the NATO in *Yugoslavia continue and cause the destruction of a country and the death of a number *indiscriminado of persons, #serbian and #kosovar, men and women, elderly and boys, as it occurred yesterday same to more of half hundred of refugees, interests little to the majority of this Parliament, that only regrets the loss of lives human and the «collateral damages».
We request firmly to the Commission that make an active follow-up of his operation in relation with the protection of the consumers, that watch also of active way the fulfillment of the recommendations on the security of this type of means of payment and that, with the greater shortness, undertake the necessary measures to protect to the consumers.
Now well, gentleman Commissioner, *nosotros, in the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary, consider that the electronic money in his different variants is extraordinarily important to implant it more quickly possible the euro before they exist the notes and the coins: already it was in form of virtual money integrated in the computers by the electronic trade or in form of cards *interoperables.
Gentleman President, know that the Commission and the Council already have reserved #a lot of money to support the elections. Without embargo, *me amazes that, although the Parliament insists year after year in the question of the democracy in Indonesian and the groups of the opposition request now that they send  observers of the Parliament, the Table of the Parliament have decided not sending observers.
These circumstances show the importance that *reviste the national component in the direction of the bodies of #Aduanas.3.el report represents an affront against the States members put that, in spite of the contrary position of the Council, tries *instituir a normative #conflictiva.4.es possible establish fully an effective cooperation among the authorities *aduaneras of the distinct members in the plane *interestatal.- Report go *Dam (To4-0114/99)
Check that from the dissolution of the commission of follow-up on the *EEB, the #decease of the persons victims of the illness of *Creutzfeldt-#Jakob follow accelerating of way very alarming (10 dead persons in the last quarter of 1998), since, even today, the #decease occurred in Big *Bretaña follow being object of register, and taking into account the period of incubation of 5 to 30 years, still will produce  #a lot of cases of illness, because of the variant of the *EEB.
This paradoxical way to proceed, that consists in taking out a positive conclusion of a definitely negative fact #can not, obviously, take wane our interest by the cases of bad administration reported to the Defender of the Village and by the form in that #this answers to the catchwords of the #european citizens.
The no governmental organisations and the deputies of the European Parliament #can, and even #would have to, suggest a clearer approach -a game of guidelines easier to use by the interested- that of this way #can be more pertinent and more effective to reach the goals *apetecidos.
Said motion of censorship is expression of the principle of confidence parliamentary, that has seen  reinforced from the Treaty of *Maastricht with the norms that recognise the parallelism among the length of the term of office and the of the mandate of the Commission, #as well as the approval, by part of the Parliament, of the nomination of the Commission and his president.
This report is the result of the conference that celebrate in October on the persons of age advanced, in the that presented  the opinions of the citizens of age advanced of the Community, it that they #can wish for the future and the type of recommendations that #would take for the International Year of the Third Age of the Nations Joined.
In the recent study of the European Union on the politics of the agricultural helps in the #EE.UU. Hardly it takes  reference to this subject, although the current *farmbill American has introduced the instrument of the compensation by commercialisation for practically #all the important agricultural products because of his big efficiency in the field of the competitiveness.
*B4-0156/99 of the deputies *Estevan *Bolea, *Malerba, *Ligabue, *Danesin and *Castagnetti, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European; -*B4-0158/99 of the deputy *Ripa gave *Meana, in name of the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left; -*B4-0160/99 of the deputy *Dell'#Alba, in name of the Group of Coalition Radical *Europeasobre the situation of #crisis in #Venecia.
A situation frankly *grotesca that #can not less that attribute to an interest *fortísimo, and expect that the great coalitions, that have planted the rights of control of the Parliament behind the protection of the Commission, have learnt of the events of the past months and show in the future more loyalty to the Parliament that to his Commissioners.
#If manipulate the types of interest and increase the deficit of the public arks is not painful, reestablish the balance of the social security, reinforce the flexibility of the market of work and reduce the costs *salariales of the less qualified workers are, by the contrary, unpopular measures.
The speaker, when expressing  in name of a commission dominated by the Groups *PSE and *PPE, of course #can not manifest a point of sight different of the of the dominant Groups and report the fact that the socialist politics implanted in 13 of the 15 States members #would plant to *Europa in a competitive situation *desventajosa in the world-wide market.
Already I have had occasion, Mrs. *Metten, to present in detail the recommendation of the Commission in front of his Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and Industrial Politics, and given the little time that  *nos has conceded this afternoon, wanted to, #if *me allow it, concentrate my intervention with the end to answer with rapidity to the questions and comments of his speaker, and to the that have mentioned  this afternoon.
Gentleman President, this Parliament will happen to the history no so much for being the Parliament that motivated the collective resignation of the Commission what for having been the Parliament *causante of the structural changes already in course in the organisation and operation of the Commission, institutional organ by excellence for the impulse of the #european integration.
It is extraordinarily important that #all #that to the that *nos concerns the future of the Union, the correct execution of the community budget and the value of the money of the taxpayers try to use all *eso to reach a deeper reform with clear goals and a big capacity of execution that #can *propiciar the achievement of results.
In the Report *Herman treats  the reform of the institutions that is possible to make without modifying the Treaty, for example, the reduction of the number of wallets in the Commission and the rational occupation of #the same, #as well as a just balance among the collective and individual responsibilities of the members of the Commission.
#If now there #be a problem with an interim Commission that has lost his morals and his political authority to act, the problem has to , in my opinion, to that the Council did not listen to the Parliament and did not appoint an effective interim Commission.
The Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left invites to the future president to pose and develop economic and social politics creators of employment, *le invites to struggle against the social exclusion and the poverty and by the promotion of the public services in the European Union.
It is not sufficient, as *usted has taken, signal the environmental suffering of the #european cities, without facing up to the problem that generates it: the anomalous increase of the private transport, because of the dictated of the incentives in favour of the industry of the car, and the corresponding decrease of the public transport.
Gentleman President, gentleman candidate to the Presidency of the Commission, take part in my condition of Speaker of the Commission of Rights of the Woman of the European Parliament. It #would wish *recordarles the statement of the Parliament with date of 23 March, in the that this institution demanded a considerably greater presence of women in the new Commission.
And it has added that, in consequence, is necessary to establish a base of conditions essential in the field of the environmental politics, of the social politics, of the politics of defence of the consumers and of the guarantee of the competition by means of controls of #the same and of the subventions, so as to that the inner market work like #such for #all *Europa and no only in small plots.
The enlargement of the European Union is, definitely, #one of the fundamental tasks that will have to carry out during his mandate, but also will require a round of contacts institutional -that *yo believe that it #would have to develop  very prompt-directed to create the conditions for the enlargement, by means of a greater application of the procedure of decision by majority, for example.
By #his indication and after declaring that it takes  with immediate character, finish to approve a modification of the article 5 of the Regulation, that says that, regarding the granting and the denial of the approval of the management, #can not present amendments to the proposal of decision relative to the approval of the management.
#One of two: or it takes  like foundation the ethnic rights, but in this case, obviously, each #one has to obtain his part of the cake, and #would take fault an international conference to go back to define the borders, or well, and #this is my position, insists  in the respect of the international borders like a big principle of security in the international relations, but then that it do not divide  said principle.
It has achieved to create dangers and restlessness in #all the region, humiliate to the UN, and of course, wing #european political unit, *algo that definitely found  in the intentions of the #american nationalism, and to it that our #european leaders contribute from his fears and his local ambitions, leaving to a side the possibility of a collective and autonomous path.
In the plane of the stability and the security it is necessary to propose to *Rusia common initiatives in matter of external politics by means of contacts by part of the High Representative for the *PESC, the increase of the #russian participation *cuando the European Union uses the Western European Union for the called operations of Saint *Petersburgo, #as well as the strengthening of the cooperation in matter of control of the disarmament.
I believe that said balance reflects it hit of an axiom: that the external dimension of the Union depends and is very related with his inner strength and, therefore, do not suffices with that *nos *quejemos and *nos regret that we still have not consolidated the external politics and of common security, but that we have to put #all the means to achieve that this external politics and of security -and also of defence- answer to our interests and to our responsibilities.
In the first place, because *lesiona and limits the autonomy of the Parliament, although the Treaty of *Amsterdam *le recognises a paper *prioritario -even in the logic of a correct agreement *interinstitucional in that they take part fully the Commission and the Council- to the hour to establish the Statute of his members and to fix clearly the material conditions of exercise of his work.
For the delegation of the Parliament the approval of this amendment was very important, because for this date the greater part of the citizens of the European Community will receive for the first time the euro like coin and #can expect  that by the transparency of prices will make  more shopping in the inner market above the national borders.
The present managerial of guarantee includes  in the index of the directive on inhibitory actions in matter of protection of the interests of the consumers and to facilitate to the consumers the shopping in the inner market  *les recommends to the producers that sell products in varied States members attach a list with a direction of contact in each country #where commercialises  the product.
Finally, *me #would enjoy to give the thanks to the Mr. *Santer and to the Mr. Ear because after twenty years of work has achieved  that the internal #telephone directory of the Commission distribute  officially accompanied of a letter in the that says  that #all the other will be able to obtain it in the course of a pair of months *cuando the draft have converted  in a true #telephone directory.
They have posed  two fundamental points: the need of a Conference *Intergubernamental in the short term in the year 2000, with a method and a calendar to argue, and the question of the Constitution that have ascertained with #a lot of satisfaction that this morning has gone back to arouse the Mr. *Verheugen.
The #portuguese socialist deputies have voted against of the today approved resolution in the European Parliament, because it prevents the entrance in vigour of the Statute of the Deputies, #such as it was proposed by the Council of Ministers, that represents an important strengthening of the credit of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, *señorías, the reform of the *OMC «meat of *vacuno» represented #one of the delicate files of the new *PAC of the years 2000-2006 had account of the structural disequilibriums of the market of this production, of the consequences of the phenomenon of the «crazy cows» in front of the consumers and also of the place that represents the *ganadería in the occupation of the territory.
First: although I share the opinion that it is necessary to intensify the politics for the development of the rural areas, without embargo, a reduction of the actions for the disadvantaged regions without an increase of the credits, #would mean that we #would have to take these credits of other actions for the development of the rural areas.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the problem of the *comitología poisons literally the relations among the Parliament and the Council, and even more: it takes the times of screen in front of the public opinion, because the complexity of this mechanism of *comitología has reached to take denser the opaque mist of the taking of decisions in front of the citizens.
It treats  of #one *segunda reading and in fact it that have tried is to consider the common position of the Council, *comparándola with the original proposal of the European Commission to the light of the evolution lived through the amendments proposed by this Parliament -although no by me like speaker; *yo the supported later- and afterwards have believed necessary -again in narrow collaboration with the European Commission- present another series of amendments.
Gentleman President, the Commission of Freedoms Public and of Inner Subjects, in #whose name take part here, feared that the Council #would not reach to put of agreement on the relative decisions to the incorporation of the Agreement of *Schengen to the frame of the European Union in the planned term and that this juridical matter #would happen automatically to form part of the *tercer *pilar.
I have incorporated in our amendment the request that the Annex *II vote  as it elaborated  in the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, since in my opinion, our version of the Annex *redunda in benefit of the development of the common market, of the inner market.
To the equal that occurs in the competition, in the States Joined, also here is necessary that it was the State the that no only assume the costs of the fight against the delinquency, but also the that it adopt the decisions around the strict norms and to the necessary technical possibilities to combat with firmness the cases of offence very grave.
Now well, *yo believe that in a moment in that it debates  the right of interference humanitarian, in a moment in that it recognises  that the international order has to have of instruments that allow to defend the fundamental human rights, in those points in that they are flagrant and gravely violated, is definitely paradoxical that there are delays in it that we #can consider a judicial instance of the right of interference, that #would be exactly #this.
It That are debating today here, in the version that has examined the European Parliament, modifies the requirements of 1995 to end to include data on the users of Internet as they are the direction #IP, the electronic direction assigned to a part, the account number and the direction of post electronic (*ENFOPOL 10951/98 *REV2).
A protection, on the other hand, no free but in fulfillment of some disposals, of some requirements established in the norms that govern the World-wide Organisation of the Trade and, on the other hand, in the norms that the own European Union has given  to govern the trade with the third countries, with the countries in roads of development.
It That I want to say today in this partial period of inaugural sessions is that we expect can have the new President of the Commission, with the President in exercise of the #finnish Council and, of course, with the Mrs. *Fontaine, to continue this big work of support to the process of peace and that #this was a priority in the visits of our Speaker to *Irlanda of the North.
The President of the Commission has signalled #some subjects, the health of the citizens, the doping in the sport and the aerial traffic to illustrate symbolically this attitude to the program, although afterwards *me seems precipitated the attention that offers to two points: the subject of the reconstruction of *Kosovo and the Conference *Intergubernamental of *Helsinki.
To the equal that the majority of the States members of the EU, the Commission is likewise of the opinion that the last modifications of the #turkish laws have opened the possibility that the procedure against the Mr. *Öcalan and the pronouncement of the sentence transfer  to a civil Court.
It is our firm purpose treat, from the reports of the Commission, to #all the countries candidates with the greater possible equality and pretend to adopt the pertinent decisions it more aptly possible, so that said countries #can *cerciorarse that they progress in the negotiations in accordance with his own and real capacity, and that the process of adhesion evolves until the end of form just, efficient and answering to beneficial goals for #all.
Gentleman President, the Group *Europa of the Nations considers absolutely unacceptable the attitude of the Commissioner *Bangemann, commissioned of the telecommunications in the previous Commission -or in the current: no longer we know exactly it that we have to say-, that finishes to accept a place very well *remunerado in the council of administration of a society that corresponded before to the sector of his competition.
I conclude saying that the Mrs. *Laguiller took a very valuable contribution to this debate because, to the equal that #others, *dramatizó the subject perfectly attracting the attention to the economic lagoons of the society and the form in that said divisions in fact serve to insist in that it is absolutely essential that the that have the big luck to occupy elective public charges and by nomination act with absolute honesty and discretion.
*Me #Would enjoy *pedirle to the Commissioner that elaborate a politics that do not centre  so much in putting a fine to an organisation that has *quebrantado #one or another law, but that elaborate a politics to control to the great organisations, to take that a World-wide or European Championship #can be a party for the citizens in general and no a commercial party.
But yes it is the first time that the legal authority of the competition has put end to this fraud, has put end to the discriminatory sale, and is the first time that an authority of the competition all over the world averts that in the future apply  discriminatory methods in the sale of entrances.
Lady Speaker, believe that it is timely that, of #the same form that have saved a minute of silence by the victims of the earthquakes in #Grecia and *Turquía -and with more reason because, with independence of the quantity of dead persons, has a very deep political meaning-, #would have to save, in this moment, a minute of silence by the victims of the #indonesian repression in *Timor Oriental.
Of #the same mood guarantee that the complete review of the financial management of the Commission and the systems of control will be intensified, taking into account fully the specific recommendations made by the Committee on #all the questions including those posed by the that they have referred  in the debate to the subsidies and the rest of subjects.
*Cuando In the Report of the Experts, that do not distinguishes on purpose among political and administrative responsibility, demands , among other things, that the President of the Commission has to possess the faculty to resign to individual members of the Commission this demand do not agrees, in my opinion, with the *gentlemens' *agreement among the President *Prodi and the Commissioners that have been designated.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the Report (To5-002/99) of the Mrs. #Jackson in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer on the proposal of recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council (*COM(1988)0772 - *C4-0073/1999 - 1998/0358 (*COD) (before 1998/0358(*SYN)) on minimum criteria of the environmental inspections in the States members.
The reform of the common politics of fishing, foreseen for the year 2002, will be a big challenge and a big proof that will have to confront this new Commission. Because the sector *pesquero expects of this reform that the politics *pesquera convert  in an authentic common politics #european and that the Commission the dowry of the value added community necessary.
Of #the same way that, with #all reason, has delayed this morning the vote in the measure in that it did not have  of the Record on the that it had to pronounce the Assembly, is very evident that will not be able to take it more that on the disposal that appears in the Record, that is a disposal of order general and no on the particular conclusions that give off of *ello.
In our political assessment *reviste big importance the program of the Commission that wants to value the conquests of the past and deepen the commitment in favour of the peace and the security, of the stability and the employment, of the welfare of #all the Europeans, #as well as of the other countries that are wall of *nosotros, in the east and the south.
I regret to say that the Mr. *Busquin did not satisfy to the majority of the colleagues of the commission neither with his answers on his participation in ancient financial scandals neither with his answers on his competition for the wallet neither on #if had the sense of responsibility and of suitable leadership to face up to the tasks that await to this Commission.
My Group receives with clear satisfaction in this context the statement of the Mr. *Fischler in favour that the fundamental juridical acts relative to the general conception of the orientation of the agricultural politics transact  by the procedure of *codecisión and his will to defend actively this position in the future Conference *Intergubernamental.
Lady Speaker, in spite of the brilliant intervention of the Speaker of the Council, Minister *Halonen, have to call the attention on the secret that has surrounded the preparatory works of the meeting of *Tampere, thing that *ocasionó an incident *grotesco the past week after the publication by the #danish diary *Berlingske *Tidenden of an article, in the that it said  that it #would try  reduce the immigration from third countries, even through campaigns of *atemorización and threats.
His statements, #as well as the interventions of our colleagues, situate  by it that to the collaboration among the European Parliament, the national Parliaments and the Council and the Commission refers , in a juridical field that houses an enormous danger. In concrete *me refer to the risk that the legislation finish moving away of the #european citizens.
To finalise, the idea of #one *Europa that was not only market and only coin is very beautiful, especially of #one *Europa that it was a space of freedom, security and justice, but is important that this challenge win  really so much to *través of the progressive strengthening of the community Institutions as boosting the collaboration and the cooperation among the States members, more that resorting to decisions by qualified majority that did not represents of by himself/hisself the solution to the problems.
Lady Speaker, *señorías, when taking the word in our Parliament #few hours after the terrible accident, #can not leave to express publicly it very affected that it finds  the #greek representation and it a lot that regrets the tragic loss in fulfillment of the have to of the *Viceministro of External Subjects of #Grecia, *Yannos *Kranidiotis, a big politician with #european vision that has loaned great services especially to the cause of the peace and the cooperation in the *Balcanes, to the reconciliation among #Grecia and *Turquía.
Also I want to appreciate the work of the Minister of Subjects External of *Irlanda, Mr. *Andrews, like representative of the Speaker of the Council in the inspection of the headcount of votes in *Timor Oriental, #as well as the of the Minister of Subjects External of Big *Bretaña, Mr. *Cook, that represented to the Speaker of the Council in the meeting of the *APEC.
#If the fine public management is a fundamental previous requirement to loan help for the development, why the fine public management did not has to be also a fundamental criterion for the international recognition, the bilateral relations and the development of the trade?
I think likewise that it also is important and it is necessary *recalcar the fact that today we owe *plantearnos the question of the reconstruction of a social tissue, economic and morals in a context in that surely a wider vision of *Europa *suroriental #can not constitute an element of division with regard to the elections of the Agency with headquarters in a place instead of #another.
The Commission has made efforts to improve and take clearer the Agreement that today has in front of himself/hisself the Assembly for his consideration with seen to take his more transparent application and also to take into account the pertinent disposals approved in the global agreement among the European Community and Nations Joined.
Instead, the members of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations have voted in favour of the group of the other amendments, including the amendment 22, that limits the right of initiative of the Commission and that allows to the committee *ad *hoc establish his agenda, his records, #as well as the statements of interest of his own members.
Definitely the report of the gentleman Commissioner *Kinnock has been exhaustive and important, nevertheless is necessary to consider especially the political side of it that becomes in *Rusia in this moment, is to say, that #all #this will be able to *desestabilizar the international politics in the next period, #as well as the commercial relations of the Community with the own *Rusia, without thinking in the grave consequences that suffers the *empresariado community that has invested in this country.
I think that the Commission is very situated to take part to this level, and had explains that the question of the #kosovar prisoners situates  in the humanitarian plane, the European Union #can show *renuente in the sending of the help to the #serbian authorities, while #this do not leave in freedom to #all the #kosovar prisoners.
In the Conference of Presidents, is to say, to the Presidents of Group, *les have said, with the backrest of a big majority, that in this moment do not wish a resolution on the *OMC, because even *subsiste the need of debate, and now #would not have to  elaborate a resolution in the procedure of urgency, because with *ello #one go  to take wanted to here and there.
Fifteen days ago, the recent veterinary committee permanent of the Union took the decision to raise the embargo that weighed on the exports of *vacuno #belgian. It has recognised in this way the seriousness of the proofs and the severity of the norms that, in the actuality, imposes the #belgian Government.
Gentleman *Prodi, *nos upsets especially the fact that, these last years vital subjects for the human existence, related with the quality and the security of the foods #as well as with the protection of the health of the #european citizens, jump continuously to the *primer flat of the actuality through processes and mechanisms that do not guarantee always the validity and the credibility of the information.
The European Parliament has underlined with frequency the importance of the adoption of measures in matter of energetic efficiency and the Council has underlined also the need of the saving of energy and a reduction of the broadcasts of CO2 in a series of resolutions.
As up to now the Community has not been able to put of agreement on #which is the most effective instrument for the reduction of the gases *termoactivos -to know, the taxation of the consumption of energy-, the Commission and the Council consider the program *SAVE *II a "important and necessary instrument".
I expect, therefore, that the companies of the sector of the energy of the States members of the EU that have a wide experience in projects related with the energetic efficiency #can transmit his knowledges to these countries. Lady Commissioner, entrust in that said companies are considered like real candidates to the hour to award the agreements and do not see  displaced by the North American companies.
Gentleman President, independently of the *calificativos that they #can use in #one or another language, is true that the negotiations on this Agreement of Trade have lengthened  of an inconceivable form. As it remained of self-evident in #all a series of resolutions approved by this House, went a really shameful show, especially #if it takes into account that *Sudáfrica finished to make a very brave transition to a free and democratic Government.
I want to appreciate to the Parliament and, in particular, to the speaker of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, Mrs. *Kinnock, the form, fast and flawless, as it has taken the preparatory work for the approval of the *dictamen satisfied of the Parliament on the result of our negotiations with the #south african and by the form, very active and *comprometidísima, as it has contributed to this process along the years.
Regarding the European Union, asked  the intervention of the Office of Fight against the Fraud, the *OLAF, so that it invited to the #spanish judicial authorities to investigate #if the management and the control of the community subventions to the crop of the linen have been correct and #if there #be had performances that #can consider criminal.
I am new in this Assembly and wail that the first question #whose answer went to listen in this Assembly #can not be answered *oralmente by reasons of time, but wail doubly that *ello have to , precisely, to the attitude of #some that, when arousing in this Assembly question that, in my opinion, are not for this Assembly, *nos deprive of the pleasure to listen to the Mr. *Fischler talk today of the problem of the bread of our fishermen, for example.
Thus I request, lady Speaker, that write a letter in name of the European Parliament to the #british Prime minister for *expresarle #ours weigh and our horror by the magnitude of this terrible disaster, and *pedirle that transmit #ours deeper condolence to the families of the persons that have lost the life, #as well as to the familiar of the that have resulted gravely injured together with the wish of a total recovery.
Gentleman Commissioner, the ball is in the field of *Turquía and is of here of #where has to come the following movement, because by part of *Europa already have had *bastantes things to encourage  and do not see, by part of *Turquía, in the official field and no by part of the #turkish village, that also is bearing the diet that *le has been imposed, the answer that need to give *nosotros the following step.
Like this, in our opinion, shows  once again, that the hypocrisy, in #all his greatness, is #one of the basic principles of the European Union. The politics of the two weights and the two measures, the politics of the selective sensitivity in front of the human rights and in front of the respect of the international Right.
The politics of the two weights and the two measures, that bases  in the political and economic interests of the powers that govern in the European Union, *les takes to close the eyes in front of it that is *sucediendo in the actuality in *Turquía. #This denies  to the democratisation, to the respect to the human rights, violates #all the principles of the international Right.
Nevertheless, I create important, by a part, make immediately a study in depth, with the end to determine it more exactly possible the effects, in his case, of this agreement in the economy of The Meeting and, on the other hand, establish a permanent mechanism of able control to create the conditions for a fast intervention.
But #if here our paper consists in reflecting the worries, the *interrogantes and the expectations of our *conciudadanos #european, conserve in our mind the world-wide dimension of the challenges, the challenges of the countries in development that today debate  among the hope of the integration in the world-wide economy and the fear to the marginalisation.
In this field, said countries confront  to a double difficulty: his internal markets are generally hoarded by monopolies or oligopolies, #whose *primer effect is the to take *repercutir in the local consumers, and mainly in the poorest, some too much high prices, whereas the second effect is the to block the arrival of new countries and of *obligarlos to confine  in the informal economy.
Since the Mr. *Sasi has had the friendliness to accept the invitation to the meeting of the Commission of Industry, External Market, Investigation and Energy of the European Parliament of 12 October, suggest that it present his official answer to these two points in the frame of the meeting.
I do not go to follow making assessments here to the *respecto, but believe that the reduction of the CO2 is not an optional charge but that has also an economic effect and offers the opportunity to paginate the improvement of the quality of life with the employment, by it that think that it do not has to  defend the negotiate on some boundless broadcasts.
Therefore, *le offer another opportunity to answer: it thinks the Council order an audit of the States members to determine how States have a discriminatory legislation against lesbians and *gays, that do not guarantee the equality of rights, the equality of rights civil to lesbians and *gays and that do not offer #the same protection in virtue of the law to lesbians and to *gays?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, will not have need of three minutes for *expresarles the fundamental importance of the subject of the resolution that subjects  to our approval, relative to the code in matter of export of arms, for the extension of a zone of peace and of stability in the world, it that certainly constitutes #one of the most important mandates that have received of our constituents.
(*FR) The fact to reduce drastically the broadcasts of gases that cause the effect *invernadero by part of the rich countries is a duty of solidarity in front of the future generations, but also in front of the populations of the countries in roads of development, that will suffer every time with greater hardness the natural catastrophes caused by the climatic change.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0036/1999) of the Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the agreement *interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the Office of Fight against the Fraud.
It is necessary, without embargo, underline once again the sensitivity that distinguishes to the House, the sensitivity that distinguishes to the European Parliament in the subject of the fraud, a sensitivity materialised in the internal decision of the European Parliament, and a sensitivity that besides renews ,  *reformula in the report and in the proposal of the Mr. *Napolitano.
It has posed  a question to #that *respecto but believe that the resolved satisfactorily in the parliamentary commission with the amendment of transaction presented by the Mr. #Gil-Oaks and by me, in the that specifies  that the application of this agreement *interinstitucional do not lessens any legislative disposal neither of our Regulation regarding the obligation to respect the confidentiality concerning the deputies.
To judge by the analysis that has taken the Mr. *Ferri is evident that are talking of legislation in matter of vehicles of engine no only in the #european plane but in the plane of the Economic Commission for *Europa of the Nations Joined, that during #a lot of years has been recognised by the car industry like entity that establishes #all a range of norms world-wide.
#This is the reason by the that proposed, with the support of the Commission of Budgets, group #all the politics and the relative budgetary lines to the creation of this space of freedom, of security and of justice under an only title, with five chapters that correspond to the great political directed to the realisation of the space of freedom, of security and of justice.
The reason advanced to try justify these dark cuts is the unforeseen apparition of new priorities totally legitimate in principle, like the help to the reconstruction of *Kosovo, the contribution to the *edificación of *Timor oriental at last released, the solidarity with the victims of the earthquake of *Turquía and the finance of an agreement of fishing with *Marruecos.
The Mr. *Bourlanges has confronted  to a double paradox: the of a debate on the budget that occupies  of costs but no of entrances and the of a budget subjected to the double and *contrapuesta pressure of the increase of the tasks of the European Union and of the objective decrease *tendencial of the percentage of the #european #GDP that *transita to *través of the budget of the Union.
It has said  here that the goal *prioritario is the inflation, but is not the only: we have to talk, among other things, of an economic pole, of the responsibility, of the international representation of the euro and of the supervision of the banking institutions in a moment of great fusions among the financial institutions.
This principle involves that we have to confront together the grave world-wide problem of the drugs, in each #one of the links of the chain, is to say, the production, the distribution, the consumption, the wash of money, the deviation of the chemical precursors and the sale of arms.
The Bosses of State or of Government recognised, like this, the obligation to respect the solemn commitment that assumed in *Tampere. The Commission, basing in the dialogue and the cooperation with the European Parliament, is had to take all it possible to reach that it was a reality a Space of Freedom, Security and Justice, above #everything, balanced in his three components: freedom, security and justice.
The Parliament wished, of course, that in this Summit reached  #european commitments more ambitious, but, frankly, is very positive that these important questions appear now in the #european diary with a frame, with a clear order for the European Commission and also, therefore, with a mission for the European Parliament, by it that I want to congratulate to the Presidency and, especially, to the Commission.
Finally, in the moment in that it finishes to be born a committee of company "*Michelin", has to modify  the community legislation so that the employees or his representatives, affected by plans of collective dismissal by economic reasons, #can promote judicial actions without expecting to that pronounce  on the dismissal the competent territorial jurisdiction and impugn the foundation of this decision.
I consider that in this level, by means of the general frame of the lines economic guidelines, or of the lines guidelines for the employment, have #a lot of things that learn; no only in the national field, but also, #if *ustedes prefer, #can have a *benhmarking, an exchange of informations and of models applied with hit to national level to solve this terrible problem of the restructurings that, of course, will have it in front of *nosotros in #all the sectors.
They are based in an entirely realistic assessment, according to the *cual *Europa, that is a place with strong social powers, *cuando there #be not social cohesion will suffer social conflicts, and the social conflicts will have immediate consequences in the economic stability, is to say, in the indispensable surroundings for the development of the competition and of the companies.
A look by the that seat special interest is the negotiation with hit of the program *multilateral of environment and nuclear security. It tries  guarantee that western donors provide technical assistance and financial help for the storage and the elimination of waste nuclear in the Northwest of *Rusia, #all these terrible nuclear submarines that  *oxidan, #as well as the rest of waste nuclear.
To finish, wanted to underline that in a society oriented to the telematic networks and Internet and that invests increasingly in his utilisation for the communication, the information and the services, is quite ridiculous that the Council have not accepted the amendments in *pro of the creation of a spot Internet totally devoted to the youngsters.
It treated  to know #if it created  a line by key action, as it had established the Commission of Budgets, or #if it kept  a global line for the investigation, as it wished the executive Commission, to change that they gave  guarantees regarding the information on the movement of bottoms among the key actions inside this line.
#If the #ours is the Institution that, with #all security, has made the greater efforts in the fight against the fraud in the Institutions of the European Community, how go to understand the citizens that the only persons to the that do not affects the *OLAF to effects of internal investigations are the deputies of the European Parliament?
How device has foreseen , gentleman Commissioner, in case that there #be a blockade of the situation, so that the directly affected fuselages, so that #all #that that take part in the sector *pesquero, so that the regions involved and, in particular, the zones of the goals 1 and 2, that depend of the fishing, as it expresses our common resolution, do not accuse of front the catastrophic consequences that tended the no renewal of the agreement?
The sector *pesquero that affects to the Realm of *Marruecos is formed by small employers, by *armadores to the *cuales *les results absolutely impossible to create mixed companies of #moroccan majority and, therefore, the type of agreement new has to be an agreement *continuador, modifying the necessary clauses, of the agreement in this existent moment, taking into account that -how no- *nosotros respect that this agreement benefit to the economic and social development of *Marruecos.
And I take it by economic reasons, that already have explained varied of the orators that have taken part in this Assembly, but also, to similarity of it that *sucedió yesterday in the debate on the Agreement of Fishing among the European Union and *Marruecos, by reasons of help to a country that, in spite of being rich in natural resources, is poor by fault of the political situation in that it finds  and, in particular, of the climate of war.
In spite of an absolutely essential rejection the past month of June, without going more far, in the elections to the European Parliament of the *lejanía and of the *secretismo of our institutions collectively, this first meeting of the next week will increase the democratic deficit, in the sense that the Parliament will remain excluded and do not seems to have a valid reason for *ello.
In this case have added an additional disposal in the that will ask  a review to the cape of five years in the that they take part the two parts of the industry in the #european level to see how works the diet in this sector, with particular reference to the health and the security of the workers interested.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the oral question (*B5-0032/1999) of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council titled "Strategy for the realisation of the only market European" .
According to my experience, #this also affects in particular precisely to the relative subjects to the legislation in matter of protection of the consumer, in the that with big frequency there #be had contradictions among the different managerial and among the different norms of #european field, for example in the determination of the terms of complaint or the terms of protection of the consumer, that often have varied.
First: how we go to convert in effective the only market #if the States tend to adopt protectionist measures - have seen #some cases, even lately - and how pretends the Commission use better the procedure of infringement converting it in faster and encouraging to the citizens and his associations to report the rapes of the community Right that register  daily in the distinct States members?
The plans of the Commission to take a more strict follow-up of the efforts and the results obtained in the field of the national politics are *bienintencionados, but *me fear that *surtirán the contrary effect. Especially #if it opts  by a quantitative method that consists in adding the number of measures, instruments of support and projects of creation of employment.
But there #be more: it #can not treat only of moderation *salarial and of flexibility like #such, because #this *desvirtuaría the character and the spirit of the national dialogues, the maintenance of the social protection and #all the instruments of programming negotiated in the territory, sensitive no only to the small and medium enterprise, but also to these sectors more *congeniales to the tradition and to the characteristics of the territory.
Likewise, the document not even mentions the paper of an active politics of credits to support to the company - in this sense, the system *crediticio European follows being to years light of the American - and believe that the efforts of the European Union and of the States members for *darle a distinct orientation have been to date very scarce.
And, although it is *algo that do not says  in high voice, this problem is linked to the own luck of our democracies, as, as the history *nos teaches, the democracies do not base  so only in the production of wealth, but that his health depends also of a wide distribution that has to reach to the big majority of the population, and #this is thing that in the contemporary societies involves to guarantee the employment.
Report (To5-0048/1999) of the Mrs. *Quisthoudt-*Rowohl, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the conclusion of the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Russian Federation (*COM(1999) 324 - *C5-0083/1999 - 1999/0133(*CNS))
Report (To5-0045/1999) of the Mr. *Menrad, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that creates  the Committee of Employment (*COM(1999) 440 - *C5-0173/1999 - 1999/0192(*CNS)) and on the proposal of the Commission of guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000 (*COM(1999) 441 - *C5-0147/1999 - 1999/0816(*CNS))
An important reason is, to my mood to see, that to the Europeans, in contrast with the Americans in general *nos is missing the attitude of risk and fault also a positive motivation in the population that contribute to that through a good economic growth reach also a positive politics of employment in *Europa and in the national states.
We need laws simpler and, especially, do not have to commit an error -even in this Assembly- to create so much in the national plane as by means of #european norms, by means of regulations or by means of directives, #one *superreglamentación that treat to the population like a herd and, consistently, #this shop in definite to not running risks, to not to take independent, to not undertaking active occupations, but to act rather in a field ensured, which at the end *nos goes to conduct to a new vertiginous increase...
The directive on the improvement of the quality of the fuels #as well as the technician, already existent, of the catalysts allow in this point to the Council and to the Parliament an absolutely ambitious project, without overloading with taxes to the industry and to the sector of the transport.
The program *Daphne 2000-2003 goes to be an extremely important instrument in the fight against the violence and will procure a value added to the local actions, regional and national in this field by means of the creation of networks, the exchange of information, better practical and cooperation, and a greater awareness of the society in general.
In #day of the new #millenium, gentleman President, #can say that a support *vigoroso of the European Parliament to this program will be the best and clearer of the signs that the Union awards the maximum political priority to the effective fight against the violence that suffer the boys, the teenagers and the women.
Gentleman President, this year fulfils  the *décimo anniversary of the Convention of the Nations Joined and is an opportunity *inmejorable for the European Parliament and for the Commission, no simply to pronounce #some solemn speeches on this anniversary, but mainly for *decidirnos to act more, to facilitate but resources and to take initiatives and measures that constitute a politics integrated and *conectiva that protect with efficiency the human values and the dignity of the boys.
It is, clearly, the base of a healthy budgetary administration. Without embargo have to underline that the budgetary discipline do not has to constitute an end in #if same and do not has to cancel the correct and effective application of the essential disposals of the community legislation, neither neither in this case, touch the basic principles of the *PAC.
To5-0057/1999 of the Mr. *Gebhardt, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, on the proposal of regulation (*CE) of the relative Council to the competition, the recognition and the execution of resolutions judicial in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children [*COM(99) 220  *C­0045/1999  1999/0110(*CNS)].
The goal of the regulation is to guarantee that the resolutions on the divorce and other forms of separation that have produced  in the States members are recognised with rapidity by the other States members and besides provide some suitable rules to the times and unitary in it *tocante to the parental responsibility by the common children of the spouses.
In reality, #would have to work in favour of a global agreement in this field, without embargo, with this initiative step in this path, as it do not fits doubt of the big importance -a point in the that have been in general #all the orators of agreement- that we recognise the resolutions of the other in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility, especially in a period like the that live now, in the that the familiar structure is suffering violent transformations.
Before the presentation of a proposal of action concrete to #that *respecto, the Commission asked, basing in the quoted communication, to the States members, in the level of the Council, and to the European Parliament that communicated his observations on the points tackled in the communication on the protection of the victims of the delinquency.
I am safe that the Commission goes to guarantee the coherence of the external politics and of the inner politics of the Union -of the programs *transfronterizos and of the programs of help to the development- and that it also is of the interest of the States *beneficiarios of the cooperation *transfronteriza -*Marruecos and *España- that advance proposed that they correspond to #the same worry.
*Yo Believe that #if we fulfil with our committed in our quality of Europeans, will contribute to strengthen the group of the Alliance of the Atlantic North and #if from here assume these tasks, #such as they finish to manifest the Gentlemen #Solana and *Patten, and *usted, gentleman #Solana, also engages  to have a conversation with *nosotros, as already it takes it the Commission, always that we consider it necessary, #can have the security that my Group will be to his side.
. (OF) Gentleman President, Gentleman Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, the report of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy on the approach of the EU on the Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC links with the works made by the previous Commission of External Economic Relations, that adopted in #all the cases by a big majority his position regarding the rounds of negotiations of *Marrakech, *Singapur and Gin.
Nevertheless, the news that the agents negotiators of the European Commission informed hardly a week before the agreement of the States Joined that dismissed the possibility of the #chinese adhesion in a next future *nos carries to think that the European Union has not negotiated with the conviction that #would fit to expect.
Report (To5-0057/1999) of the Mrs. *Gebhardt, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the proposal of regulation of the Council (*COM(1999) 220 - *C5-0045/1999 - 1999/0110(*CNS)) relative to the competition, the recognition and the execution of resolutions judicial in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children
This Parliament, that has had an important paper in this process, in addition to cheering  by the development of the events in *Irlanda of the North, #would have to involve in the effort so that the #others two violent conflicts that *subsisten in the breast of the Union -the of *Córcega and, especially, the of the Basque Country- walk by the *senda of the definite peace.
Gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President of the Council, no only want to direct the attention to the environmental damages caused in *Europa by pertinent products of other countries, but that also loan  greater attention to the methods of treatment and production employed in other countries and that no only debate  the subject of the identification, but also the possibility to adopt commercial measures that allow to avert environmental damages all over the world.
Said decision no only condemns to the inhabitants of *Yugoslavia to happen the winter *carentes completely of the necessary means of heating, after the enormous *destrozos caused in the public infrastructure by the bombardments of the NATO, but that affects of mood *provocador to the pride of #all a village, that results victim of the blackmail and the annihilation because Occident do not approves to his political leader.
Imagine that they #can open investigations to deputies in virtue of grave facts tied to the exert of his functions a juridical concept created #ex *novo, indeterminate and contrary to the constitutional tradition of the fifteen States members, that #can open investigations #if the deputies break analogous obligations to the derivative of the disciplinary Right of the civil servants, a disciplinary Right of the civil servants of the that *carecemos, some similar obligations that do not exist!
Like this, we take a call to the States members, to the institutions of the European Union and to #all the international community so that they keep in the agenda #all the support to the village of *Timor Oriental, initiate the steps for the international recognition of the State of *Timor Oriental and the establishment of the diplomatic relations with *él.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the one who at the beginning of this year #can not more with the murders, the expulsions, the *saqueos and the pillages that the army and the #serbian militia carried out in *Kosovo and in virtue of these reasons pronounced  in favour of a called humanitarian intervention, has to ask now #if the war -that alas did not go directed against the that committed the crimes but against the #yugoslav population-, the war that lasted more of two months and half and that cost varied thousands of millions of euros, really gave the result that expected.
In my opinion, the letter of rights fundamental requires a debate in depth. I create, besides, that the right of the boys #can not *desvincularse of the right of the parents, of the rights of the family and of the right of education of the parents in the family.
The politics of fight against the drug - *me direct to the Commissioner of Security Inner - means, as, by the side of the reduction of the offer also a consistent persecution of the suppliers of drugs, especially in the sector of the bleaching of money.
To #the same time, are different the relations that have to board among the Union in his group and the action of each #one of the States members, among the principle of subsidiariness and the need, that nevertheless has  precisely affirmed, that the Union endow  of a common politics with regard to this phenomenon that concerns for real our present, but especially our future.
It is a system of register and a system of comparison, an instrument, in definite, that *nos helps in the fight against the illegal immigration and #all type of entrance illegal in the country, #as well as also against the commission of acts criminal low false identity.
Have the obligation to remember that this constant current of illegal immigration represents an enormous charge, in particular in the cities of the interior, for our national services of health, our social services and our system of security social, in addition to exerting strong pressure on the limited number of available houses.
In any case, *nos seems fundamental that the next review of the Treaty consecrate the European Bank of Investments like a fully community institution, subject to the supervision of the Court of Accounts and of the European Parliament and that do not answer only in front of a general assembly of the States members, as at present it pretends.
We have taken an analysis in depth, with #all detail, and, in accordance with the available information, on the base of the suppositions of utilisation maximum there #be a remainder still in the year 1999 of 33 millions of euros, of 8,7 in the 2000, of 7 millions -roughly- in the 2001 and, although it is true that in the year 2002 the situation will be absolutely adjusted, go back to exist remanent in the 2003.
To my mood to see, #if all it that *usted has exposed, #everything it that has  to present in the Council of *Helsinki, has truly sense, the unavoidable conclusion is that the European Union #can not  occupy only of sentences like the of the case *Bosman or of the looks of the competition in the field of the sport, but that it has to give value to the sport quoting it sure enough in the Treaty.
In the subject of the Conference *Intergubernamental, believe that after the turn of the Prime minister of his country, lady Speaker, do not fits a so optimistic situation; it #would be a pity lose this opportunity to give an impulse to the project of integration #european and *nos *arrepentiremos of not taking advantage of as it is owed this occasion.
#Many of his *Señorías have mentioned it, have posed it in reiterated occasions to the Parliament and repeat it today: I believe that, in parallel to the culmination of the enlargement -that is an irrefutable reality, since the enlargement that will decide, expect, in *Helsinki is an enlargement that do not poses doubts neither problems neither vacillations- will have to open a debate on the nature and the characteristics of *Europa, since we will be *nosotros the that will establish these limits, the that will decide the nature of *Europa: we #can not simply answer to the, of by himself/hisself legitimate, appeal of the countries that ask to go in in *Europa.
The *tercer change that it wanted to signal is that the #turkish Minister of European Integration and Human Rights -that has a very curious combination of competitions, that without embargo marry well- finishes to declare officially, after the ratification of the conviction of death by the Court of Appeal, that the execution of this conviction #would not favour the interests of *Turquía.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0076/1999) of the Mrs. Towers Mark, in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary, on the report of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1999)174 - *C5-0108/1999) 1999/2111(*COS)) on the length of the transitory period for the introduction of the euro.
Still it is a lot, in view of that the prices of the herring in the Community in this moment are lower that never, owing to the saturation of the market of the EU with cheap fish and herring frozen of Norwegian, and of the establishment, by part of the #german companies, of units of production of low cost in *Polonia, to process the free #norwegian fish of taxes for his export to *Alemania.
Regarding the enlargement of the negotiation to #all the speakers, included the countries in roads of development, the European Union adopted also the initiative to initiate the conference with the *ofrecimiento to guarantee to the less advanced countries a wide access with invalid rights to the markets of the countries industrialised.
Like the liberal politician that am, maybe a #european politician very liberal, wanted to say that in the breast of the EU #would have to think in the form to modify the units of production agricultural and the future of the Diary 2000, in addition to studying how delete the subventions that affect to the trade.
In 1995, indirectly, through an amendment that presented accepted  the training of adults in the program #Socrates *I. From here also it has developed  along the year in #all *Europa the wish by the training of adults and by the continuous learning so that *nos is possible to say that the answer *sustentada by the branch *Gruntvig of the program #Socrates is the correct answer.
In terms of the capacity of the program to be the tip of spear of the values of the Parliament, the hit has been enormous. It is fundamental for the expansion of the educational capacity of our youngsters, no only in terms of his cultural capacity, but also in terms of his economic base.
The European Union always has been pioneering in the cessation of the production and of the employment of substances harmful for the coat of ozone and the Parliament has been the environmental political consciousness of this European Union.
Gentleman President, in the first place wanted to say it a lot that admire the work that the speaker has made in this report; already it was quite difficult that surpassed the first reading in the Parliament and has been even more difficult in the *segunda reading, because there #be had #a lot of points of sight divergent, contradictory scientific opinions and pressures from the distinct groups of interest of the sector with regard to determined substances.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the conjoint debate on the meeting of the European Council of the days 10 and 11 December in *Helsinki and the statement of the Presidency in exercise of the Council on the semester of activity of the #finnish Presidency, #as well as on the situation in *Chechenia and on the Summit of the *OSCE.
In the course of the treatment of the budgets has incorporated  a new game of costs that includes, first, 500 millions of euros for *Kosovo proposed by the summit of the European Union and, afterwards, 190 millions of euros in concept of the Agreement of Fishing with *Marruecos, *Turquía and other complementary subjects, it that represents in total 700 millions of euros, or was, the 15 percent of the financial forecasts of the section.
So as to reduce the estimate of the corresponding costs to the enlargement -the financial frame of *Berlín includes, in effect, the costs from the year 2000-,go to propose likewise to the Commission that make  a permanent evaluation of the economic situation and of the necessary costs for the enlargement that of #this give off.
Therefore, from the point of sight financial, the new period of programming 2000-2006 will be able to initiate  and like this will take , in effect, with a new program, in the that it has taken  state on purpose that the helps with charge to the structural Bottoms have to contribute to boost likewise the equality of opportunities among men and women, the goal of protection of the environment and the employment.
In narrow articulation with this communication, the Commission has approved also #another, accompanied of a proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council and of a proposal of decision of the Council, relative to a program of support to the #european audiovisual industry, the program MEDIATES PLUS 2001-2005.
It treats  to prepare to *Europa so much in the plane of the infrastructures as in the of the industry of the production of programs, for the imperative of the digital era, it that means, of course, accept that *Europa has an ambition in matter of participation in the new digital economy and in the new society of the culture, the to scale world-wide information.
Therefore, it is better that, in place of *fijarnos a more ambitious program that probably #would pose difficulties in matter of subsidiariness and maybe had the effect to reduce the general enthusiasm, follow applying a strategy directed to encourage to the States members so that they take advantage of to the maximum the opportunity to learn -and apply- the initiatives adopted in the #european countries in general.
In 1996 an evaluation of the repercussions of the two programs of positive action with seen to the achievement of the equality of opportunities in the Commission revealed that there had been important changes in the situation of the feminine personnel in the Category To and in the places of direction, in particular to consequence of the dip annual adopted by the Commission.
Like this, apart from the protection to the scientific specialists that have the technical knowledges and do not have to be carried by tortuous paths owing to his knowledges or of his economic weakness; I believe that, go in in a logic of conditions political on it that happens or leaves to happen in his regions, is a condition *sine *qua *non for the countries candidates to the adhesion.
Subject: Venues of game The Court of Justice has recognised that, in the field of application of the Treaty *CE, the organisation of games of chance constitutes an economic activity of provision of services, #if well with the precision that the disposals of the States members to authorise the opening of venues of game have to be provided and no discriminatory (Subject *Schindler *C-275/92).
The harmonisation in the sphere of the application of the national penal right and of the administration of the justice in the States members presupposes, necessarily, the harmonisation of the legislation on the fight against the fraud and #any one other illegal activities in the community budget.
Memory that, after that revolution, like minister of External Subjects, *me gathered in the Nations Joined with the minister of Subjects External of Chinese and the worry of the #chinese minister of External Subjects of then was the to say "for *nosotros, *Macao is not a colony; therefore, *ustedes, that are taking the decolonisation, do not touch *Macao; in his moment, already  *regularizará" .
Gentleman President, my answer goes  to develop around two axes: the first refers  to it *sucedido until today from the Conference of *Beijing and to how the European Union has supported the actions contemplated in the common platform then adopted; and the second, to the paper of Parliament by it that *atañe to the meeting of Nations Joined foreseen for the summer of the 2000.
Far to hail this effort in favour of the protection of the environment, the European Union only has a goal in the bilateral negotiations with Swiss: force to that this country renounce to his regulation, with the pretext that it hinders the free competition and that it boosts the inequality of deal among #european territories.
It #would not have won  time, by the contrary, beginning by the principle, being more modest and loaning greater attention to the opinions of the citizens and of the villages that are not very convinced of the balance of #this *OMC, of the results of his realisations regarding the *agravación of the inequalities of development among the North and the South?
These twelve partial fields of interest will be examined in the following groups under the titles *mainstreaming generals: the gender in the politics of the development, is to say as it takes part the equality among the sexes in #all collaboration of the European Union with the countries in development, the participation of the women and the human rights.
#If it fits still add *algo to the previous answers, #can signal that #one of the causes of the delays of the flights is that, in the current system, the planes do not obtain the permission of takeoff until it have not confirmed  the green light of landing in the airport of destination.
The States members of the EU have engaged  to adopt an effective politics of no proliferation of armament and to take part in the systems of control of export, or was, in the actions that carry out in the frame of the Committee of the group *Zanger of exporters of the nuclear sector, of the group *Australia and of the mechanisms *Wassenaar.
In conclusion, expect that the Council manifest #the same firmness that the European Parliament for *salvaguardar and promote the system of the only price of the book, that, as it signals our resolution, treats  of the best system to improve the production and the distribution of dramas literary, without deleting the competition.
Gentleman President, *me take echo of the opinions of the two previous orators when giving the sincerest welcome to this proposal of resolution to condemn unambiguously the *tremendo #record of rapes of the human rights of the #taliban diet Afghan, and in particular the persecution of the #afghan women in the name of the religion and of the culture.
Nevertheless, the appeals of help to the agriculturalists in the form of help in front of natural disasters #can examine in the frame of the article 33 of the Regulation (*CE) *nº 1257/99, of the Council, of 17 May 1999, on the help to the rural development to charge of the European Bottom of Orientation and of Agricultural Guarantee.
Without embargo, have to signal that the procedure is not ideal, the Mrs. *Doyle and the other deputies have reason, but the problem to the that *nos confront in the Commission of Politics Regional, Transports and Tourism that is the competent commission, is that the Council *nos asks urgency in the last minute because, somewhere, somebody has given  account that we need a resolution of this Parliament to continue with the Bottom in question.
By this reason *yo also agree in that we have to unify it more possible the statistics on the movement, the politics and the commercialisation of our agricultural products and that it #would be well that did not have each State, at least in his statistics, a distinct representation of the relative facts to our agricultural economy.
In the economic terrain, in the past exercise *Polonia has experienced a high index of annual growth, as it already has said the Mrs. *Hoff, with a reduction of the unemployment and of the inflation, a stable coin and a growth of the direct foreign investments.
From this Parliament have defended always the institution of the Defender of the Village, as *garante of the protection of the rights of the citizens to the hour to report cases of possible bad administration by part of the institutions and community organs, and the need to intensify the relations among said institutions and the citizens.
This action of divulging has to be carried out by the community institutions through the media and audiovisual, and like this #would avert, among other consequences, that, for example, more of the 69 % of the claims presented in front of the Defender in the last years were out of the field of his competition as, for example, the big number of *ellas that have like object the restrictions to the free circulation, and that present  every year in front of the Defender.
To end to amend the current informative deficit in the field of the rights of the citizens of the EU urge to the services of the Parliament and of the Commission to that they set up direct lines of query in the different States members and that take advantage of in depth the possibilities offered by the telematic and the technology of the information.
It True is that, after the European Council, the 25 % goes back to the pockets of the States members, but the idea of the criteria of execution common follow being absolutely essential and to #that *respecto will ask to the Commissioner how repercussions has had, in his opinion, the European Council concerning the attitude of the authorities *aduaneras common and #if they are now less concerned that before.
*Nosotros Defend the rights of the human person against the rights of an inhuman and totalitarian State that launches by the routes of the exile to a population *aterrorizada, destroys the houses, threat and kills to women and boys; *nosotros defend the freedom and wish that the criminal are punished; therefore we support without reservation the brave decision of the Bosses of State and of #european Government.
For wanting to play with the international borders -the of *Yugoslavia from 1991, the of *Macedonia and of *Albania tomorrow-, for ignoring the lessons of the history, for pretending *desconocer the paper of *Rusia in this region, for looking for a military punishment more that a political solution, for wanting to especially suppress to the #serbian village of this *Europa by the that has worked so much, go to cause probably the *conflagración that simulate to want to avert.
Besides, the proposal of resolution affirms that the Nations Joined and the Council of Security « have not been able to» (!) Take part in the decision of the NATO on the aerial incursions, although it is clear that this decision has taken  breaking the principles of the Nations Joined, that in this case have seen  humiliated and abused of form *irremediable.
They are dangerous postures of frivolous advisers on the editorial of the proposal of resolution, that *envilecen #all serious effort for building an order and a really international community, that #can apply of plausible and viable form #such principles, without selective interventions and without the illogical utilisation of the violence.
The Commission is in total agreement with the gentleman speaker with regard to that, nevertheless the progresses reached with regard to the realisation of an only market of the financial services, the sales *transfronterizas of financial products to the by minor to the consumers follow being more the exception that the rule inside the European Union and continue existing still disparities of price very considerable among the States members.
I agree with the speaker in that for the authorities of regulation and of supervision, said advances represent new challenges that #can confront through a cooperation and effective coordination among the financial authorities of regulation and of supervision, with a clear cast of the responsibility of supervision and with solid financial regulations, necessary to manage the global institutional risk, #as well as the risk of the systems.
Like this as, #if today we have to give a fast and effective answer to the problems posed, is to say, indemnify to the families of the victims and *darles a moral and material support, #as well as pipe the influx of traffic that, because of the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, converges to the tunnel of the *Fréjus; also it is necessary to consider the question as a whole.
Of these seven millions, five allocate  to the electoral information by means of the *ONG, is to say, to the electoral training and to the information, and two millions to the sending of some sixty observers by the States members to Indonesian by a period of two weeks, but in the frame of the electoral observation wider organised, among other organisations, by the Nations Joined.
*B4-0382/99 of the deputies *Fassa and *André-*Léonard, in name of the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers-*B4-0394/99 of the deputy *Pasty, in name of the Group Union by *Europa-*B4-0409/99 of the deputies *Hory and *Castagnède, in name of the Group of Coalition Radical European-*B4-0420/99 of the deputies *Aelvoet and *Telkämper, in name of the Group of the Greens in the Parliament *Europeosobre *Níger;
285 members of parliament have gathered  in a group that pretends to reestablish the Parliament #would not be positive that the European Union loaned all his backrest, so that the Parliament, that was dissolved in his moment, have the opportunity to collaborate from another perspective in the preparation of a constitution that modify deeply, once and for all, the #burmese situation?
Of a side, wail deeply the murder in cold blood of a woman that put his personal life and professional to the service of the defence of the human rights, and of #another, *me saddens to have to check that here in the European Union, to the equal that in the rest of the world, determined strengths try to undermine with terrorist acts a process of peace in course.
The direction of the administrations *aduaneras from the EU is #one *intromisión in the national sovereignty that did not has to take place.2.The decisions adopted in the past by the EU have weakened the border controls among the States members, favouring the illegal activities and boosting the circulation of commodities of smuggling.
The juridical protection of the rights of the consumers has to follow being competition of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens and the rights of the consumers have to follow being competition of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, as it finishes to explain the Mr. *Collins.
The social speakers, the governmental organisations, the States members and the EU have to take, each #one in his field of responsibility, the timely countermeasures, is to say, coordinating and collaborating *sensatamente in the relative subjects to the third age in the EU and not acting *centralizadamente each #one from his field of responsibility.
Without embargo, exists a field related with the third age that presents great difficulties to the hour to introduce improvements, so much from a point of sight concrete as by means of the #european cooperation. *Me Am referring to the reciprocal recognition of social provision -like the subsidies by illness and the pensions- that affect in numerous occasions to the greater persons.
Gentleman President, the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of our Parliament proposes , in effect, subject to the executive Commission the problem of the deficit of the European Union in vegetal proteins inside the feeding allocated to the animals and the strategic challenge that comports this situation for the biotechnologies in the *Europa of the Fifteen.
Today, really, it did not has felt that they still exist *muchísimas differences among some representatives and #others, *cuando the reality is that, from the Treaty of *Maastricht and, more still, of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, goes  opening step the reality of this #european citizenship that demands to voices that his representatives take part of a common diet in #all the looks, but, of course and in particular, in the look of the suspension of the parliamentary immunity.
*Usted Agrees  that the examination of the *anejo *V in our commission began with a letter of the Mrs. *Theato, speaker of the Commission of Control Budgetary, that tackled specifically the question of #if the article 5 of this *anejo *V that foresees the absolute majority to refuse the approval of the management, was compatible with the disposals of the Treaty.
New earth were also the plans of action national and, to the contrary of the orator that *me has preceded, *yo believe that the guidelines of *Luxemburgo and the plans of action national, among other things, have derived  of the fact that have a tax of unemployment lower.
It #would not treat  to concede today the approval of the management to the Commission, against of it that the Council has taken acting with lightness and *despreocupación, since, as so well has explained *Laurens #Jan *Brinkhorst, #would not have to  concede the approval of the management to a Commission *dimisionaria that no longer is qualified to assume commitments on future orientations in front of the #european Parliament.
On the other hand, the fact that the measures do not affect to #all the countries of the European Union supposes a grave distortion of the rules of the competition in the only market, aggravating the negative consequences on those companies that yes will see  affected by these high tariffs imposed by States Joined in his sanctions.
The political solution that try to reach is a political solution that suspend the use of the strength on the base of the respect of the human rights, of the common security, of the return of #all the refugees, on the base of the international community of nations.
In interest of the agreement, consider that *ello is admissible always that #such exceptions limit  in the measure of it possible and suppose a step to the creation of an only and uniform Statute and, especially, serve to reach the establishment, it before possible, of a diet of reward equal for #all the deputies to the European Parliament.
Therefore, the preliminary draft of budget general has to postpone the subject of the possibility to hire new personnel and his previous endowment until they remain clear the *márgenes that possibly have  in the frame of the new institutional agreement and until the new Commission have the opportunity to define his requirements.
Fulfilled the community juridical obligation to approve a new directive to replace the directive cancelled, to my trial it more important, is a vital step to a common frame to differentiate the systems of *gravámenes in the group of the European Union.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the goal of the proposal is to facilitate the sale by telephone, by *fax and by Internet of financial services #such as the banking, the insurances, the investments and the credits *hipotecarios, protecting at the same time to the consumer against the fraud, against the high pressure of the arguments of sale and against #some uses no requested of the technicians of communication to distance.
Therefore, in my quality of member of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, always have supported, to the pair of the Mrs. *Kuhn and the Mr. *Whitehead, measures that guarantee that it provides  a real protection adapted to the needs and worries of the consumers thanks to the #european legislation.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0124/99) of the Mrs. *González *Álvarez, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that creates  a program of action community in favour of the civil protection (*COM(98)0768 - *C4-0072/99-98/0354(*CNS))
Never will forget like *yo, as young President of my party at the beginning of the years seventy, took part together with his father in a rally in a hall of cinema of *Madrid, with scarce public and under some difficult conditions, #where already in #that then under the direction of his father gave expression to the ideal and convictions of our philosophy, to the values and principles *democristianos and, especially, also, to our #european federalistic conviction.
It is evident, without embargo, that at the side of the indispensable budgetary consolidation, *Europa has to accelerate the structural reforms of the markets of the employment, of the sakes, of the services and of the capital, and is in this spirit in the that the Commission finishes to approve the relative recommendation to the great orientations of economic politics.
In front of #all the forecasts, the #german Presidency closed the package of the Diary 2000, that seemed difficult to close, and now, for the European Council of Colony, the Presidency *nos finishes to announce a quite ambitious program. I congratulate also to the #german Presidency by the ambition of this program.
Of this resolution and of the debates that celebrated  *permítome stand out #one or two looks that, for me, are the most important: the idea that opened  and opens  path of a #european constitution, the verification or the wish of verification of a power *constituyente specific in the community level and some interpretation -*permítome say it like this- *correctiva of the article *N of the Treaty.
In place of a clear *reorientación of the #european politics in the *primer year of the euro to a new type of economic development that #can solve the problem of the unemployment in mass,  *nos gives a European Pact by the Employment that remains very by behind it that in his day contained the initiative *Santer and the proposals *originarias *provenientes of the Presidency elaborated by the #german Ministry of Inland revenue.
No only for the fruitful cooperation among the institutions but also to ensure of durable mood it that reach  in the Conference *Intergubernamental and that his application succeed, in the future will be necessary that the Parliament take part more acutely that in the past in this Conference -do not employ consciously the expression of Conference *Intergubernamental although it was the usual practice but the of Conference of the States members.
It That we want to it is to contribute to facilitate the things to the Governments, and therefore, with the agreement in his day of the President *Santer -to the one who want *rendir homage thus-, think that a possibility, a fine possibility, is that the European Commission prepare a project, that argue it with the Parliament and that take part also the national Parliaments in this reflection, that will be a mere reflection, gentleman President.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, the questions related with the employment have happened to occupy the position that deserve in the politics of the European Union and *Alemania is exerting in the actuality pressures to reach a #european agreement in matter of employment with reason of the Summit of Colony.
Gentleman President, apart from that *me seems quite surprising that *nos see forced to *comportarnos as in a fair to have right to take the word in this Parliament *cuando are deputies, wanted to say simply that it is the first occasion in the that see that, in an Assembly like #this, *cuando pronounce  two contrary opinions, a pertinent of the competent services and the #another of the president of the Commission of Regulation chosen by his equal, considers  the of the services in question.
After #a lot of years of efforts, had seen the light an as a whole acceptable proposal and the Council had shown  had to negotiate with this Parliament, in the moment of the result of the vote of today, with seen to reach a commitment.
In the case of the bananas, do not allows  to the EU take a commercial granting to small countries that they were his colonies (countries *ACP) and in the that the bananas represent the *pilar main of his economies, it that results particularly grave because this politics of the EU inscribes  in the spirit of the Agreements of *Lomé, that date of 1963, and are, therefore, very previous to the current Agreement of Trade *Multilateral (Treaty of *Marraquech - 1994).
And I finish remembering an already mentioned point by the Mrs. *Jöns: it is incomprehensible that the Council was not had to include of explicit form the *gender *mainstreaming -and is it especially after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam that considers the equality of opportunities the fundamental principle of the Union- that constitutes likewise #one of it four *pilares of the #european strategies in matter of employment.
Since to date the #turkish Government *deniega this just process and public through evident actions (obstacles for the defence, rejection of the requests that they are observant presents, etc.), how measured thinks to take the Council to protect the physical and psychic integrity of the leader *kurdo #as well as the rights, evident for the societies civilised, that have #all the accused in front of the justice?
*Yo Want to *referirme specifically to the structural Bottoms, to the Bottom of Cohesion and to the politics of cohesion, saying that I agree in the «how », as it has projected it the Commissioner -and even take advantage of once again to say that we have to congratulate to the Commissioner and to the *DG *XVI because we have been with *ella, and *ella *nos has helped deeply in the advances of the cohesion in the *periplo of these five years and *yo believe that, in his design, of the next-.
In the course of the negotiations reached  for the zones of crop more northern of the EU, that also are to #the same time the most northern of #everyone, a pair of #granting important so as to balance the costs derived of the adverse climatological conditions.
I receive *favorablemente the decision of the Commission to revoke his proposal to demand to the fishermen the acquisition of a 30 % additional of *tonelaje, which, in case that it had prospered the proposal, only #can have described like a penal law directed to hinder the urgent need of *modernizar and renew the fleet.
The intermediate posture, to the that also adheres  the Presidency, pretends to incorporate the development and the operation of the *SIS #as well as the majority of the categories object of register to the *tercer *pilar whereas the category of the denial of visas and the relative disposals to the protection of the personal data #would be also present in the *primer *pilar.
The big work to know where stop, because this directive has a special characteristic, and is that it do not tries *reglamentarlo #everything, but it that *reglamenta it *reglamenta with sense and with an idea behind, with a conductive idea and guideline, and *yo believe that this Parliament #would take badly in changing these balances, #would take badly in trying modify this so delicate situation and that, in my modest opinion, is frankly very achieved.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #some of the colleagues that have talked before that *yo already have remembered the article 5 of the Agreement of *Lomé, signed also by *Djibuti, that establishes a true interrelationship, a functional link among the respect and the enjoy of the political and civil rights, of the fundamental human freedoms and the help to the development.
Likewise it is necessary that the international community, also through the Organisation for the African Unit, but with an active paper of the European Union, guarantee said agreement and act with regard to elaborating a program of helps economic so much urgent as on a long-term basis that they allow an economic reconstruction of the island.
By a part, the States members began to negotiate on the base of the ancient article 220 of the Treaty *CE an agreement #whose object was to regulate of horizontal mood the effects *intracomunitarios of the failure, determining the judicial competition and the applicable law to declare the insolvency of a company.
It is the case of countries of the *sudeste #asian, #Asia central, of the ancient #soviet Republics and of the Republics *bálticas, to the that has added  the increase without precedents of the imports *provenientes of *Turquía owing to the closing of the #russian market and of the industrial capacity of this country, of *Turquía, that has  *sobredimensionado in the course of the last five years.
*Yo Believe that only it appreciates  it that do not has  and the fact that the #european institutions have endowed  of a Parliament, with #all his defects and with #all his problems, and that this Parliament convert  in this term of office in a fundamental piece of the community mechanism, is *algo that the #european citizens #would have to begin to value.
The coincidence in the time of the resignation of the Commission, the beginning of the war of *Kosovo and the European Council of *Berlín subjected to a dramatic proof the capacity of performance of the European Union in an extremely critical moment.
#If *Europa had to pursue the goal that signalled the President *Prodi -offer to the *Balcanes a political and economic future clear- #would reach *algo great, but #would not exert fully his task that is the to contribute substantially to build a path of development democratic, certainly economic, but fundamentally social and cultural, conscious that the reconciliation is so much stronger and stable what more is  *tolerante and respectful with the diversities.
In this case -the experience of the *EEB- the Commission is amply innocent, and the States members have gone back to take his games under the mantle of the subsidiariness without having had prowess for, for example, have elaborated of a time a directive mark relative to foods that constituted an advantage for *Europa and to the that  *atuviesen the countries members.
More that #that *peroratas ideological of another period that ask the return of the ancient collusion *supranacional among the Parliament and the Commission against the Council, had preferred to listen, of the mouth of the Mr. *Prodi, the concrete way in that it thinks to repair, in a field of his competition, the *estragos caused by the Commissions precedents and the negotiations of the Round *Uruguay.
Lady Speaker, as it has said the deputy *Sánchez, there are errors in the record, but no only because the Mr. *Sánchez was included in the Group of the European Radical Alliance, that do not exists -case that *le has occurred also to the deputies #Bautista, *Hudghton and *MacCormick- but that *yo same, that belong to the Group of the Green/Free Alliance European, appear in the Group of No Inscribed.
The reading of the second inform of the Committee of Experts puts of self-evident that had #a lot of reason in asking to the five experts that continued his investigations and his reflection further of the case of #one or another commissioner, in particular, to take a more general diagnostic on the group of the institution.
In effect, quote the report: "For *incoar a penal procedure to the civil servants of the Commission, the national jurisdiction that it treat  has to request the suspension of the official immunity treating of suspicious, of the professional secret treating of witnesses and of the inviolability of the buildings of the Commission in case of registers and to be able to have access to the documents" .
Why, #if there #be *tanta worry in the States members, do not asks  to these States members that the communities and the municipalities make a debate in the Parliament, on the results and the destinations of the bottoms, so that in these countries take place a public debate that was in relation with our work and that these two questions are not separated among *ellas?
In the meantime, we have to negotiate an agreement mark that it constitute a solid base to improve our institutional relations, with measures of transparency and information, as they are the have of the documents of work of the Council, of the records of the meetings of the School of Commissioners, except *cuando agree  his confidentiality, or a system of information on the works of the *OLAF with the owed discretion.
*Europa Has taken  to transmit a project, and in these times of globalisation in the that the citizens have the feeling of that #all the important decisions take  in another part, and especially in the world of the finances, is important to recover the idea of a project for *Europa that comprise the citizens and defend the institutions.
*Yo Share fully the content of his program, devoted to the *glasnost, that do not proposes  a small "*reformilla" of the institutions, but a reform of big *calado, that pursues the creation of places of sustainable work by means of a consistent liberalisation, that concedes a very important place to the subsidiariness, that considers necessary to answer of suitable way to the demographic evolution in *Europa.
*Me Has bumped -have to confess it- that it have been clear regarding the freedom of trade and to the requirements of competitiveness of the companies and have omitted -or have shown  wander to the *respecto- the fight against the unemployment, the poverty and the social exclusion, true *flagelos of the European Union.
Gentleman President designated, the members of the #french socialist delegation have the worry by the effective operation of the institutions, which means the instauration of a strong Commission, in the sense of the respect by the Treaties, is to say, with the coincidence among his mandate and the #ours.
#If we do not want to lose in solidity it that win in extension, #if we want to give a soul to the *Europa of the market and of the only coin, #if we want to go back to win the confidence of the citizens and of the villages, have to work in common -Commission, Parliament and Council- in it only that it #can offer a solid base and a new impulse: the #european citizenship, a letter of rights, a true constitution.
And as  *me accused of *deslealtad, it only that I want to say in this moment is that, in accordance with these criteria and with the demonstrations of the President *Prodi in relation with the responsibility of the Commissioners, believe that, #if today it approves  in this Assembly the resolution of content political, *consensuada by #all the Groups, on the new Commission, the Mr. *Galeote goes  to find in an Assembly of disloyal.
Already they discern  points of agreement. For example, regarding the importance that concedes  to the access to the justice, to the preparation of a coherent strategy in matter of immigration and asylum, to the protection of the feeblest groups and more exposed to the discriminations, or to the strengthening of the mechanisms used in the fight against the delinquency organised.
Also it remains out of the democratic control the preparation of the document 19 of *Enfopol and also another type of offences, #such as the related with the performances of the police cooperation *Ilets, the collaboration in matter of espionage *Echelon and the bilateral treaties of the Services of Security of States Joined and the European Union.
While it last this parliamentary gap will be impossible to create a space of security, freedom and justice on a truly democratic base, since the realisation of said space involves the presence of a structure integrated by the right to the individual protection and the possibility to take part in the individual surroundings.
I recognise that it has engaged  to fulfil five requests of the Group of the *EVP, among *ellas the that refer  to the right of the *PE to present legislative proposals, to the behaviour of the Commissioners in case that it produce  a vote of censorship and to the need to board a permanent dialogue on the reform of the Commission.
Subject: Help of the EU for the maritime services of *Irlanda since *Irlanda possesses #one of the greater maritime zones of patrol of the EU, responsibility so important for *Irlanda as for the EU in his group and that covers activities like the surveillance and interception of loads of drugs, protection of the industry *pesquera and security of the navigation, #would want the Council expose how initiatives that #would have to take  to scale of the EU in help to the efforts made by *Irlanda in this sector?
To facilitate his fulfillment, in the regulations and managerial of the Union specify  the procedures of collaboration and exchange of information among the States members, with the end to avert simultaneous performances and to facilitate the identification of the ships, achieving so they harmonise  the moods to proceed of the distinct countries.
*Me Seems a frankly problematic solution put that really it do not treats  of the fusion of two structures but of a process of adhesion. And although I consider the possibility to establish transitory periods, as it took  before, do not conceive that a country candidate #can go in to form part of the European Union without that it have assimilated the *acervo community in his whole.
In this frame, the perspective to create a "social order European" based in the practice of *Schengen #can not be more that the arsenal *antidemocrático that, in a determined moment, #can use against the political and #sindical action, against the reactions of the workers in front of the politics *antipopular of the European Union and of the States members.
Although they have produced  #some changes in the political situation from then, regret to say that the requirements for the resumption of the cooperation for the development and the full normalisation of the relations with *Togo - the respect of the democratic principles, the state of right and the human rights - still do not fulfil  satisfactorily.
The Commission considers that the European Union, together with the rest of the international community, has to take conclusive measures to contain the repercussions of the crisis in the countries of the region of the Great Lakes that, as they have affirmed the deputies, loom of distinct forms the security and the stability in #all *África.
I want still *recordarles to #all the colleagues that takes only a pair of weeks the Parliament, when accepting the Commission, approved a statement in the that underlined  that it wishes  progress to work in the negotiations on the international treaties and even in the distinct stages of the negotiations, so that it #would be really regrettable, #if the Parliament left this opportunity without taking advantage of.
I am not sure of #if it is allowed to take an explanation of vote in this stage of the debate, but #if it is like this, wanted to say that, from the point of sight of the population of *Escocia, believe that it is a pity that tomorrow debate on the alimentary security without including a case in the that a Been member is challenging the *dictamen of the Community in this matter.
As they know #all *ustedes, *Señorías, the sources of energy renewable, in the systems of support -except the energy of origin hydraulic, #where himself/hisself achieve  results very competitive with regard to another type of sources energetic-, #can not compete with the energies of type traditional.
It wanted to indicate to the Mr. *Prodi that #a lot of economists believe that the most important factors for the competitiveness in the industry #would be, in the first place, a reduction of the taxes of societies and of the business contributions and, second, of the enormous and in intolerable truth charge of regulation that plants to *Europa in a situation very *desventajosa in relation with other parts of the world.
As a result of the approval of the Common Action, the Commission took part in a series of management of the troika, directed to present the Common Action to #all the Governments and the important regional organisations and collect his political support for his goals.
Gentleman President, believe that this debate and the motion that today are debating put openly of self-evident the will of this Parliament to send a signal of opening clear, strong and amicable, a signal that takes note of the change of attitude of the #greek Government regarding the #turkish Government.
I receive with satisfaction the proposal of commitment relative to *Turquía, because it achieves a correct balance among the need to confirm to *Turquía his right to incorporate  to the EU and the need that *Turquía undertake a series of reforms economic and political before his appeal take  'effective' .
To be able to establish the suitable commitments among the different and complex problems to that confronts  at present the system of the international trade, seems fundamental that the conversations cover a wide diary that include from the reductions of the traditional tariffs until crucial subjects like the environment and norms of work, in addition to new looks like the competition and the investment.
By this reason expects  that the Council, during the #finnish Presidency, get to conclusions for his realisation and by the that the Council gives the welcome to the intention of the Commission to present, so prompt as it was possible, a proposal for a new plan of action that boost the equality of opportunities among men and women and to ensure that #this will follow  applying *cuando remain without vigour the current.
Also we explain to these effects with the article 13 of the Treaty on the European Union, but *cuando treats  of concrete cases have to take into account that the Union do not has own police, but that the responsibility on the security of the citizens *recae in the governments and in the strengths of the order of each country.
According to the article 48 of the statutes of the #ECB, the States members that are not included in the zone of the euro will have to pay a lower percentage of the that *les #would correspond, #if like this it decides it the Managerial Joint of the #ECB, in concept of participation in the costs of operation of the #ECB.
It will be an enormous quantity, already treat  of *Dinamarca or of another country, and this maximum  fixed, very understood, by means of decision by majority of the Council on the base of a proposal of the Council of Government, that likewise takes his decisions by majority, since each country has the weight of vote, to the that *le authorises his contribution.
The question has like this a political solution - do not see possible the bellicose solution- and in this way now have the opportunity to help to *Rusia, that in any case finds  in a difficult political situation, loaning help to find a solution and achieve some relative negotiations to the question of *Chechenia.
The #russian army has gone in in the territory of the republic and has invaded, according to his own versions, a third of the territory of #the same *ocasionando deaths, destruction and the massive exodus of more of 100.000 refugees -women, boys and elderly- that are received in the neighbour *Ingushetia, #whose President talks already of humanitarian catastrophe and asks an international help that do not finishes to get.
I do not know #if, in addition to the results achieved by the #italian judicature lately, will have or will not have other stages like the that, lamentably, *nos have accustomed to see through the judicial avatars of *Ustica in these years; without embargo, today *nos find in front of a sentence that proposes the hypothesis of a contest of planes of varied countries in the accident of *Ustica of 27 June 1980.
#Few minutes after the disaster the military planes and the secret services of the countries involved in the military operation - the Italians in the first place - set up a gigantic and shameful operation to hide, by not saying, destroy the proofs to end to prevent that the judicial authority discovered how was it that *sucedió really in the sky of *Ustica.
Therefore, it wanted to direct finally a call to the Council so that it fix the common position on these projects of directive with the greater possible rapidity, with *tanta amplitude as it was possible, of course, on the base of the amendments of this Parliament in the first reading, to end to present the common position in *segunda reading to the Parliament.
The *derramamiento of fuel owed  to that the cover of the deposits of fuel were not very installed, and the Directive that the Parliament has now in front of yes, with the amendments taken by the Parliament in *segunda reading with regard to giving greater rigour to these disposals, occupies  of this question demanding that the deposits of fuel of the vehicles of engine possess mechanisms of appropriate closing so that the covers was always very adjusted.
On the base of this orientation and of the knowledge of the that they will be #all the parameters examined from a point of sight *exquisitamente technical, ask, #if it is possible, that the Parliament and, in particular, the commission, are informed and especially ask #if it is possible that the Commission *nos inform on #which goes to be the course that will give  to the application of this directive from the point of sight *exquisitamente technical.
#This has to  -suits to highlight it-to the following reason: the necessary outlays, particularly in the case of the structural politics, will increase  the next year like result of the commitments subscribed in previous years and the Commission coincides fully with the Parliament in that it is not possible to consign inferior totals to the necessary to cover the already subscribed commitments.
*Yo Entrust in that, on the base of the previous work made by #all the institutions and especially of the present reports of the Parliament, will achieve to reach, through a process of negotiation adapted and open, an agreement on the Budget 2000 that take justice to our big political responsibility in the field of the #european politics.
In effect the politics is not a game among the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, that practise in own interest, but that our purpose is to create the best possible conditions for the development of the European Union and to offer some favourable conditions to the persons for the that work.
In *tercer place, the maintenance of the stability of the prices serves to the interests of justice social and help to protect to the feeblest members of our society, like pensioners and unemployed, that depend of #a fixed income and #can not protect of the costs of the inflation with other sakes, for example properties or actions.
In this context, *yo wanted to *recordarle to the Mrs. *Randzio-*Plath that the Treaty expresses of way very clear that the *primer goal of the Central Bank European is the stability of the prices and that only will be able to try reach the other goals *cuando *ello do not put in danger said stability of the prices, and also that the stability of the prices has in himself/hisself same -#such as it has manifested the President- social and economic effects positive
Likewise, my Government promoted the approval of a new Penal Code Soldier that includes substantial advances regarding the competition of the civil courts to judge to the soldiers in crimes like the genocide, the disappearance *forzosa and the torture, and sign the Statute of the International Penal Court.
The so proclaimed space of freedom, security and justice is not another thing that the affirmation of a bureaucratic concept and *represivo of the politics in the *cual talks  so much of security and little of freedom and of justice, as they show it the dense series of conferences *intergubernamentales, *Dublín, *Europol, *Eurodac, *Eurojust and the mutual assistance in judicial matter that exclude the democratic control of the Parliament, #as well as of the Commission and of the Court of Justice.
Against the idea that #ours Union has to be exclusive or mainly of economic character, the Council, in the line that the Parliament came already defending from took a lot, happened to occupy  of the citizens, of his freedom of circulation, of his security and of the recognition of the right to the justice, rights that have to recognise  no only to the citizens of the Union, but also to #all those that by diverse circumstances find  legally in our territory.
Like this and #everything, wanted to recommend to the Commission - do not know #if it is here the gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen but, anyway, already argue it in the general debate - some urgency in the case that it had to present  a rule mark *concerniente to #all the matters, to end to tackle, organic and thoroughly, a so delicate subject from the point of sight institutional.
The special Summit of *Tampere, to the time that has centred  in the politics of immigration and asylum, also has treated seriously the subject of the traffic of human beings that has not left to grow during the last years.
In January will have the final proposal on the observatory, on the that *me reserve the right to debate with the European Parliament to see #if it has to have an observatory for the small and medium enterprises, that the report on it that goes to *suceder, and that also have felt of connection to national level of the local observatories so that the companies are all it prepared that they #can for the future changes.
#This is a principle that has to apply even in the case that the helps loan  to a no community company, in #whose case considers  that an agreement of cooperation with the country of the company, there #where did not exist, no only #can define and integrate better the interventions of the Union in favour of this country, but that, in the new desirable contingency, #can facilitate the execution of said sanction.
And I think that, really, have things that learn of the States Joined of *América in the subject of the monetary stability or in the subject of the utilisation of high technologies and of fast operations to this level; but of course, it exists a big difference in *Europa: the cultural model, social and historical of *Europa is based in the powerful social powers and in the balance among the society and the economy.
Gentleman President, in the first place wanted to say, in name of my Group, that are very disappointed by the fact that it have not included  in the resolution a call to #all the States members of the European Union and to #all the countries candidates so that they support the new proposal of coalition in the agenda that is on the table of the 55ª General Assembly of Nations Joined.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0038/1999) in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [13175/1/1999 - *C5-0022/1999 - 1998/0197(*COD)] with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  the program of action community "Youth" (Speaker: Mrs. *Gröner).
The Group of the Party of the European Socialists, in #all the process of preparation of the budget, has defended with energy the ideas of solidarity and of commitment of the Union regarding the most disadvantaged, to end to satisfy the goal of eradication of the poverty.
#If the enormous resources allocated to the nuclear proofs and to the *armamentismo release  and pipe  to productive investments in the direction of the economic and social cohesion, to the education, the culture and the protection of the environment, #can reinforce the factors of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence of the villages and contribute to the *reforzamiento of the bows of *reprocidad and of cooperation *paritaria.
Like this, as, we have to signal the dangers that of *ello give off and here have also now new and unavoidable consequences, in particular the requirements that there #be more #moroccan fishermen in the community crafts, the licence of fishing *restrictivamente related with new mixed companies, the obligation of the disembarkment of the fish in the #moroccan ports, in addition to #granting in the agricultural sphere, etc.
And the Commissioner did not finishes to get to the Commission, is a Commissioner that proceeds of the previous Commission and precisely with #the same wallet and #the same file, by it that has a specific responsibility and own politics and very concrete no only in the resolution of this problem, but also in the of the problems posed until it concretise  again the agreement.
My political Group wishes that there #be a just agreement and balanced with the Realm of *Marruecos by part of the European Union, but also think that, to avert these periodic marketings that generate enormous anxieties and difficult situations for the fishermen, the future agreement #would have to remain consolidated in the frame of the Agreement of association.
But #all this discussion evidence the need of an independent organism that occupy  of the alimentary rule in the EU, that avert the undue influence of the national organs, very often conditioned by a personal interest, and that control the corresponding practices in #all the European Union.
In #Italia the *concertación among the social speakers and the Governments has converted  in a pact among the representatives of the interests constituted - #sindical, *patronales, politicians - directed to defend the interests constituted and the incomes in place of the possibility to achieve a space in the new economy of the unemployed and of #all #that that are not represented in the *concertación.
*Exigirles That work an average of 60 hours to the week during a period of four weeks is an exploitation, by a part, of these young individuals that have to fulfil with his practices to obtain his professional title and, by #another, of #all *nosotros, of the public, that have to consult to these medical youngsters in practices in the services of assistance and of urgency.
In the Realm Joined, for example, the proposals are more advanced that this directive and have been received with *beneplácito by #Andrew *Hobart, president of the committee of doctors auxiliary, the one who says that it is loved with that have reached  an agreement on a new agreement for the auxiliary doctors that will guarantee in advance a safe labour day in the Realm Joined.
By it that refers  more fundamentally to the political question formulated on *Chechenia, is evident that share with His *Señorías #the same questions, #the same anxieties, but the question posed is the following: until the present, the European Union has not suspended neither reduced his diplomatic relations with *Rusia, because we think that it always has to have courses of dialogue with *Rusia to transmit our messages, included the relative to our restlessness by it that is occurring in *Chechenia.
Still today it has  the idea that the inner market is a subject of multinationals, of great companies, of *burócratas, of *Bruselas, of *tecnócratas that are far of the worries of the persons of on foot, of #a lot of initiatives that  *apilan #one on #others without order neither concert, without conductive idea that, in #a lot of cases, are perceived like #one *pesadumbre more in the already heavy charge to live in a community developed or to have a small or an average business.
And in this sense wanted to highlight that the Commission will have #a lot of taste in listening every year in the appropriate dates the observations and the ideas of the European Parliament *cuando get the hour to examine thoroughly and follow developing the concrete goals in the frame of the annual cycle.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0040/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the information on the consumption of fuel facilitated to the consumer when commercialising vehicles of new tourism (5617/2/1999 -*C5-0037/1999 - 1998/0272(*COD)) (Commission of Environment, Public and Political Health of the Consumers) (Speaker: Mr. *Sterckx)
But then, by coherence, our Parliament #would have to reconsider the decision that his majority judged that it had to adopt about a Group that had respected the independence of vote of his members and the had taken to appear in his internal regulation, it that did not excludes the existence of affinities political in the sense of the quoted article 29.
#If we decide to postpone this subject -as it thought the majority in the Conference of Presidents-, #one of the tasks to make from this time on until December, will be the to request to the President of the Court of Accounts that undertake a wide investigation, to know #if the leak produced  in the Court of Accounts or in #any another institution.
Lady Speaker, the legislative project subjected to debate results very significant from the point of sight of the environmental protection, since it affects directly to the quality of the breathable air, is to say, to the content of dioxide of nitrogen and to the resultant ozone, affects all *ello to the grade of acidity and to the level of *entropización.
Gentleman President, in moments in that it celebrates  the *décimo anniversary of this Convention, in #whose text recognises  to the boy like subject singular, and  *le attribute own rights (right to the life, right to the identity and to a family, right of expression, right to be fed and polite), know very well that in our continent, each thirty seconds abuses , violates or *descuartiza and indoctrinates to a boy, victim of some unsuitable politics, of familiar and economic changes, and victim also of the fact that we do not apply this international Convention.
Regarding the first, to the fundamental rights, in the breast of the Union, of compliance with the article 6 of the Treaty, are forced to respect the fundamental rights and, specifically, the freedoms and the fundamental rights of the man, #such as they result of the common constitutional traditions to our States members.
On the failures of security in *Bohunice do not need to debate, only *me allow to stand out the three more important points: it follows without having any replacement for the concrete armed that lacking, do not exists any reduction of the pressure or other systems of security. The modernisation is not sufficient from a point of sight *sismológico.
*Señorías, in the year 1994 took  a series of decisions -precisely to concede helps to distinct #european companies- so as to carry out a restructuring of #the same that allowed, on the one hand, his eventual privatisation but, in any case, finished of a time with the subventions and helps of State that, somehow, distorted the only market and the free competition among the distinct actors in the aerial market liberalised.
The European Commission has indicated by it other to the countries candidates in diverse occasions the so important paper that #can exert the social speakers in the process of adhesion and has remembered to #the same time that have more in account the social problems presupposes that it develop  the social dialogue in the countries candidates.
Lady Speaker, to finish, *les will say very in brief that in these four last weeks have had #many other profitable meetings: with the President of *Colombia, that was received also here in this Parliament in session *plenaria, with the President of *Letonia, with the minister of Subjects External of *Chipre, to treat to see the mood to promote the meetings that go to begin surely on 3 December in New *York.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0062/1999) of the Mr. *Schwaiger, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament - The Approach of the EU on the Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC (*COM(1999)331 - *C5-0155/1999 - 1999/2149(*COS)).
To my seem, with *él has achieved to transmit three signals: a signal of the unit of the European Union, directed to our speakers all over the world; a signal of the human face of the globalisation, directed to our population; and a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the process of the *OMC, directed to our citizens.
The lady *Barchawski, special representative of the president #Clinton for the trade, that has conducted with hit the battles of #Washington on the banana, the *OGM and the meat of *vacuno #american, has asked to the centres of businesses #american, that *le have provided a document of 31 pages detailing the wishes of his industries.
This project has like goals centre the attention in the violence to the woman, strengthen the contrary attitudes to the violence, diminish the cases of violence, #as well as develop and take more effective the services directed to attend so much to the victims, as to the authors of acts violent.
We initiate this new round of conversations with the advantage of the wisdom that gives the experience and with the knowledge that the States Joined, when getting to his position negotiator, to the equal that in the past, will have investigated the unseen agenda on how establish means to divert  of said agreement and help to his producers, whereas to #the same time demand to *Europa that fulfil faithfully with his commitments.
Gentleman President, believe that the Round of the #Millenium is an important occasion to boost the opening of the international markets to the competition, to expand the guarantees against the practices directed to avert the competition and to tackle at last the subject of the investments.
It is important that the Report *Schwaiger and this Parliament recognise in the World-wide Organisation of the Trade the appropriate forum for a serious negotiation in matter of investments looking for the certainty and the transparency of the right for the protection of the investments, #as well as, obviously, the *tutela of the state legislations in social matter, environmental and cultural.
#If *Europa and the States Joined argue now on the genetically modified organisms and the use of the hormones and antibiotics in the industry grazier, the improvement of the access to the market of the countries in roads develop and his participation in the world-wide economy loom with happening to a flat second.
From 1950 until 1970 the world-wide economic growth was quite parallel to the expansion of the world-wide trade, but from then the economic growth has gone growing only to the half of the rhythm of the world-wide exports: therefore, at all it shows that a greater trade conduct automatically to a greater economic growth.
It is precise that #this establish  clearly, to the equal that also has to remain clear that the *codecisión of the European Parliament in the field of the agricultural politics in reality do not covers, rigorously talking, the group of the legislation in matter of agricultural politics, but only a small part of the 3.000 legislative acts -some 20 or 30 maybe-, without embargo has to award  to the European Parliament power of *codecisión in said fields and also full competitions in relation with the agricultural budget.
This program splits of the commitment of the *PNUCD to fund activities of development in specific zones of crop of opium, and, as *contrapartida, the Talibans have accessed to not allowing the crop of opium in new zones, to that the *PNUCD supervise the crops of opium and to begin to take measures to struggle against the illegal traffic of drugs and to destroy the laboratories *clandestinos.
It wanted to express also my sincerer gratitude to the Parliament, and in particular to the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, of Justice and of Inner Subjects, #as well as to the speaker, Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, by the quality of his work and by the speed with the that have recommended the communication of the Commission on the fight against the drug in the period 2000 to 2004.
Report (To5-0059/1999) of the Mr. *Pirker, in name of the Commission of Freedoms, of Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the proposal of Regulation (*CE) of the relative Council to the creation of the system "*Eurodac" for the comparison of the impressions *dactilares of the applicants of asylum and other foreigners (*COM(1999) 260 - *C5-0082/1999 - 1999/0116(*CNS))
is not more that the representative of the industrial and of the financial groups more powerful of the European Union, rival of the *trusts North American or Japanese in the *imposición of onerous sacrifices to the planet, but #all are exclusively concerned for increasing his gains, in detriment of the workers of his own countries and of the villages of the poor countries.
. (*NL) By the present the #dutch delegation of the *PSE declares not being able to support the Report *PIRKER, that has approved  today, on the proposal of regulation of the relative Council to the creation of the system "*Eurodac" for the comparison of the impressions *dactilares of the applicants of asylum and other foreigners.
In *Irlanda varied successive governments have manifested to varied governments of the Realm Joined his restlessness by the tax of accidents in the facilities *nucleoeléctricas of Big *Bretaña, particularly the tax of accidents in the plant of *Sellafield, situated in the western coast of the Realm Joined that it is the less populated, but only to some those that miles of our oriental coast, that is the most populated.
Finally, it suits to reaffirm that the relative decisions to the process of independence of *Timor Oriental *incumben to his village, with respect of his sovereignty, by it that the decisions on his present and his future have to be adopted in narrow collaboration with the National Council of the Resistance *Timorense and no *incumbe to the international organisations *substituir to the village of *Timor Oriental, but -*eso yes- *darle #all the necessary support.
By it that refers  to the judicial procedures of a sovereign State, the European Commission will follow watching to achieve that the Mr. *Nikitin was object of an impartial trial and public based in the principles of the European Agreement for the Protection of the Human Rights and in the Russian Constitution.
The military hit in *Pakistán deserves an unambiguous and cutting conviction. We ask to the leaders that restore the State of right and the constitutional order and that by means of the instauration of a civil government of transition and in accordance with a previously established calendar celebrate elections and reestablish the parliamentary legitimacy.
There are proofs that the delinquency organised has found an easy and yielding business with the illegal traffic of human beings, that often are had to pay it that had saved during #all his life to end to be able to go in in the rich western countries, with the hope to be able to initiate a new life.
And now the Mr. Newton *Dunn, with the pretext that the Parliament #can not influence so much in the third column as in his juridical base, has posed to change #this, and for *ello has limited the group of reference corresponding to those affected by the politics of security of the first column of the European Union.
The special *empecinamiento of the *BEI in questions of public control and transparency *propició that the *ECOFIN manifested it following the 8.10.1999, and I quote *textualmente: "taking into account the important financial task that the Treaty and a series of regulations community award to the European Bank of Investments #would owe this keep an exemplary position in the fight against the fraud and allow to the *OLAF make the pertinent investigations #if it gave  the case.
The speaker #Manuel *Medina has explained of rigorous form and with #all luxury of arguments juridical how Canarian has come  defending from takes centuries, inside the #spanish context, with distinct mechanisms that allowed to those distant islands surpass the negative circumstances to the that before *me have referred, and with the wit, the *tesón and the effort of his men and women resist first and afterwards go constituting little by little in societies reasonably modern and prosperous.
Then it fixed  a transitory period of ten years so that the integration of the #canarian economy in the community world did not go traumatic for #some productive sectors venues and, of *facto, established , #among others looks, a *arbitrio on the production and on the imports, the *APIM, so as to protect the integration of the small basic industries Canarians in the territory *aduanero community.
It will be necessary to watch very attentively so that the next negotiations of the *OMC allow to put end to the unacceptable practices of *dumping that carry out #some countries, and that do not put in danger to a sector that is subjected to an intense world-wide competition, since it gives work to #a lot of hand of drama hardly *automatizable and subjected, therefore, to strong pressures in favour of the trip to countries in the that the costs of the hand of drama are very inferior to the existent in the European Union.
And it that it wanted to ask to the Government of the #spanish State and to the political parties Spaniards from this forum is #the same height of watch that they have had the British and Irish, so that we #can #all find a path of peace and a solution for the #basque conflict, that is so #european like the conflict of *Irlanda of the North.
And neither it is necessary to forget, of course, the component *represivo and in this field the Commissioner commissioned of the relative subjects to the *tercer *pilar, is to say, the of the politics of interior, goes to offer the plans and programs already existent to sensitise to the strengths of the order and the justice on this anti-doping fight.
Gentleman *Napolitano, wanted to *tranquilizarle also regarding the proposal to carry out some preparatory works of accompaniment, and insist in the word accompaniment, since with regard to the subject of the review of the Treaties exist technical looks very precise and specific, #can not be accused of have not posed a deep vision, a complete analysis of these looks.
(To5-0071/1999) of the Mr. *Morillon, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the actions directed to reach the economic and social development of *Turquía (*COM(1998) 600 - *C4-0670/1998 - 1998/0300(*COD));
The *Viceprimer #turkish Minister *Bahceli, of the *MHP, declared on purpose of the ratification of the conviction of death of *Ocalan -perhaps #this only publishes  in the #german press- that did not have to  encourage a still greater interference of *Europa in the #turkish subjects and the President *Ecevit manifested that it was not forced to accept a possible decision of the Court of *Estrasburgo.
Enough significantly, the calls of the speaker and other colleagues, that have presented amendments directed to *Turquía to end to look for finally the true path and hardly *transitable to a democratic State of Right, coincide with our objections of principle concerning the confirmation of the character of candidate to *Ankara Why did not plays clean now the European Union?
Outraged by the ratification of the conviction to pity of death of the president *Ocalan and joined to the hour to ask a gesture to the #turkish Government, the moratorium of the conviction to pity of death, is #likely that suspend  the sentence, in spite of the grave decision of the Government of not answering to the appeal of the Court of *Estrasburgo.
The *segunda managerial derivative in the frame of the improvement of the quality of the air acclimatise in *Europa also has to fulfil, obviously, the same that the previous directives, the following goals, to know: the definition and concretion to scale #european of goals in matter of quality of the air acclimatise and the establishment of criteria of evaluation of the quality of the air based in uniform methods.
In relation with the already signed agreements, or that are arguing , on decrease of the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon of the tourisms, the Commission has signalled in reiterated opportunities that goes to consider the possibility to dictate norms on maximum values for these broadcasts #if the car industry did not fulfils with his commitments.
. (IN) Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin wanted to express my gratitude to the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development and, of course, to his speaker, the Mr. *Pesälä, for having focused with a so positive disposition the proposal of the Commission, and the Commission appreciates the fine received that has had his proposal.
We are not, therefore, in front of a debate #any one but in front of #one that affects to #one of the four *pilares of the politics *pesquera community, and #would wish that said debate was so fruitful and responsible like the that have had in the Commission of Fishing, since the report, #whose approval request, has been the fruit of a very worked commitment among the political Groups and the distinct sectorial interests and national.
#One of the most remarkable things about the fishing is that, whereas the fishermen have seen  in difficulties and the places of work have reduced , the consumer has found  with that in *Europa the price of the fish, almost only like alimentary product, has increased without ceasing through the years.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0085/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market on the proposal of decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Decision of 19 December 1996 by the that adopts  a program of action for the customs in the Community "Customs 2000" ) and that revokes the Decision 91/341/*CEE (9601/1/1999 - *C5-0183/1999-1998/0314(*COD))
True that follows posed the problem of the sinister become in third countries. I entrust in that it achieve  find a solution respecting the approach of the Parliament that wants to expand the field of application of the directive to these cases and, to #the same time, leaving to except the worries of the Council with a view to the respect of the principles of the international Right deprived.
It wanted simply check #if there will be an opportunity to examine this question another day of this week, because #one of the things that have not examined  in this Parliament is the paper that the industries of armament are exerting in the process of peace of *Irlanda of the North.
The Presidency asks that the juridical departments of the Commission and of the Council inform in squad, still during the course of this week, on the points of sight juridical of the question. The Commission has right of initiative in this subject and the Council adopts the definite decision.
To be able to fund these additional needs during the next years and no *rebasar, especially, the general frame agreed in *Berlín for the next years, maybe was necessary a modification, a review of the financial perspectives; like this it demands it precisely the incorporation of new priorities without leaving to keep the budgetary discipline.
Subject: Action of the EU against the traffic of material *ABQ In spite of the grave indications of traffic of appropriate materials for the construction of arms atomic, bacteriological and chemical (*ABQ), do not undertake  substantial initiatives to combat the problem, whereas the celebrated debates to the *respecto by the most diverse parts and the agreements of control of materials *ABQ reveal  insufficient.
My Group supported his strategy, that pretended to situate to the Council in front of his responsibilities: or well we achieved the financial means that allowed to respect our political commitments, or well resorted to the article 272 of the Treaty, that *nos authorises to determine *nosotros same -undoubtedly inside some strict limits- the no compulsory costs.
In the frame of the program of action on the climatic change, that announced to this Assembly in October, the work of the Commission centres  at present in the creation of a list of measures *prioritarias in the field of the climatic change that it will be presented to the Council of Environment in March.
Now well, objectively talking -#can say from the perspective of the one who observes the battle from a flat second- is true that has progressed  in the deliberation about the designation of the groups of work. But on the other hand, it has not reached  it advance #any in the main field, that is the of the problem of the rights of broadcast and the broadcasts in himself/hisself.
In the resolution signal  #a lot of steps that #can conduct to take reality the protocol of *Kioto #if *Europa assumed the *lierazgo: reduction of the broadcasts in the national field, concrete plans for the reduction of the broadcasts in the main sectors, especially in the industrial, in the that the broadcasts increase more quickly, adoption of measures of economic character, fast ratification of the protocol of *Kioto and intensification of the dialogue among *Japón and the countries in roads of development.
The European Union considers very important that in *Macao apply  entirely the Treaty of the UN on the economic rights, social and *educacionales and the Treaty on the civic rights and politicians, #as well as the basic labour norms ratified by the general treaties of the World-wide Organisation of the Work.
And it same it is necessary to say also regarding the principle of autonomy and to the current economic systems and social of *Macao, #as well as, in a wider plane, to the relations of the European Union with that zone of the Extreme Orient, since the experience encloses *virtualidades that they #can be of extraordinary importance in this part of the world.
For *eso, in particular in name of my Group of the Green/Free Alliance European, and *sumándonos to the conjoint resolution, want to underline the need that  *salvaguarde the autonomy of *Macao consolidating his civil society and the democracy with freedom of political association, keeping opened the Union to the inhabitants of the territory and strengthening the commercial relations by means of *él.
In the durable signals that fits to underline in this moment of transition is the absolute singularity of *Macao, the open cultural tolerance among villages and cultures, the religious freedom, strokes of specific #symbiosis and a juridical culture *moldeada with the principles and values of the State of right and the human rights.
The Council has accepted, equally, introduce a clause of review tied to the financial consequences of the adhesion of new States members, that will allow to define the repercussions from the point of sight financial of the enlargement in the frame of the *codecisión, since the Parliament has voice and vote in a strict foot of equality with the Council.
*Europa Had not had to begin for demanding a restructuring of the organisation and of his operation, #as well as a clearer delimitation of his field of competitions -inside the respect of the other organisms and international conventions-, in particular in relation with the environment and the social rights?
The Council has offered his support to the Ambassador *Eagleton, that is the special representative in the *Sáhara Western of the General Secretary of the UN, and the Council is had to boost a peaceful solution that base  in a deep examination of the next report of the UN.
Subject: Action of the EU against the traffic of material *ABQ In spite of the grave indications of traffic of appropriate materials for the construction of arms atomic, bacteriological and chemical (*ABQ), do not undertake  substantial initiatives to combat the problem, whereas the celebrated debates to the *respecto by the most diverse parts and the agreements of control of materials *ABQ reveal  insufficient.
In this sense, *cuando the question includes also the look of how takes the European Union regarding the countries candidates to the adhesion *cuando in his territory  *trafica with these materials, or conceal  #such practices, it that poses precisely is how political commitment or how political commitments goes  to impose to these countries so that they advance his processes of adhesion.
It wanted to know #if *usted approves this behaviour of the Council that *supedita the approval of the procedure simplified in the frame of the *codecisión to the condition that the Parliament do not take to cost his right to modify the proposal that the Commission presents to the Council, all *ello to conclude that #if we decide to exert our right *nos exclude of the procedure of *codecisión.
Neither we #can accept the argument adduced by the Commission that the delay in the presentation of his proposal has to  to that the Court of Justice of the European Communities still has not pronounced  on the demand presented against the Council regarding the juridical foundation of the Regulation 820/97.
In Indonesian #ours experience has shown that in the diet of the *Orde *Baru (New Order), headed by *Suharto and his generals, that occupied my homeland during more of two decades, the methodology of repression and suppression were applied by means of the *imposición of a doctrine, the *Pancasila, that *uniformizaba the thought and, in consequence, the human action, in an attempt to destroy the capacity to think of individual form, collective and especially free.
Thus, the #christian democrats, that always have defended the road of the dialogue and the reconciliation, want to reiterate #ours more forceful conviction of the acts of violence and the attempts against the human rights that follow *perpetrándose and *deplorar the delay in the development of the process of peace.
The European Parliament, always sensitive to the cause of the human rights, #can not remain *impasible in front of it that it is the greater of the violations of these rights: the systematic discriminations and the violence that the woman is object today in *Afganistán and of the that the public execution of *Zaarmeena is not more that a tragic sample.
The #nicaraguan village, after having suffered *tantas natural catastrophes, needs help urgently, but a cooperation of the European Union with the Government of *Nicaragua only is possible #if they respect  the basic norms of the democracy and the human rights and #if the administration of bottoms is guaranteed in accordance with the laws.
The only logical sense of this article, thanks to the *addenda taken by the Council of *Amsterdam, is the to consider to #all the insular regions of the Union among the less favoured regions owing to his *handicap geographic, source of the increase of the costs, for example, in the sectors of transport or of the energy.
Finally and already concluding, Gentleman President, have curiosity for knowing the posture of the Commission in front of the amendment 9ª relative to the professional secret of the juridical advisers, #as well as the posture that will adopt the Commission in front of the sector of distribution of cars *cuando expire the regulation of exemption by category for this sector in the year 2002.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, is *loable, of course, that the Commission, and especially his competent Commissioner, the Mr. Go *Miert -that is not among *nosotros, but to the that want to say, anyway, that #can not  manifestly *reprocharle that it have lost the control of his administration- watch by the ideal application of the Treaty to avert #all distortion of the competition in the Only Market.
Perhaps it #would be timely that the Presidency sent a note to the different national Governments, #as well as to the different national parliaments to end to signal this possible difficulty, is to say, a disequilibrium among the decisions of the European Parliament and the eventual decisions on the incompatibility that #can be distinct of the that *nosotros have taken.
Unfortunately, *me see forced to *dirigirme to determined sectors of this Parliament with a last question. How they think to defend the rights of his constituents *cuando decide  to remove leadership to the fundamental right of request, suppressing the corresponding commission, or *cuando pretend to modify the name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens substituting it by Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of the Consumers?
The right of request is a very important conquest in the field of the political rights of the citizens and *me seems useful to remember once again, to the equal that the speaker, that this right has found his full recognition in the Treaty of the European Union.
The own *condescendencia of the speaker, when proposing the extension of the term of application of the computerisation of the diet of traffic until 30 June of the year 2003, the system *TRANSIT, is *algo that reflects very negatively the assessment of the up to now obtained results to #that *respecto.
The explosion of the commercial exchanges that goes to know the world in the next years do not pities  with these delays under pity to prejudice gravely the treasures of the Union, *expoliados in important measure of his own resources more important: the rights *aduaneros, the rights *niveladores agricultural.
The most important task of the EU in these moments is to formulate a political solution, detain the ethnic cleansing, help to the refugees, put end to the bath of blood and undertake the necessary actions to allow the return of these refugees.
In effect, as they signal it, for example, the organisations of consumers, the valid #european legislation in this field *privilegia the offer, whereas the dimension of the demand to the service of the interests of the consumers and of the small companies occupies a little important place.
Gentleman President, after expressing my *condolencia by the victims of the accident and my emotion by the value of the squads of rescue, wanted to *detenerme in a point that complements it manifested by the Mr. *Florio and that wakes up the worries of the local entities and of the economic operators of the regions of *Saboya and of the Valley of *Aosta.
Gentleman President, #one of the most #sad things that have seen in these last times has been the image of the children of *Rosemary #Nelson that accompanied his coffin to the grave the past month, after the brutal murder that it was victim this defender of the human rights in *Irlanda of the North.
In the current context, #would wish to take upsetting in the fact that the staff of the #european public administration, that very watched results relatively scarce -*me refer specifically to the Commission-, has not followed the exponential curve of the tasks that *le have been entrusted from the fall of the Wall of *Berlín.
In #the same order of ideas, sustain the idea of the Defender of the Village in the sense to suggest that the Treaty *CE mention explicitly the roads that they have the particular to present resources, #as well as the possibilities to present claims to the Defenders of the national Village.
Have reason in highlighting that the persons of age have of a big *acervo of experience, wisdom, training and values to the that #can not renounce; that it is necessary a general reflection on determined expectations of role and traditional attitudes; that it has to produce a social change of mentality with the goal to struggle against the multiple discriminations and social exclusions that suffer the greater persons inside and out of the labour field.
In the report signals  the significance of the continuous training: in accordance with the proposal of the Commission, is precise to loan more attention to the needs of the most greater workers in the frame of the training along #all the life, that represents to his time an element of the strategy in matter of employment.
Wail, finally that the *autocensura that has chaired this report -has been by own will, perhaps #can not  have taken of another form- have carried to the speaker to limit his work to questions basically technical and, often, of *relumbrón, without tackling the true questions of bottom, of political nature, that pose  to our economies and that it will be necessary to tackle a day in front of our villages.
The abuse of the money of the citizens of the Union damages the image of the Community, the headlines of press on the subject weaken the support of the population to the integration and plant the hits of the Union in the last plane.
#This is the suggestion that wanted to that this Parliament approved, although to #the same time wanted to encourage the studies that are making so that it was a concrete proposal and so that the new financial perspectives and the new budget contain a *PM, a precise reference to this complementary weapon for our common commercial politics.
The goal in this case is not the of *ultimar a project that always is evolving, but contribute to clear for the citizens #all the sense of the complex of documents that have produced in form of Treaties, the priorities that have for the Union and the limits, because, of course, #some are concerned also by the excesses of the Union.
*Usted Has referred  to the euro and *le want to remember -although *usted is economist and #this #can not but *sonarle to *algo fed up known- that, #if before carrying out a common monetary politics had had the capacity to make a political economy or an economic politics, probably today the euro #would not find  in inferiority of conditions with regard to the dollar, conditions that register  in the markets of #everyone.
I receive with particular *beneplácito the request of the speaker so that it concede  priority to the #SME, reinforce  the activities of investigation and innovation and boost  the environmental protection, the participation of the tertiary sector, the improvements of the education and the training and the disappearance of the social exclusion.
We expect with interest the debates in the Council of Subjects General, foreseen for the end of this month, with seen to add some elements of these great projects directed to take a substantial contribution to a more durable stability in the *Balcanes Western in the next century.
We have acted late and badly, and the question that, today,  *nos poses -said it the Mr. *Dupuis with other words- is that we have to *darnos explains that it has got the moment of an initiative of information massive, to bomb with information to the #serbian village, so that also the #serbian village #can say that *nosotros have the reason and the strength, *nosotros and no *Milosevic.
#If like this it was the case, the members of the Council #would have to receive #the same wage, and also the members of the embassies of the community countries and even the experts without taking into account #if they represent to an agricultural organisation of a rich country or of a poor country.
I give to *ello #a lot of importance because we treat the report on the application of *gravámenes for the utilisation of roads, because the European Court of Justice has declared invalid the first managerial by legal failures, or was by the fault of participation by part of the Parliament, and has kept his effects only until there #be a new decision.
But here it has reached  a consensus with Swiss that the open, that the adheres to the #european integration, also regarding the politics of transport, but to #the same time leaves  clear, that the principles of a politics of transport that protect to the environment takes  viable with the introduction of the *viñeta #european, with the deviation of the transport by road to the transport by railway.
Under this point of sight *me cheers that the corresponding commission also have got to the conclusion to refuse the inclusion of a term of reflection, that in my opinion is a *disparate so much juridical like practical, and instead of *ello have introduced a general right of *revocación.
It is true that the globalisation of the markets and the diffusion of the new technologies of treatment of the communication and of the information have unchained economic and social changes that are revolutionising the way in that the markets serve to the consumers, to the time that these changes have transformed the expectations of #this.
To define a food like allocated to the special feeding, has to fulfil some specific nutritional needs for some categories of persons, that #can not *ingerir common foods, well because have digestive problems or of metabolism well because by his physiological state *les results especially beneficial the consumption controlled of some substances that find  in the foods.
Equally, the possibility to invite to *reflexionar to the European Parliament before refusing definitively a proposal has left to be necessary given the possibility to begin the political debate among the political groups and the institutions in the first reading.
Third: the set up of the euro, in the that have taken part of active and constructive mood, taking care that the step to the new coin did not take  to coast of the consumers, watching by that the new directors of the Central Bank European had the preparation and necessary independence, and obtaining for the Parliament of #all the Europeans a suitable information in matter of monetary politics.
In any case, will observe very attentively the result of the summit and will see how makes  the division of tasks among the national States and the #european level regarding the politics of employment, so that it do not arise an erroneous impression of #european responsibility in the erroneous place.
Here it includes  a solid financial frame until the 2006, substantial reforms of the Common Agricultural Politics and of the structural politics #as well as modifications of the resolution on own resources that have more in account the financial capacity of the States members and contribute to a juster distribution of the charges.
It was decided to vote in favour of the investiture of the Mr. *Prodi like President of the Commission, satisfied so much of the rapidity as of the efficiency with the that the Council took the decision #as well as of the #european height of a man that had directed, with *brío and knowledges, a #italian government of lefts in some difficult conditions conducting to #Italia to the *UEM.
I believe that it is forced in this moment take a brief reminder of the *emplazamiento and of the historical mission that supposes the enlargement, no only in the Diary 2000 but also for the European Union, in the measure in that the villages of the *Europa central and oriental and also of the Mediterranean, the greater part of the *cuales have *recobrado the freedom do not takes a lot, want to associate to our collective historical adventure.
For example: *domeñar the until then *desaforado growth of the agricultural cost; consolidate and develop the politics of cohesion, fundamental for the economic convergence and for the political solidarity; integrate in the community budget events like the #german reunification; open a *brecha in the competitions of the Council in the field of the compulsory costs.
This suspension in fact of the agreements on the free circulation of citizens *reviste a gravity that, definitely, no  *le escapes, nevertheless, his prudence in matter of competitions among the Institutions -that #can comprise- no *le exempts to give a political answer: The European Union #can accept that 3.000 citizens are retained with police pretexts with the end of *impedirles exert his right plenaries of #european citizens?
#If it #can not  show that these more rigorous norms are justified, will consider  a technical commercial fetter and now says  on purpose in the new environmental guarantee that #if it #can show that the most rigorous norm that a country want to adopt *redunda in fact in benefit of the consumers, the EU will have to assume the normative group.
Since it applies  from finals of 1996 the program «oil by foods», the States members of the European Union have had the presidency in the commission of sanctions against *Iraq of the Council of Security and always have pronounced  in favour of a flexible application and a continuous improvement of the program.
With his active participation in the debates in the previous stage to the elections, the #algerian citizens have shown the big importance that concede to a transparent electoral process and pluralist, #such as they have announced the #algerian authorities. They had promised some elections like this.
In the last *comprobación relative to the conditions of 9 November 1998, the Council got to the conclusion that *Croacia has to follow perceiving autonomous commercial preferences but that still have not fulfilled  the conditions for the help of the program *PHARE and that the negotiations on an Agreement of Trade and Cooperation #would be still too much precipitated.
First, in the agriculture, for keeping the community character of the agricultural politics, in spite of the intense pressure that exerted  to approve measures of *cofinanciación.-Second, by the structural actions, is to say, by that keep  a greater help *per *cápita of the structural Bottoms and of the Bottom of Cohesion for the countries of the cohesion.
Gentleman President, *yo #would say that the main merit of the Commission of Fishing consisted, takes a year, in presenting the proposals of the Diary 2000, diagnose quickly the grave failures that there was in the proposals on structural politics *pesquera and, immediately, elaborate a strategy that was defended seriously by #all the speakers of opinion, #as well as, of course, by the Mr. *Arias *Cañete, speaker for the bottom.
In the first place, no only we have guaranteed that they go  to tackle directly -for the first time- the poverty and the abandonment in the urban zones, but that also, and against of #all the expectations, have achieved to keep an urban initiative in the community plane oriented to the small and average cities that, in the actuality, benefit  of less of the 10 % of the bottoms.
The reduction of the prices of intervention for the meat of *vacuno and of the cereals #can not avert but in spite of *ello it is necessary to give the graces, among #others to the influence of the European Parliament, by that the reduction have not reached the intensity that the Commission proposed initially.
The promise of a full compensation by the cuts of prices of 1992 has not fulfilled  in the relative decisions to the Diary 2000, with it that the agriculturalists suffer enormously the reduction of prices at the same time that continue increasing the costs of the Common Agricultural Politics.
Gentleman President, also to me *me #would enjoy to express my more cordial gratitude to the speaker -to the one who have seen to assume in numerous occasions the responsibility in matter of health and security-, to *usted, gentleman Commissioner, and to his services for speeding up a big part of the necessary legislation in this field, #as well as by his assistance, so much official as officious, to the hour to help to the Parliament to comprise it that #can  and it that #can not  take.
When being today our last day of work, invite to our President, Mr. #Gil-Oaks, #as well as to the president of the Commission of Subjects External, Security and Political of Defence, to that they consider the opportunity to send immediately, in the next days, to a small delegation of the European Parliament so that it gather  with the Mr. *Rugova in Blunt, #where finds , because I do not know how *sucederá inside a month, month and half or two months.
How we will be able to explain that this Parliament has not had in any moment the opportunity to exert his right to issue a *dictamen, that to date no *nos has got any documentation detailed about this subject and that the Parliament sees  forced to treat this subject without having of the necessary information?
As they have underlined it the majority of the orators of my Group, believe that it do not has to , to protect to the consumer -worry that do not leaves to be legitimate-, deprive it, to #the same time, of #all the advantages and of #all the benefits that this development #can contribute so much in the plane of the employment as in the of the economy.
It is the case of the amendments directed to restrict the exceptions enumerated in the Annex 2 of the proposal (amendments *núms. 21, 68 and 74) and of the amendment 61, relative to the demands in the courts, although on this last subject the Commission recognises that it is necessary to improve the possibilities of repair legal, especially in the agreements *transfronterizos.
#A lot of graces, gentleman *Mendes Bounces, am sure that #all *nosotros wish also can celebrate in September it that *usted has signalled in the last part of his intervention and, as *usted has announced that #this goes to be the last in this hemicycle, *permítame that *le wish it better for the future and that wish also that we follow keeping a fine relation so that, are #where are, #can cooperate so much in the fight for culminating the process of the European Union as in the solidarity with #all the villages that the need.
In this sense, the Commission considers that the approval, by part of the President *Habibie of Indonesian, of the presence of observers of the Nations Joined, that go to supervise the query organised by the #indonesian authorities in *Timor Oriental, constitutes a step to forward, and entrusts in that this presence guarantee the that this announcement celebrate  in a peaceful climate, of impartiality, of freedom and of security.
And, therefore, *me seems that it #would be necessary to take an important call, in particular that the countries, and mainly the States members and the great countries, ratified the statute and renounced explicitly to the clause of exclusion concerning the crimes of war so that  *instituya like this a true judicial instance, compulsory, thanks to the *cual #can legitimate  a right of interference.
And regarding the ratification of the Statute of the International Penal Court create, of course, that *ustedes have signalled a point of sense common: what before begin to work this Court, easier will be to tackle and begin to resolve problems like the of the *Balcanes -for quoting the case of more actuality, *Kosovo- and #others that there #be in the world.
We have reached this result because, in the conciliation, #can *esgrimir in front of the delegation of the Council the decisions of the Council *ECOFIN of 18 January 1999, the *cuales ascertain -irony of the destination- that the current system *INTRASTAT contains more variable of the necessary, that had to simplify, that it #would be necessary to limit the costs and modify the regulations of 1991.
Our gratitude also to #some that do not see #all the days, but of the that have a daily reflection: the that elaborate the *Info-Session , the document that informs in brief of the session, and that have the virtue that, in an inscrutable jungle as it is the quantity of things that treat in the Plenary, know to choose the species and the tree that corresponds to each moment.
The importance of the European Union like international actor has remained patent also in the numerous conferences *interregionales, in the Latin American Summit of River, in the Conference of the Mediterranean of *Stuttgart -a platform that now #can purchase a very considerable significance in the context of a possible new dynamics of peace-, in the *ASEM celebrated in *Berlín and in #many other meetings.
In this context #would have to leave sideways a strictly juridical interpretation and understand rather under the term Constitution a compilation of the values and the fundamental principles, of the mechanisms of operation of the #european coexistence, included the operation of the European Union like political construction *sui *generis .
Now we know that #one of the persons proposed by the Federal Government German not even had the opportunity to gather  with the Federal Chancellor before #this interviewed  with the Mr. *Prodi. Or it was, that the Federal Chancellor had not kept any previous conversation with the person that proposed.
The *burdo blockade of the #european directive on the old cars in exclusive interest of a car consortium German resulted so outrageous like the designation by surprise of the #ex Minister of the Chancellery *Hombach like Representative in the *Balcanes or the fault of understanding of the goals and the forms of the #french politics.
To the one who today celebrates like a big hit the Pact of stability for the *Sureste #european, more *le #would have cost no *despilfarrar the money in bombs, missiles and soldiers, and present instead a pair of months before said pact, like part of a political project and wide civilian of the European Union for the region, and endow to the *OSCE of the necessary resources.
Varied subjects of actuality, #such as the #nordic dimension of the Union and the relations with *Rusia, will be treated then with #all security, but wanted to still take out to *relucir another question of actuality: the expectations to carry to good term the process of peace of Orient Next are the best of the last *añostras the rise to the power of the government of #Barak.
Yes, it results *chocante that a #european Commissioner #can obtain *indebidamente personal advantages of his functions. But much more *chocante still is that great very rich companies #can obtain private benefit, of form totally legal, of the subventions of the #european institutions, *cuando results that these same institutions in at all help -that *yo know- to the eighteen millions of workers reduced to the unemployment in the territory of the Union, as neither to #that other millions that have to live with wages that grieve *les allow to survive.
*Nos Abstained in the vote of this point, since the proposal of statute of the European Parliament is not #satisfactoria.3.el relative point to the next governmental conference, as we think that the conference only has to treat the enlargement and not to see complicated by the question of the extensive reforms for taking.
In general, the opening of a credible #european perspective and realistic #whose final goal was the adhesion to the EU with responsibility and #ours help, is besides the only solution for the stabilisation *substantiva and for the creative development of the relations among #all the #balkan countries, and among *ellos and the rest of *Europa and of the world.
The Commission of Subjects Constitutional requests that it integrate  to the section 1 of the article 29 of our Regulation the following interpretation: "it #can not admit with arrangement to this article the constitution of a group that denies openly all political character and #all political affinity among his components" .
Definitely, with a critical content, that shows, once again, it that always have checked whereas Commissioner and that I want to declare in front of this hemicycle: the human and professional quality and the integrity of the women and of the men that are part of the #european public function and that no only loan to *ella his work, but also his personal delivery.
Our Group, after having listened the repeated statements taken in front of the Parliament by the President designated, after having voted his investiture in May and after having taken part with seriousness and without prejudices in front of #any of the 19 candidates to Commissioners, considers that the long crisis that has affected to the Commission has to finalise with a clear and strong investiture of *usted, gentleman President, and of the Commission proposed by *usted, in virtue of the powers that *le awards the Treaty.
The Greens propose a series of measures relative to the active reduction, global and massive of the time of work, and the support to durable economic activities, creators of employments, in sectors like the construction of houses, the collective transports, the renewable energies.
No thus it leaves to be dangerous, as the groups of pressure federalistic go to *apropiarse the conclusion of Colony to try start the defence of the rights of the citizens to the national constitutions and for *englobarlas in an upper text, a supposed #european constitution.
Lady Speaker, President of the Commission, the year 1999 has been difficult for the main institutions of the European Union because the problems that have arisen in relation with questions like the surrender of accounts about varied initiatives of the Union, have created tensions in the relations among the European Parliament and the Commission.
The Roman Mr. *Prodi was proposed like President of the Commission by the current Government of the Italian Republic, of the *cual my party is active part and entrusted in that the strength of his personality #can guarantee a valid leadership of the Commission and surpass the limits and the incongruences that exist in his program and in his composition.
But it is fundamental to recognise that Indonesian did not fulfil with the commitments contracted in the Agreement of New *York, that demanded the intervention of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined by means of the sending of a strength of peace, with precise mandate and length determined, to guarantee the security and the peace in the territory and avert a new genocide.
Gentleman President, is not with spirit of barren recrimination but by our interests and by our alarm in front of the form in that it is evolving the situation by it that *nos feel forced to remember and *recalcar the direct and indirect responsibility of the States Joined of *América by the slaughterings and the ethnic purification, that in these moments characterise to the situation in *Timor oriental.
Along the years the Realm Joined has achieved to have a high and effective military capacity and in spite of *ello the strengths armed of the Realm Joined are now excessively scattered and the greater part of the States members of the European Union consecrate to the defence a proportion of his inferior #GDP to the of the Realm Joined.
The Humanitarian Office of the European Union (THROW) has taken part from the principle in the estimate of the thickness of the necessary help and in the coordination of the cast of the help of the Union to the most needed places.
*Yo Think that from the moment in that it exists the European Union, from the moment in that there #be freedom of circulation, from the moment in that it exists the agreement of *Schengen and exists a unit in the subject of the circulation of persons among the countries members, #can not a *tercer country, the States Joined, come to *quebrantar this politics and discriminate to a country like #Grecia.
At present the priorities are to put in order the banking system, collaborate closely with #others *pilares and with the *KFOR to provide the basic supplies, accommodation and transport of face to the winter, prepare together with the World-wide Bank and the #FMI a budget simplified and work in fiscal subjects, #as well as elaborate together with the World-wide Bank a frame for the investment to half term that will be presented in the next conference of future donors.
Likewise, I believe that these 15 representatives of the States members work in this council of administration in accordance with a swearing of the charge that *les forces to back and boost, *cuando was possible, the interests of his country, and no on the base of a #european swearing of the charge that #can demand that they respected  to the maximum the ideas and #european interests and no only the national.
The European Union and in particular the European Parliament have not left to express his unconditional support to the attempts to promote the process of peace in Orient Half and to provide help to this region.
In the resolution of the month of March of 1999, relative to the process of peace and to the future help to Orient Half, the European Parliament has underlined precisely that, although they confirm  the agreements of *Wye *Plantation, as like this it has been, the most important problems, especially the statute of the refugees, have to resolve.
A last question. Even highlighting the need to follow conceding humanitarian help to *través of the *OOPS, believe that the European Parliament is especially interested in finding a just political solution and objective to the problem of the #palestinian refugees, a solution that was according to the resolution 194 of the Nations Joined.
The waves of refugees, in increase, do not solve  reinforcing the measures *represivas, but exerting an international politics that reduce the tensions and contribute to the political solution *pacificadora of any type of difference, and that do not resort, as in the case of *Kosovo, to the criminal measures of a military intervention.
Reinforce the activities of exchange of informations, of filed, and of preparation of these informations, well in the field of the *Europol, well directly among the States members, increases the dangers of an uncontrolled use of these archives and legalises #all activity of surveillance and of police signing, with the excuse to warn the criminal acts.
I quote: "in so much in they will go it prevail the opinion to define to the that think of another way like the that have another belief and that the right to decide on the life and the death or to control the destination of the country derives of the religion, the political climate will remain poisoned and it will be necessary to have that it produce  violence by political reasons" .
In consequence, the Union supports the forensic investigations on the presumptive crimes of war and, this same week, the Council of Subjects General has expressed in his conclusions his deep worry by the fact that it follow without resolving  the question of the varied thousands of missing; in his big majority *albanokosovares.
The Commission receives with satisfaction the positive will of progress that showed the Government in the opposition in the agreement mark, but is necessary to follow advancing substantially - as for example, with the celebration of some just legislative elections, foreseen for the next year - before being able to *plantearnos the possibility to restart a regular cooperation.
At any rate I believe that it #would be necessary to follow working to treat to look for the possibility that there was an independence among the deputy and the assistant, since our work requires this independence, in the conversations, in the subjects to treat and even in other factors that do not come to the case.
Lady Speaker, of compliance with the article 41 of the Regulation, formulated a question for the turn of questions and fulfilled the terms that in the point 13 of the section To of the Annex *II, foresee that "the questions will have to present to the President a week before, like minimum, of the beginning of the turn of questions.
After the statements of the President *Prodi in front of the European Parliament, the Commission proceeds to an analysis in depth of the situation created by the multiplication of the cases of doping in the sport and considers the possibility to set up concrete measures that it #would be possible to adopt in the community field.
I have suggested to use the commercial television in commercial time and, is more, have asked #if the Commission #would be had to choose the space of #time among the general #news and the sportive #news, because in #such case the wide popular coats #would not be taking zapping.
Gentleman Commissioner, there #be not worse attitude that try close ahead of time an investigation of the type of the investigation on the linen, on the implication of high charges of the #spanish Government in a plot of collection illicit of subventions and the fraud in these helps for the transformation of the crop.
Finally, it wanted to *recordarle once again that the *FEOGA is investigating varied campaigns in these moments and #if the verifications at random allow to ascertain irregularities in the management of the system of organisation of the markets, *España has to have present that will deduce  a compensation to so much heaved, is to say, that the already disbursed subventions will reduce  *retroactivamente in a global total that will depend of the gravity of the irregularities detected.
It goes to propose the Commission to the European Council more of it same or, by the contrary, the Commission, on the base of the requirement of the criteria of *Copenhague and of the own *convencimiento internal of the Turkish, goes to offer to the Turkish the possibility of not losing the train of the future?
Without embargo, like deputy of #turkish origin support the help and economic cooperation and support also to *Turquía in his inclusion in the European Union #if well they have to  fulfil the conditions of *Helsinki. For example, the question of *Chipre, the of the human rights and the question *kurda have to solve politically, abolish the pity of death and concede a general amnesty to #all the prisoners.
I know that the European Parliament follows of wall the evolution of the process of peace in Orient Next and that, in his breast, exists a deep knowledge of the subjects of the zone, as well it shows the report on the process of peace published by the Parliament in May of the present year.
Lady Speaker, in name of the radical deputies here present and no inscribed, *le confirm that we do not go to take part in the vote until they do not resolve  the problems of the rights and of the prerogatives of #all the elect deputies in this Parliament and while it do not allow  to #all the 626 deputies have #the same rights and #the same duties.
Likewise, they are known the difficulties that find these energies to penetrate the market, #as well as the reasons of this situation: the sources of energy traditional have a relatively low and stable price; the absence of measures #tending to promote the *FER.
Without embargo, in my opinion, exist risks founded that *Europa, in this field of the international trade and in the Round of the #Millenium, adopt positions of *retaguardia and do not assume, instead, as it #would have to, a leadership of civilisation, a leadership that wants to direct the novelty of the 2000 of the international trades in a field of norms reliable for #all.
It is a pity that the Mr. *Pasqua have left ; it said that in this Assembly there #be not debate, but wanted to *remitirle to the results of the economies of Big *Bretaña and the States Joined, countries integrated in the system of trade world-wide that have achieved high indexes of growth, the reduction of the taxes of unemployment and low types of interest.
By #this have to defend also the #european agriculture, the tradition of the typical products that *engloban the textile sector, of the footwear and of the industry, remembering that the elimination of some products comports the modification of habits or even of the surroundings: we think in the oil, the *lúpulo and the malt.
I believe that our deliberations of today have turned in fine measure around the key subjects of the environment and the agriculture and also to the subject of the social clause, but want to call his attention on the specific needs of the industry of the culture and of the audiovisual sector.
By this reason the Council approved on 28 June 1999, in accordance with the procedure of *codecisión with the European Parliament, a common position to take the decision to create an only instrument for the finance and planning of programs oriented to the cultural collaboration.
Gentleman President, consider very significant that in the debate on the budget have approved , for now in the breast of the commission, some amendments that back and ask to the Commission that support the campaigns and the actions in favour of the moratorium of the capital executions and, on a long-term basis, the suppression of the pity of death.
By a part, the great world-wide powers -#EE.UU and the *URSS - found  near of the diplomatic split and, by #another, assisted  to the progressive deterioration of the relations among the Atlantic Alliance and #some #islamic countries, in the first place Libyan, whereas in #Italia, in particular the extreme left did not leave to question the #italian participation in the NATO.
Therefore, lady Speaker, consider that it is necessary to subject to the deputies to a system of control internal rigorous -am the first in saying it-, but do not believe that the text that will govern the application of this control have to tread, simply, of the decision applicable type to the group of the personnel of the community administrations.
Now well, in this moment are adopting  #a lot of to scale #european decisions that do not appear reflected directly in the Budget of the European Union, but the Budget 2000 follow being, even so, a foundation determinant and that marks the guideline for the performance in #a lot of fields of the #european politics during the next year.
We begin to *atisbar the amount of the needs for the *Kosovo, there #be had an earthquake in *Turquía and a political cataclysm in *Timor Oriental, without having the need to endow the Agreements of fishing with *Marruecos, that the Government of the main country interested had to to forget in the negotiation on the piano of *Berlín.
To #the same time, *me surprises that *Finlandia, that at present occupies the Presidency, follow so strictly the mistaken opinion of the Council, according to the *cual the world-wide events will not have any influence in the evolution of the budgetary process neither in the total amount of the budget of the EU.
In fact, the transfer of a basic competition of the modern State, the monetary politics, to a truly #european and independent organisation like the #ECB has to consider like a historical event that marks a grade without precedents of political and economic integration inside the European Union.
*Déjenme Finalise insisting in it that it is the specific posture of the Liberal Group, that demands, happened the transitory period of two years, the publication of the votes, of the diverse positions in the meetings of the Executive Committee and of the models *macroeconómicos, that understand that it #would allow to take some forecasts more *convincentes and correct precisely by part of #that that operate in relation with the Central Bank European.
We coincide, likewise, in the measures proposed for the increase of the transparency and in the need of *clarificar how is it that understands  in the Central Bank European by monetary politics, further of the stability of prices -obviously, his main function-, because *ello #would contribute, definitely, to a suitable and balanced *policy *mix that have like goal the promotion of the sustainable development and the durable employment.
But we #would not owe *sorprendernos in front of the limitations of the powers that remain to disposal of the national governments of the zone of the euro put that it never has constituted a secret of the parents founders of the only coin that it that had in mind was the creation of a political union and some states joined of *Europa.
Inside the #dutch tradition exist also #some forms structured of implication of the *Nederlandse *Bank in the economy of consensus, for example with the existence of a council of the bank, that advises to the bank, in the that take part also the social speakers, #as well as because the *Nederlandse *Bank has a seat in the Social Economic Council, that is the *primer organ adviser in the economic and social field.
#If there are not #others that take part, will not work, so that it splits of the answer on it that we have to take now is to be more active in the discussion marry by case -in the frame of the groups of friends of #Sierra Lion, for putting an example- trying organise a more coordinated answer for *alejarnos of the immediate demands of the crisis.
The Commission *subscribe the dynamic perspective of the consecration of a #european concept of access to the justice, like instrument for the exercise of the right of free circulation of the persons without obstacles of legal type and official. Also it is necessary that this right of free circulation go accompanied now of the necessary legislative measures so that it #can take  reality in the shortest space of time.
They agreed  priorities and political orientations and the Commission will have to present a proposal of *scoreboard, group of evaluation of the advances reached and of the fulfillment of the terms established by the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the plan of action of *Viena and the own conclusions of this European Council, pragmatic initiative that *augura fine results and that had the obstinacy of the Commissioner *António *Vitorino, the one who also therefore it deserves our congratulation.
Of this mood, insisted  in the convergence and in common norms in the process of asylum, in the creation -although it wanders- of a financial instrument for situations of temporary protection of refugees, in the intensification of the judicial cooperation, in the recognition of the judicial decisions, etc. The principles are formulated and are as a whole positive.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0034/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position (*C5-0026/99 - 1998/0191 - (*COD)) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a community frame for the electronic signature (Speaker: Mr. *Lechner).
The concomitant announcements of the suppression of 7.500 places of work and of the enormous increase of his benefits, of the closing of the factory *Wolber-*Michelin in *Soissons -described of error of communication by the leaders of the company- show until how point the cynicism and the disdain are the engines of the industrial strategy of this multinational.
"*Le Have taken the funeral" , even said *pomposamente the senator *Jesse #James, known by his extremism, not to giving account - or maybe giving perfect account - that with the signature of this Treaty had begun  to convert in reality the hope of not going back to repeat it that the States Joined took with the nuclear holocaust of *Hiroshima and *Nagasaki.
Gentleman President, the recent decision of the Senate of the States Joined on the rejection of the Treaty of Prohibition Total of Nuclear Proofs creates an unpleasant antecedent in the effort that take the villages of the world by a durable peace and by the stability.
I want to say with #all clarity that the European Union has to modify his politics to the *respecto, that has to pronounce clearly by the human rights of the village *checheno, for which, the *OSCE, the Agreement of armistice of 1996 and also the condition of member of *Rusia in the Council of *Europa offer an instrument to the equal that our Agreement of Cooperation with *Rusia.
It treats  of two different things: while the community organism is oriented to the compilation harmonised and organic of general statistics, pertinent of the distinct States, with the public and the administrations like main customers that, therefore, provide work, the Observatory has objective more specific, more directed and oriented in function of the market and of the statistical needs of the companies and of the professionals.
We owe *circunscribirnos, as, to the current editorial of the article 191 of the Treaty, the ancient article 138 To, that mentions, of way enough wanders, the action of the political parties, quote: "to scale #european", which is very different -anyway, the Council and the Treaty like this wanted it- of the notion of "party political European" *stricto *sensu.
It is also a problem of relation among two countries of a zone of the world that needs peace and tranquility and, therefore, this agreement is strategic no only from the point of sight of these communities *pesqueras, but also from the point of sight of the balance, of the peace, that only #can  reach by means of diverse modalities of cooperation, since it treats  of an exemplary case.
It That the fishermen need to know, in relation with this concrete point, is not that the Commission go to adopt initiatives, is not that the Commission was available for *ayudarlos, it that the fishermen need to know, gentleman Commissioner, is how type of initiatives go  to adopt and, especially, #which is the value of the community subvention that goes  to concede for the help to these fishermen and during how much time is had the Commission to apply it.
Because, as it has said my colleague *Miguélez, the problem of the fishermen is not the to be funded in the inactivity, is the to be supported by the European Union so that they #can exert his professional mission, that is the to be able to work and with *ello contribute to the national wealth and to the community wealth.
Besides, the community presence contributes to the area the elements of a responsible fishing and #can be an important factor of balance in front of the presence of other fleets, mainly the Russian, by not talking of the helps for the programs of investigation scientific that includes this Protocol.
Lady Speaker, wanted to that *nos gave an information, *cuando *usted judge it convenient on a possibility that, to be true, believe that it will be a disaster for the political information of the European Parliament, to know, on the supposition that leave  to publish the bulletin of the Session *Plenaria in #all the tongues of the European Union.
I believe that the debate of the Friday, without the Commission and without the report of the committee of experts, went a positive step because *nosotros have the obligation to generate confidence and give answers to the problems that has the persons; we do not have to *enzarzarnos always in debates among *nosotros that they #can be very interesting but as long as they indicate a line of group.
The combination of the complete realisation of the only market with the only coin, in a context of reforms structural and of strong international competition, will allow to reduce the risks of "neck of bottle" that #can appear in the case that the budgetary politics and *salariales are not suitable.
Of course, it seems indisputable that require  global and coherent strategies to promote the growth and the employment, and *yo *me *congratulo that the own denomination, growth and employment, already dismiss a prejudice propagated often by the left, to know, the idea that it is possible *contraponer growth and employment, the value of the money and the stability of prices and the measures in favour of the employment.
Without embargo, know #a lot of cases of Governments national that have comprised that exists an important *interdependencia among the effects of the monetary politics, financial and *salarial, and that, as in the cases of *Austria, the Low Countries, *Irlanda or *Dinamarca, for example, have extracted the owed consequences, with positive effects for the market of work and for the consolidation of the budgets.
The same that the demand of the Central Bank European in the frame of the dialogue, also have to ask transparency and the direct participation of the European Parliament to the Council of Ministers of Finances, to the Councils "jumbo" , to the Council of Ministers of Social Subjects and to the European Council.
It has to satisfy, of a time for ever, the claim of a labour week of five days, 35 hours, with 7 or 8 hours of work to the day without reduction; but with an increase of the wage, and the cancellation of the regulations that force to the worker of the sea to 12 hours of work to the day in normal conditions.
I recognise that the Mr. *MacCormick has aimed an important data when referring  to the situation of the travelling artists in the #european frame, to the artists that work in different countries, as it #can be the case of the *pianistas or the companies of dance, when referring  to these exponents and producers of the culture.
Like this and #everything, the interpretation of the Regulation #can not be neither of the Table - here quotes  a meeting of the days 22 and 23 November 1979 - neither of the Table to proposal of the President, in accordance with the presidents of the political Groups, according to the decision of the day 19 November 1992.
Each #one of *nosotros has #a lot of unemployed persons among his #Ours voters obligation #would have been to refuse the regrettable idea of the Commission that the unemployed #would have to receive by means of a greater deregulation of the market of work and by means of social impulses stimuluses to interest  by the work or for taking part in the measures of politics of employment.
Like this, as, it is necessary a modification of these politics to end to consider *prioritaria the fixation of goals clear and the materialisation of structures effective for the creation of employments durable and with rights and the consequent important reduction of the unemployment.
*Cuando Affirm that the reduction of the fiscal pressure on the labour cost do not has to engage the *saneamiento of the public finances neither the financial balance of the systems of security, propose a quadrature of the circle that only #can  resolve through a strong economic growth.
In effect, although *me cheer of the decrease of the to scale #european unemployment (9,4% of the active population in 1999 in front of the 10,1% in 1998), the gross reality in figures do not has to in any case mask the difficult economic situation human and social of the most disadvantaged regions of the community territory.
This program, as I have said, will be an important instrument in the fight against the violence to the women, the teenagers and the boys and will serve to sensitise to the society and to the media on the need to help and protect to the victims of the violence.
In the previous term of office, presented in name of the Parliament a report on the protection of the infancy and of the family, in the that requested an important budget for our boys and that created  in the Commission a specific unit, attendant of the protection of the infancy and of the family.
#If embargo, and lo and behold the reason of this oral question, still has not presented a proposal reviewed that it indicate clearly his position with regard to the amendments of the Parliament, neither neither - and have to say it with weighing, since, instead, *nos expected that the #finnish Presidency took in account this problem - has shown the political will to transact this *dossier.
Regarding the possible legislative measures, in this report asks  to the Commission that examine the possibility to modify the valid legislation or introduce new measures that strengthen these goals, but also  *le asks that it check and study the effects of #all the legislative measures adopted up to now and report of his cost and his total efficiency to the Parliament.
The recent nuclear accident had in the *Japón has revealed once again the criminal negligence of the nuclear industry and the recent fake of the verifications of security by part of *BNFL in *Sellafield are a proof more that there #be reason to feel #a lot of worry by the nuclear industry and his operation.
It remains a lot for taking so that the right to the energy was a reality in #all the places, in the poorest countries as in the countries industrialised, #where #all the categories of the population do not have access to the energy in equality of conditions: therefore, they do not satisfy  the needs and the energetic questions purchase crucial importance.
#All have confronted *algún day the dramas and the resultant paradoxes of the absence of freedom of circulation of the sentences that has reflected  in absence of justice for the individuals and self-evident absence and omission of compulsory #european instruments and imperative that, to scale of the common space, *suplieran the incongruences of the juridical fractionation that the national systems produce of course.
The previous orator, the Mrs. *Echerer, already has said that there #be not any "*Containment" neither neither exists a security of service sufficient of the plant even in opinion of the competent #slovakian authority for the security of the nuclear head offices.
The Commission already has carried out a complete study of the eutrophication and the relative problems to the subterranean waters and the States members have indicated the relative problems to the subterranean waters and the vulnerable zones.
It takes a week was convinced that #if it negotiated  arduously existed some hope to reach an agreement that established a just balance among the reasonable protection to the companies and to the agriculture of the EU, on the one hand, and the access to the market for the sakes of the countries in development, by #another.
We have supported #all the efforts directed to reinforce the position of the countries in development in the system of the world-wide trade, without forgetting take upsetting in the indispensable need to continue with the reform of the Common Agricultural Politics of the EU.
It is important in the context of the next round of the structural Bottoms of the EU for 2000-2006 that the measures that include  in the distinct community programs are analysed with the end to guarantee that they adjust  to the national and community legislation in the field of the equality of opportunities.
Now well, from the moment in that it is foreseen that the amounts reduced or suspended happen to charge of the community budget, as very late in the following exercise, this intervention will translate  *obligatoriamente in measures more severe in the course of the following years, with a risk of weakening of the principles of the common agricultural politics.
While it do not surpass  the eagerness of *apropiarse of these sakes, of the resources of the zone -#this also is true in the case of *Europa and of #many other States-, will not cease the conflicts in the region, and also #would owe *reflexionar on the need to find a wide solution of general character on a long-term basis.
A last thing: it tries  include in the negotiations of the Round of the #Millenium *demasiados subjects, *demasiadas appeals of another type, perhaps to save the consciousness, *cuando afterwards -and think in the pity of death- *Europa in his own headquarters, in the UN, do not achieves to form a common front and have the strength to impose #some things.
#Many criticise today to the World-wide Organisation of Trade for having a too much unilateral vision of the trade, for considering it like a goal in himself/hisself same without seeing the complex existent relations among the commercial exchange, the human rights and the respect to the environment.
The field of action and the influence of the *OMC will grow of considerable form in the Ministerial Conference of *Seattle; therefore, the EU #would have to commission that the consequences of the liberalisation of the trade and of the performance of the *OMC are continuously reviewed from the point of sight of the equality and of the environment.
I believe that also the Council -that among our institutions is, in some mood, the that more has  *fragmentado with the multiplication of Councils skilled and a myriad of committees annexes- has to preach with the example, but no only thinking in the future but also thinking in the need to have a democratic and effective community.
#Everything *ello, and with #this finish, gentleman President, results even more necessary to the sight of #that #another big mandate, #whose launching will be the brooch of gold of the #finnish Presidency -the excellent #finnish Presidency, #whose *muchísimos tarpaulins have once again the honour to recognise in this hemicycle and that has supposed a point of inflection in the behaviour of the Council.
Subject: Suitability to fund the programs of the *PNUCD The *PNUCD (International Program of the Nations Joined for the Control of Drugs) has taken publics the data of the annual poll on the production of opium according to the *cuales the total production estimated of gross opium in *Afganistán will have duplicated  with grow this year, happening of the 2100 tonnes of 1998 to the 4600 foreseen of 1999.
It wanted to ask to the Council how form proposes  take take part to the Parliament, *cuando have traced  these roads, in the formulation of this new financial instrument, as it do not fits doubt that it will take fault a new financial instrument, in the measure in that it that exists at present in mood #any is adapted for the current situation of the countries and the territories of *Ultramar and results unsuitable for the aspirations of said countries.
In the first place, I #can say that the colleague Baron *Crespo, to the one who do not consider an accomplice, but, even with #all the political differences, an estimated colleague, has exposed the situation of mood correct, in the measure in that *le communicated of word that *nosotros, the Group of the Popular Party European and the European Democrats want to that it proceed  to vote on the Report *Napolitano.
On my part, I consider - and, I repeat, #this is it that *me has guided in my reflection, but go to ask to the Mr. *Napolitano #if it agrees *conmigo - that the object of the report of the Mr. *Napolitano is the application of a text of character legislative, since it treats  of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, relative to the investigations effected by the *OLAF.
The mandate was and follow being only east, it that it is necessary to decide is only #this: include in our Regulation, or was, in our internal legislation, the Agreement *Interinstitucional so that it #can apply in the field of the Parliament, on the base of a *dictamen of the Commission of Control Budgetary; modify the Regulation introducing the new article 9 *bis and not modifying the Agreement *Interinstitucional.
Gentleman President, the immense majority of my Group is *resueltamente adherent of this report, that consider like #one of the angular stones for the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union concerning the question of the form in that it investigates the complaints of fraud and occupies  of *ellas; probably it do not costs for nothing more, but perhaps it help to show that #many of these complaints *carecen often of foundation, although alas it was not always like this.
We ascertain, second, an inability of coordination substantial, and #this means that the #portuguese Presidency has at all costs that assume the initiative that conduct to the creation of a council *interinstitucional that gather  at least a time to the year to coordinate #all the actions in the interior of the Union, so that *coadyuve to the international coordination.
#If in the #european Summit do not understands  -because we think that the Summit has to occupy directly of the subject- that treats  of the political problem number #one, with enormous consequences for the future; #if it do not understands  that the inability to tackle it *multilateralmente, that is as it has to tackle, has begun has to take increasingly patent, with the subsequent disappointment of our villages, then will not be able to in a prudential time stabilise the situation.
It is true that, in this Parliament, the Court of Accounts do not has good sign, since the President *le has denied a hall of conference of press, *cuando do not exist problems for *acordársela to the most incredible associations, to the personalities of the most doubtful representativeness or to any dog guardian of the only thought, with #such that bark strong.
. (*SV) Want to *puntualizar that the establishment of a system to compare the impressions *dactilares do not constitutes in himself/hisself a guarantee to reach a politics of asylum human and generous, that mean that the States members *solidariamente award to the applicants of asylum right to a shelter.
By it that refers  to the international organisms, have to watch by that the program of repatriation of the *ACNUR continue his activities without that it trip with any gender of difficulty, since there #be had a series of incidents in the last times that seem to indicate that it exists the deliberate intention to procure *desorganizar the program of repatriation of the *ACNUR.
But the fight against the traffic of drug and the bleaching of capitals demands also an action/coordination in the level of the EU (and in the of the Nations Joined) in the fight that has to carry out against the powerful criminal organisations that, with activities and illicit money, *minan the economic and financial system and  *entremezclan with *él.
In the Record of adhesion of *España and *Portugal to the European Communities -in the article 25 and in the Protocol 2 *anejo to said Record- established  for Canarians a special diet characterised by that Canarian was not integrated in the Common Agricultural Politics and, besides, by not being subjected to the Union *Aduanera community, to the diet *arancelario community, neither to the Tax on the Value Added.
There #be had besides another element: already in the Treaty of *Maastricht of 1992 incorporated  a statement recognising the special situation of the regions *ultraperiféricas -Canarian, *Azores, *Madeira and the #french departments of *Ultramar- and the section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty *CE, after his modification by the Treaty of *Amsterdam of 1997, foresees a special diet for the regions *ultraperiféricas.
Therefore, *me #would seem timely that the Commission approved or manifested his agreement with the proposals of the Parliament -of the Commission of Subjects Juridical-, that are very reasonable and agree with the philosophy of the Commission but *reforzándola with the reference to the new article 299.2, that goes to foresee and allow the development of a special diet.
*Yo Do not go to gloss now his political path -*usted finishes it to take very well, lady Speaker-, but yes wanted to leave proof, publicly in front of this Assembly, of his human quality, of his personal value, of his dignity, of the integrity and of the value with that *ella has carried his illness until the last moment.
The inform that in said resolution the President of the Court orders to postpone the execution of the act of the European Parliament of 14 September 1999 by the that the Parliament adopted the interpretation of the article 29 of his Regulation, proposal by the Commission of Subjects Constitutional.
#One of the special subjects in questions of employment under the #finnish Presidency has been the position of the workers of more age, subject that treated  in an unofficial meeting of the Council of Subjects Social and Labour; likewise, also it celebrated  a conference to ministerial level that treated precisely on the equality.
As we promised, in *Helsinki celebrated  a meeting to ministerial level on the #nordic dimension, and although it was not very high the participation of the Ministers of Subjects External of the States members - *yo was the only there -, instead, were present other Ministers and also #all the Ministers of the countries that belong to the field of the called #nordic dimension.
Second, the report do not drops in the cheat to present the human rights like a #european attainment, but that takes it from the universality and handles a world-wide optics, loaning #a lot of attention to the performance of the EU in the frame of the Nations Joined.
We check with bitterness that from the year 1996, year in that the crisis of the sea *Egeo induced the European Community to block the Agreement of union *aduanera with *Turquía, has not given  any step advance to get to the full respect of the civil rights and to the protection of the minorities.
After the conversations that have kept in the last days with the #turkish Prime minister and of the diverse meetings with the Minister of Subjects External Turkish, #can *comunicarles that the #turkish Government is fully conscious of the need of this fundamental change in the political field, economic, social and cultural.
The #finnish Presidency of the Council is making a serious effort to take use of the new legislative possibilities planned in the Treaty of *Amsterdam and begin to apply already the proposal after the first reading, a time incorporated the amendments of the European Parliament.
This material do not reflects this tendency to the increase of the index of substances harmful satisfied advances  eastwards, but that the high indexes of harmful substances give  in zones that accuse the influence of the local activities: the agriculture, the industry and the houses of *veraneo.
For the European Parliament, #this are facts consummated by the vote of the Council and it only that *nos remains is *explicitar that this measure has caused enormous unrest in the rest of the producers of the States members, say that the *excepcionalidad of this measure is not foreseen in the regulation, and signal that also other States members had climatic conditions *desfavorables in his moment and, without embargo, did not have it that now  *le is giving to *Portugal.
In summary, the socialists want to ensure the defence of the producers, of the consumers and of the importing Europeans, and believe that with the report that has approved the Commission of Fishing, with the excellent work that has made the speaker Mrs. *Fraga, to the that I want to congratulate, and with the agreement to that has got  in the Council of ministers #can, in big part, remain satisfied.
Besides, #this *OCM did not guarantees the income of the fishermen neither takes into account that in #some countries, as *Portugal -#where predominates the small coastal fishing that resupplies to the consumers of fish cool fish in his territorial waters-, the organisations of producers are very feeble, by it that no  *les #can concede *tantas attributions without taking into account the necessary financial means.

How plans has the Presidency to initiate a dialogue with the Parliament on the questions of security and defence and when will take the Minister of Defence of the Presidency a statement on the formulation of a common politics for the security and the #european defence?
Equally it has been necessary a big courage for the Government of #Grecia, for the Prime minister *Kostas *Simitis, bet by the hit of this change, to entrust in the possibility of a favourable result, and tend his hand to *Turquía and accept that it goes to negotiate with *Turquía as with the other #european partners, with the members of the Union.

Regarding the look of the juridical security, have to examine how #can contribute the Letter of the European Union to the improvement of the grade of protection of the fundamental rights inside the European Union and results difficult to see how #can a text no *vinculante contribute to clear and *transcender the current system of protection.
The recommendation on the evaluation of the quality and the upper education approved in September of 1998 and a proposal of recommendation on evaluation of the quality of the school education constitute proofs of the importance of the examination of the quality of the education in the #european level.
*Me Pleases that the Commissioner, together with my Secretary of State of Trade and Industry of my country, Mr. *Byers, has the impression of that the car industry European is taking the peel to the consumers of the Realm Joined, but have to say that I #can not suit with *usted in that it is a simple question of types of change, as *eso #would not explain that #some cars cost some four one thousand pounds more in the Realm Joined that in the Low Countries, for example.

A fundamental appeal that the Union *Europa has to direct to the New Independent States is the respect of the civil rights to root increasingly the democratic principles and the cultural pluralism, religious, politician and ethnic, so as to improve the quality of life of the persons.
I appreciate the references that have taken  to the Governor of *Macao, to the that, by it other, had the honour to appoint for this place in the moment in that it was President of the Republic and #can say that the governor *Rocha Scallop has been really a man that has honoured to *Portugal and has taken that *Portugal withdraw  of the territory of *Macao with the very high head and with fine consciousness.
*Señorías, taking advantage of this intervention and the occasion that *nos offers the presence among *nosotros of the president *Xanana *Gusmãor, want to manifest to His *Señorías my belief that, taking into account his peremptory needs and our common identity, the European Union has to establish immediately some special links with *Timor to guarantee his economic and social development and his independence.
We promised to increase the participation of the women in the resolution of conflicts and protect to the women of the conflicts armed, but the women follow constituting the immense majority of the victims of the conflicts armed, follow absent in the negotiations of peace and in the initiatives of transition to the peace.
As it is very known, in 1995, simultaneously to the Conference of *Beijing, drafted  and #make a document of the European Commission that adopts the principle to incorporate to #all his politics of development the relative politics to the treatment of the problems that *atañen to the question of the equality among the sexes.
The European Community has the delicate task to decide #which is the better path to follow forward with the progress and think in the care, the health and the environment of the children of the children of the children of the children of our children.
I stand out this situation because *nosotras, the women of the rich countries, is to say, also of the EU, have to remember #all the time that the that decide and with *ello also decide on our sisters in the countries in roads of development, *Kosovo, in the *Balcanes, etc., follow being men and that with *ello runs  the risk that the result of our work, the programs in general, do not answer fully to the wishes and needs of the women.
See it like an important task for *ustedes, colleagues in the Parliament and colleagues in the Commission, assume his responsibilities and occupy that these subjects have the highest rank, so that they also are a reality in the national parliaments and in the governments, in the European Parliament, in the Commission and in the Council.
In front of the evident samples that the #french Government has undertaken the *artero game of the mouse and the cat with the Commission and the #british Government and that, evidently, never has had intention to raise the embargo on the meat of *vacuno #british from a beginning, has got the moment of *pedirle accounts.
In this context, and had account of the little time of the that have, *me interests to clear a thing. #If to conciliate these two postures pretends to introduce a compulsory proof, and the possibility or the obligation to label the meat of *vacuno, is indispensable that in the moment of the lifting of the embargo to the import #can entrust in that this proof make  and carry out the labeling.
But a time that has taken place the process of query and a time that the scientists of the States members and of the agency have got to a conclusion on #which is the suitable mood to proceed in a situation determined, especially in matter of alimentary security, will impose  the *dictamen of the agency, will have to respect, will have to fulfil and nobody will be able to challenge it.
In similar circumstances the authority of an agency of these characteristics *calará in #all the European Union and no only will be a fine authority in the field of the security and of the public health, but that besides will provide a confidence among the consumers that consider absolutely fundamental and that will constitute the foundations to follow advancing.
Reduce the length of 90 to 60 days, as it proposes  in the amendment *nº 23, #would take that the Council went back to the ancient version of the proposal of the Commission and excluded the period that needs the debtor for his defence, it that in the majority of the countries #would add 30 days and the result #would be similar to the version that now have.

Besides, I believe that it prejudices a characteristic and genuine look of the trade *intraeuropeo, looming reduce the circulation of the literature by *Europa to the level of the pornography sent by post, as *me ensure reliable sources, in *sobres of paper of *manila brown without *remitente, and in the free world reducing the legitimate trade of books to the level of the import and export of smuggling to the *Europa of the East of the called subversive literature.
It do not surprises, with this record of attainments reached by #kuwaiti women highly qualified, that on 16 May 1999 His *Alteza the Prince of the State of *Kuwait dictated an official decree by the that conceded to the best the right to the vote and to present  to the Parliament. But it went the Parliament #who threw it down.
Gentleman President, estimated ladies and gentlemen deputies, my colleague #Michel *Barnier affirmed here on 16 November that the Commission follows with big attention the problems *ocasionados by the floods produced in the four departments of the south of *Francia, regrets deeply the loss of lives human and will take all it possible for taking get to the zones affected the suitable help in the frame of his competitions and possibilities.
To carry this sentence to the practical will be necessary the unanimous consensus of the Council and the ratification by the States members to modify the current law in virtue of the *cual the residents in the Realm Joined have right to vote in the #european elections, but no like this the residents in *Gibraltar.
Of face to the *quintas direct elections to the European Parliament of mediated of June and in the frame of a campaign of information projected by the #polish Government, has to take advantage of  the occasion to explain more acutely to the population the sense and goals of the enlargement of the EU or of the adhesion to the EU.
In the first place it is necessary to mention the possible advantage that they enjoy, especially, in the agricultural sector, in the that the economic situation *les allows the possibility to develop the agricultural activity from a point of sight ecological distinct to the that have come applying in the Union.
And finally, but no therefore less important, *Chipre: I will begin for saying that we value very positively and that in some sense *nos has reassured also -affirm it said by the Mr. *Bertens- the fact that the President *Klerides have shown his wisdom, averting tensions in the island with his decision to cancel the placing of those missiles of defence.
Besides, we have sustained a fruitful dialogue through the reports of commissions parliamentary on the annual reports of the Defender of the European Village, beginning with the *primer report of the Mrs. *Ahern and following with the reports of the Mr. *Papakyriazis, the Mr. *Newman and, this year, the Mrs. Of #Esteban #Martín.
No in vain the institution of the Defender of the Village constitutes #one of the most important elements of the #european citizenship and of the improvement of the democratic control on the community administration, democratic control that it #can attribute to this Assembly, like organ that represents directly to the community citizen.
I am convinced that the collaboration among the Commission of Requests, with #all the possibilities that offers, and the Defender of the Village, with his very varied competitions, will finish occupying an increasingly important place by it that to the democracy of the European Union and the respect of the rights of the citizens refers .
The Commission no only understands fully the worry of the Parliament by the delay in the application of the system computerised for the traffic, but that already had the opportunity to explain it that is taking in concrete to carry to term with rapidity the project. In this sense, want to give the thanks to the Gentlemen
Finally, the second separated of the amendment 20 do not respects the general principles adopted by the Commission, the Council and the Parliament in his Statement of 6 March 1995 on the registration of disposals financial in juridical acts and, by this reason, said section #can not be accepted.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0111/99) of the Mrs. *Schmidbauer, in name of the Commission of Transports and Tourism, on the White Book of the Commission titled: «just Rates by the use of infrastructures: gradual strategy for a common frame of *tarificación of infrastructures of transport in the EU» (*COM(98)0466 - *C4-0514/98).
By it other, adds in his report that apart from including the tourisms in the new system of *tarificación suits to impose complementary taxes more elevated to the motorists of the sensitive regions -here go in the mountainous zones and also the great cities as you Bear, *Hamburgo, *Frankfurt, etc.-. His concept #can not work and in case that it worked, #few States members #would know to resist to the temptation of *estafar to the motorists.
Meanwhile, the creation of a new juridical order international, that comport suitable means of «humanitarian interference» bumps with the irreducible opposition of great powers, like the States Joined of *América and #others, in relation with the reform of the Nations Joined, or the States Joined of *América, *Rusia, *Francia or Chinese, in relation with a compulsory jurisdiction of the International Penal Court.
I do not go to vote in favour of a proposal of resolution of conciliatory character and that consists, essentially, in a unilateral and inaccurate analysis, in *bastantes points, of the situation, whereas his postures and his proposals serve *mínimamente to a peaceful solution, political and viable of the crisis; neither so at least they serve to the tragic problem, by excellence, of the refugees.
In effect, #if to the beginning of the #balkan crisis that initiated at the beginning of the years ninety, *Europa had acted of common agreement and with decision to the hour to take univocal decisions *cuando began the *desmembración #yugoslav and #if, even recently, *Europa had presented  of unitary and compact form to the recent Summit of *Rambouillet, maybe #would not assist to the massacres and to the ethnic cleansings of these days.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0111/99) of the Mrs. *Schmidbauer, in name of the Commission of Transports and Tourism, on the White Book of the Commission about just rates by the use of infrastructures: gradual Strategy for a common frame of *tarificación of infrastructures of transports in the EU (*COM(98)0466 - *C4-0514/98)
The publication of the *primer inform of the experts on the tragedy of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc has added *algo of farce to a tragedy that has cost the life to more of 40 persons -#this is the balance, still provisional, of victims- and has opened the debate on the responsibilities that the #italian authorities and French happen  of #one to #others with absurd excuses and *injustificables.
Gentleman President, *permítame that, before it close the turn of word on human rights, express in high voice my satisfaction by the fact that today the Minister of Interior #british have decided that it continue the process of extradition of the General *Pinochet, in the line in that it expressed  the European Parliament.
Too much can, a control and an insufficient and deficient transparency, and the nonexistence of a register on the negotiations undertaken; lo and behold #some of the reasons to explain the deficiencies that present in the actuality the institutions of the EU, especially of face to his relations with the public opinion.
They exist still deep divergences on #some points among the European Parliament and the Commission, #among others: the repayment of the costs *ocasionados by the human victims and his families so much from the point of sight financial as from the point of sight of the psychological support.
Without embargo, in spite of the favourable economic evolution and of the significant structural reforms (reform of the administration, of the health, of the system of retirements), take fault still greater progresses in varied fields (inner market, absence of a system of control of state helps, privatisation of the great state companies).
It treats  in this case of #one *décima splits of the members of the Parliament, 66 pertaining deputies to #all the political groups: 5 of the Group *PSE, 8 of the Group *PPE, 4 of the Group *ELDR, 6 of the Group *UPE, 6 of the Group *GUE, 9 of the Group *V, 3 of the Group PLOUGH, 15 of the Group *I-*EDN and 10 no inscribed.
Already we had approved it takes a pair of years a program for the third age that, nevertheless, was blocked in the Council by the conservative governments German and British of then with the spent argument that there was not any juridical base that served of support, and that it was finally an exclusive responsibility of the States develop this politics.
The Commission has begun to *reflexionar on the way to adapt the social security to the development of the demographic structure of the #european societies. To this same *respecto, is examining  also the level of income of the greater persons.
They #can take part other factors, extraneous to the agricultural look, as they are the costs in hand of drama, the cost of the energy, the normative disposals on environment, the vicinity of the markets, etc. The economy of scale, like the that it #can appear, for example, in States Joined, that has of enormous units of production, sometimes integrated in the industry of manufacture of starch, #can give place likewise to comparative advantages.
This approval of the management do not involves *forzosamente the motion of censorship, although logically it induces to the Parliament to *reflexionar, and have suppressed the anomaly that appeared in the regulation, that pretended that the rejection of the motion of censorship approved  by absolute majority of the members of the Parliament.
The decision to approve the management is an only act that #can not dissociate of the political decision of approval of the management, a decision of closing of accounts that has to adopt simultaneously; #such dissociation #would modify the institutional balance and #would demand a review of the Treaties.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0240/99) of the Mr. *Bösch, in name of the Commission of Control Budgetary, on the proposal modified of the Regulation of the relative Council to the investigations effected by the Office of Fight against the Fraud.
To measure that advance to a new stage, a new situation in the that do not treats  of the Commission or the States members, but of the Commission and the States members, wanted to ask to the President of the Council that study this question of the activities among the Court of Accounts and the organisms *fiscalizadores national in the future.
We take advantage of also the document of the approval of the management of the year 1997 to remember that the Commission of Control Budgetary #would have to can have the necessary means to control the credits referents to the political groups and to the costs of secretariat of #the same.
Without embargo, #if *Yugoslavia represents the reality and besides the metaphor that describes it difficult that is to create, for the time being, some conditions of coexistence among *etnias different, then is necessary to recognise -to the equal that *usted- that only in the #european field and no in the constitution of small States increasingly enclosed and monolithic from the point of sight ethnic, will be able to reach  the conditions of a real coexistence.
It is equally contrary to the Letter of the NATO, is to say, to the Treaty of the Atlantic North, a purely defensive alliance initially and that it is transformed, by the circumstances, in an offensive alliance that takes part out of his geographic sphere, since *Yugoslavia never has formed part of the perimeter of the NATO.
We want that there #be a High strong Representative, a planning of politics strong and a unit of #alert fast, a strong structure of the Commission with a coherent squad of Commissioners that occupy  of the external relations.
Gentleman President, in the Commission of Subjects External, Security and Political of Defence have debated  simultaneously two very important reports related among himself/hisself as they are the report of the Mrs. *Piha on the northern dimension of the European Union and the report of the Mr. #Spencer on the strategy of the Union regarding *Rusia.
In my quality of coordinator of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists *permítame *decirle that the group will support the report #such as it is with the amendment of the Commission of Budgets voted the relative previous night to the extraordinary promotions *ad *personam .
Thus, I believe that they #would have to can  correct the irregularities that register  in the promotions of the personnel, especially now that the Mr. *Priestley has ensured that it treats  of a rectification of character only and that in the future will apply  a practice subjected to a big control, based in criteria and disposals related exclusively with the aptitudes of the civil servants and that will adapt  to the principle of transparency.
The fundamental reason of #all these reforms was and is -and also #this suits that they know it the citizens- increase the efficiency and the transparency of the Parliament, leaving in inheritance to the deputies of the next term of office an Assembly prepared to confront with hit his institutional paper and the challenge derived of a greater attention by part of our *conciudadanos.
*Señorías, have had the privilege to chair the work of this Assembly from the firm conviction that *potenciarla, *hacerla each more present day in the life of the Europeans, is the best mood to reduce the democratic deficit of the Union.
I believe that with his help, especially *cuando have treated on #many of the delicate political controversies of the last months, and the Conference of Presidents, have been able to keep together a coherent parliamentary vision, in spite of the tensions, the pressures and the distinct emphases that the Groups contribute to the debates.
It has gone back  to open the table on the institutional reforms and #this, it is necessary to say it, has been the big merit of the #german Presidency, from the statement made by the President in exercise of the Council in front of this Parliament in the month of January.
Certainly the that accustom to call in community language «the triangle of *Amsterdam; without place to doubts, the qualified majority that, as #all know, is not at all a technical question, but deeply political, because it puts in discussion the sovereignties of the national States and certainly it that *atañe to the question of the composition of the Commission and the weighting of the votes.
Gentleman President of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, have heard and read with #a lot of attention the resolution of the Mr. Of #Giovanni, to the one who take advantage of to congratulate and appreciate the exemption, the rigour and the impartiality, also like #mine president that it is of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, in the that have worked in the last years.
Although the financial credits for the next period of helps remain *algo underneath of the proposal *originaria of the Commission, is an essential hit that continue the grade reached of community solidarity with the poorest regions and of structures feebler of the Union without removing at all and that the Bottoms of cohesion continue.
I have had the weakness to believe that, to go out of the institutional and political crisis that has caused the resignation of the Commission with the bottom of the war of *Kosovo, his future President, the Roman Mr. *Prodi, *nos #would transmit an ambitious message.
To answer to these world-wide challenges, #would owe *forzosamente «reform the model of the *welfare» , «review the rules of the market of work and of the markets of the professions, to reduce the obstacles to the access of the market and [...] Create an employment that react more to the economic growth».
#If we join #this to the elections to the European Parliament of 13 June 1999, the European Union has to confirm his firm dedication to the principles of the democracy, of the solidarity, of the justice, of the transparency, of the stability and of the peace.
It is like saying that the Council and the Commission consider that the insular regions of the Union have known an economic development #such that questions the political will, expressed a year and half before by the Conference of *Amsterdam, to take in consideration of effective form the insular fact?
Since the Parliament has expanded the rights of the citizens and citizens with a wide principle of participation in the project of regulation -and only #this is the base so that the planning #can apply  also of sustainable mood-, the Council leaves that this subject of interest common decide it to his *arbitrio the States members.
The European Parliament has opened the possibility so that to the hour to choose the measures and projects #can use the consultancy of a small group of experts in the terrain of the *acervo community and of the problematic of the economic development of the countries of the ancient communist block.
The additional costs for actions in the rural areas are a discretionary disposal so much regarding the endowment of credits as to his application and are not a substitute by the loss of capacity acquisitive caused by the reduction of the prices.
In addition to the relative looks to the control of the vineyard and to the conditions of production of grape, form part the whole of the relative rule to the practices *enológicas, is to say, to the transformation of the wine, to the equal that the relative rule to the labeling.
Like this as, it is a political answer the that *le ask, gentleman, since I am in front of a minister, and wanted to know #if in the Councils of Ministers get *ustedes to talk no only, of course, of the immigrants, of problems of security, *algo that takes *usted very well -the #austrian and #german Presidencies reveal it #all the days- but also of the right of the citizens, together with the right of the capitals, to circulate freely.
In the frame of the bilateral conversations, the Federal Government German, in his quality of Presidency of the Council, has urged -even very *insistentemente- in diverse occasions to the #ukrainian part so that it modified these disposals by humanitarian reasons. Lamentably, these efforts have not had up to now any hit.
Subject: The dispute among the EU and the States Joined in relation with the diet of the banana #Can the Council make a statement on the last pertinent #news of the Organ of Solution of Differences of the *OMC that analyses the community diet of the banana and indicate how answer will give to his conclusions?
I include in my gratitude to #all the civil servants that *nos helped to get to a commitment in the that appear three of the main basic aspirations that had in this Parliament: have of a juridical instrument of horizontal character; of an only financial instrument, the *IFOP; and reach, besides, that in the regulation base collected , at last, #all the financial structural measures.
For example, the continuity of actions #tending to keep a modern fleet, safe and competitive; or #that that have shown to be instruments very effective of politics *pesquera, like the mixed companies with third countries, to the that the proposal of the empty Commission of content, *cuando #can be an excellent formula of cooperation with third countries, as surely it will show  in the future in the case of *Marruecos.
In a field it is necessary to praise to the Commission -the Mr. *Fischler has needed long until presenting a so good project, but *usted also has rejected during long withdraw the ancient project-, to the Presidency of the Council, to the Mr. *Funke, and also to the colleagues of the Parliament.
#The same States members have urged to the social speakers to undertake negotiations with the goal to reach an agreement -to any level- that promote the adaptability, balancing the flexibility in the places of work and without forgetting the security of the workers.
Gentleman President, in the page 8 of the Record, with the title «Election of the President of the Commission», alludes  to the vote of the Parliament referent to the approval of the designation of the Mr. *Prodi by the Bosses of State and of Government, and expresses  that the President congratulated to the elect President.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, like Speaker of the Commission of Freedoms Public and Inner Subjects, *me satisfies, of course, to the equal that to #all the colleagues that have taken part, that have achieved  an agreement and that the Presidency *nos have been able to communicate that the Agreement of *Schengen has integrated , in effect, in the Treaty of the Union.
The *segunda area in the that agree with *ella is that, in the question of the «*opting-*in» or «*opting-*out», choose it that wants to receive  or refuse it that do not wants to  receive, have to give to the consumer the right to take #this last, but the fact to prescribe how #can  or #can not  put in the network supposes to restrict of #such mood the expansion of this traffic that #would produce  a negative effect in the own only market.
Odd political is #this, that *nosotros ask to the Council a tendency that, apparently, *nosotros do not want to respect going against of the Treaties, against of our own Regulation, against of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and against of the same common sense, that says that, *jurídicamente, an act is an act and has the value of this formal act.
Regarding the Bottom of Cohesion, #this occupies a place aside, since his logic of finance is the of the finance by project and no by program; in spite of occupying a place aside, exerts a paper determinant in the sense to help to the economic and social cohesion, that is #one of the committed of the European Union.
Since we wish austerity in #everything it relative to the budget of the EU, #as well as a budgetary program marked by the rigour and some very founded priorities, *nos showed contrary to the increases proposed in the budget of the EU for the next exercises and have voted in favour to return the proposal to the commission.
A person like #Simon *Peres, for example, and other collaborators of the Party *Laborista, represent an unambiguous politics to the *respecto. In front of this situation, #can not but express our hope that also the #israeli part declare categorically that wishes to engage in depth with the peace and that will put end to the numerous measures *represivas that, unfortunately, have come  *sucediendo from the taking of the power of *Netanyahu and his nomination like Prime minister.
Gentleman President, the Palestinians have adopted a very brave decision and expect that the #israeli Government - so much the current Government like the future - show #the same determination. We need a #palestinian State sovereign, need that it respect  fully the sovereignty of the *Líbano and of Syrian and, obviously, also need guarantees regarding the sovereignty and the security of #Israel.
The arrest, out of the borders of *Djibuti, of #some leaders of the opposition -specifically in *Etiopía and in the *Yemen-, his extradition to *Djibuti and his imprisonment, the conditions in the *cuales find  arrested persons, the absence of trial, the absence of lawyers, the particularly difficult and painful conditions of his arrest: *nosotros know all *eso and is evident that #can not admit it.
Now well, the resolution that present fixed the goal to obtain the ratification of at least 60 countries until the end of the year 2000 so that in this year the International Penal Court #can go in in functions and asks to the Council that inscribe  this goal in the agenda of the European Council of Colony.
By a part, takes  a call to the sense of the responsibility of those who employ this freedom. But on the other hand, it corresponds to the public organs find suitable solutions to put *coto to the bad use of these hurtful freedoms for the society in general and especially for the taxes and the collection of taxes.
It is besides *algo favourable the fact that it do not tackle only the culture of the EU, which #would give foot to some type of nationalism of the Union, but that take upsetting also in the culture of other countries to the *margen of the EU and that extract favourable conclusions of the pertinent cultural looks of other parts of our planet.
It That Is producing  in the last months, especially -as it has mentioned the Mrs. Commissioner, Mrs. *Gradin- in the #asian zone, *nos concerns enormously, because the effort that has taken the textile industry -very positive- to put  to the day, to be competitive, to have an optimum position and quota in the international market, #can shatter  in little time.
Of the report of the European Council and of the statement of the Commission on the meeting of the European Council celebrated in Colony the days 3 and 4 June, -the statement of the Council on the semester of activity of the #german Presidency.
To difference of it that occurred in 1991/92, in this occasion the EU adopted a common position in the *Balcanes and took it because the #european States finally comprised that it that there was in game was not only a moral commitment or the future of a peripheral #european region, but his own security, the security of #all *nosotros.
The question of the #net taxpayers or the new regulation of the financial frame has been *esgrimida to the principle by the Federal Chancellor German especially in front of the #german public opinion but afterwards has *fracasado *miserablemente to the hour to solve the problem.
To #that *respecto, *me #would enjoy to ask to the Mr. *Fischer #if it sees, further of the conclusions of Colony, a perspective to short or to half term so that they adhere  the countries that still have not taken it to the article 5 of the Treaty of *Bruselas modified, is to say, to the clause of assistance mutual that links to the countries at present members of the Western European Union.
The second motivate is, it that has shown again clearly the war of *Kosovo, and perhaps exert here also a paper the different political experiences, very especially in the *Europa central, that only exists an only security in this continent: we #can not allow in this continent the nationalism, the racism or a primitive form in gross of the fascism.
Likewise we have ratified the conjoint resolution of the Council of Subjects General and of the Bosses of State on the location of the Department of reconstruction and have decided to summon a summit for the agreement of stabilisation of the *Sudeste of *Europa in *Sarajevo.
It is important to insist, as it has cleared the Minister of Subjects External in his intervention, in that the internal renewal of the Union and the consolidation of the national societies in #all *Europa will be the angular stone of the development of the EU in the future.
And I want to finish, gentleman President, with a question directed to the Speaker in exercise of the Council of Ministers External: #if *Turquía do not offers guarantees on the life of *Öcalan, #if *Turquía do not gives #some steps in the direction of the recognition of the political rights of the *kurdos, considers the #finnish Presidency that we have to advance in *Helsinki to the statute of country in process of adhesion?
Related with #this, the Council asked to the Commission that checked that the execution and operation of the systems of alarm of the EU are *homogéneos and effective, and in case to be necessary, presented propositions for *mejorarlos, and to his time considered the form to expand the systems of control current to fill up the possible lagoons.
In relation to the procedure of infringement #can *comunicarles that the Commission has initiated a fast procedure on *Bélgica on the base of the *art. 226 *TCE because the #belgian State did not fulfil with his obligation to inform immediately to the Commission and to the States members on the intoxications by dioxin neither acted entirely according to the Resolution 1999/389.
I do not want to get to the extreme to affirm that in the last five years have produced  #one *renacionalización, but with #all security, the Council, for example, to the hour to confront the consequences the crisis of the *EEB has not shown a greater prowess to mark  true #european goals that they were susceptible of control and also of sanction.
Second, it wanted to *indicarles that the annex 3 contains the composition of the tables of the delegations, by it that ask #if yesterday, *cuando vote this point -which took-, #if yesterday, as, were available also the lists with the names and with the composition, or #if yesterday we have voted without knowing the composition, which *me #would seem *inaudito, to the not existing the corresponding documentation.
Later it will integrate  to the Regulation; but #if tomorrow, before the approval of the Record, a political group, or well 32 deputies like minimum, of compliance with the section 4 of the article 180 of the Regulation, impugn this interpretation, the question will subject  then immediately to our Assembly, that will pronounce , as it is established, by simple majority, in presence of the third part of his members like minimum.
Therefore the priority of my Group is *eliminarlos and subject to the Commission to the common right, before that look for other solutions, like the to create the figure of the #european public prosecutor, that #would satisfy the federalistic manias, but #would not contribute much more with regard to the powers of the *OLAF in the fight against the fraud.
No *me force to remember here his names, but do not have to watch very far to see in these same seats to #who now applauds the proposal to create a *fiscalía #european, but that did not have *empacho in voting against of *ella *cuando takes a pair of years the proposed the Mrs. *Theato and *yo same, anticipating certainly that #this #would require to advance in the creation of a judicial space European and modify the Treaties.
Twisting the arm to the politicians of the European Parliament, leaving the path *expedito to the ideas on common defence, common taxes, a common politics of social provision, on the that on recommends  his reduction, leaving in end the path *expedito to this politics, in spite of it that think to the *respecto the #european population.
Yesterday I went back to remember it in the moment to proceed to the approval of the Record of the Friday of the session *plenaria previous and the Record signals now, on the one hand, that required the content of my intervention, without collecting how said really, and by the #another side, to continuation adds  a relation of #all the members of the tables of said mixed parliamentary commissions.
The only instrument to enhance this responsibility to progress in the control of the resources #as well as the improvement of the Administration is a delegation to be able to and responsibility more restricted. To #the same time #can improve  essentially a problem so *palpitante like the slow circulation of payments of the European Union.
They are in game the possibility and the need to issue a signal, to leave clear that *nos take very seriously the subject of the security and of the justice, to underline that in the Summit of *Tampere treats  to collect information in benefit of the security and the freedom of the #european citizens.
Lady Speaker, the candidate to Commissioner *Vitorino signalled in the round of questions that the goal of the preparation of a regulation of rights human #would not be only to find a common denominator among the States members but that the regulation #would be an independent statement of rights.
I create, to finish, lady Speaker, that the goals of the European Council of *Tampere are very ambitious, but think that only being ambitious in our obstinacy for taking reality this space of freedom, of security and of justice will achieve that the citizens of the European Union see in our works an effective instrument to face up to his problems.
. I have given my positive vote to the Commission chaired by the Mr. *Prodi, in the first place, because his President answers fully to the profile that sue the challenges to the that it has to face up the European Union when crossing the threshold of the *tercer #millenium, and because, in general, the Commissioners have given proofs of his capacity to answer to said challenges of effective way.
Gentleman President, this *burden *of *the *future of the that *usted talked takes years in the Commission of Budgets already is the ballast of the present, because I believe that we have taken case *omiso to his "warning" and have not been it sufficiently strong like Parliament not to yield to this deceptive saving by part of the Council, that presents a budget of payments forgetting warily that the commitments have to fulfil.
Without embargo, also the Commission #would go out winning #if the proposals went adapted in the sense that suggests the Parliament, so much in it that to the financial responsibility as to the structure of the Agency for the reconstruction refers , since it did not suffices with assigning the resources. It is #this the only form to guarantee an effective procedure, transparent and justifiable.
It satisfies to our group that the Council have collected with this diligence, as already it said it the Mr. *Wynn, the idea of the Commission of Budgets and that it have studied the fault of cost of the bottom of guarantee agricultural.
It is necessary that the Council and the Commission *prorroguen the suspension of the support to the economic and military cooperation, because Indonesian, gentleman President, did not attends to the argument of the human rights, only attends to the argument of the economic sanctions and of the military interests.
#If his strategy consists in discrediting to the Government of *España with falsities and, besides, in showing a *sectarismo *falsario, irrational and irresponsible, shows a self-evident inability to comprise #which is his mission in this Parliament -that is not precisely the to use the tragic death of a boy-, and then is really worrisome that his career begin of this way.
In view of that the Treaty of *Amsterdam concedes the maximum priority to the protection of the human health and in sight also that the European Parliament has now powers of *codecisión with arrangement to the Treaty, #can the Council ensure to the Parliament that #all proposal related with the lenses of contact of multiple use in experimental stage will happen by this Parliament so that the see and #can *aprobarla?
Subject: Situation in *Kosovo *Algo more of two months after the installation of the *KFOR in *Kosovo, no only has not achieved  appease the situation in the region, neither contributed to consolidate a climate of stability, security and peaceful coexistence of the distinct communities, but that, by the contrary, has exacerbated  and gone back even more taut the unstable situation originated by the bombardments of the NATO.
I share the objections concerning the election of the headquarters of the agency in question - in our opinion, *Pristina and no *Salónica.-, #as well as the objections about the apparent unilateral possibility - therefore, in opinion of the Council - to expand the activities of said Agency to other regions of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia without before at least consult to the Parliament.
To the equal that in the case of #all the current community agencies, the Commission proposes that the States members are represented in the council of administration, so that his presence guarantee the full coordination of the activities of the European Union with #that developed on the terrain by the States members.
The pending problems follow being #many: the 70% of the territory of *Cisjordania and *Gaza is occupied militarily; the statute of *Jerusalén without defining; the #israeli settlements and the expropriation of the earth and of the water; the more of 2.200 political prisoners in the prison; the question of the #palestinian refugees of the *primer exodus of 1948 and of 1967 that rise to some 4 millions.
In the *primer and second script of the section 4, the Parliament asks that the number of his representatives in the "enclosure" commissioned to draft the Letter was equal to the number of the representatives of the States members, is to say, fifteen like minimum; simultaneously, it removes  of in half to the national Parliaments, suggesting that only it proceed  to "a query of his presidents" .
We expect that the graphic and even thrilling demonstrations that have witnessed this afternoon in the Assembly and the so human gestures that have shown so much Greeks like Turkish in the last weeks, conduct to the strengthening of the relations among both neighbouring countries, #as well as among *Turquía and the European Union.
Also it #would have to examine seriously the enlargement of the mandate of the *OSCE from a point of sight financial and personal. I ask to the Mr. *Kinnock that commission to the Mr. *Patten that *nos inform in the Commission of Subjects External on the results of this analysis so that we #can adopt other resolutions.
The first -besides say it like historian of the medicine- refers  to the fact that, in a continent that has been destroyed by the colonisation, as it is *África, is not a chance that have arisen the epidemic of the AIDS but that it is the consequence of the impoverishment of this continent and, thus, are responsible, as ancient colonising metropoles, to help to *África.
#If well it is evident that the available technical potential for the production of energy aeolian and solar, from the biomass, hydroelectric and geothermal #would allow to cover quite more of the 12 % of the consumption of energy until the year 2010, without embargo the taxes of increase registered in the past *nos indicate that they will require  great efforts to reach only this 12 %.
In the first place, regarding the proposal that today  debate to fix in the 1,5% to the year the improvement of the energetic intensity of the final consumption - amendment to the considering 15 and to the article 1 - consider said goal undoubtedly ambitious, but little realistic, #as well as hurtful for the users that already have achieved with hit, but no without great efforts, the clear-cut goals in the program *SAVE *I (1991-1995).
A time approved, this program will convert  in an important component of the program mark *plurianual of the energy, contributing a greater grade of transparency and a better coordination of our programs in the sector of the energy, allowing that the Parliament #can exert his competitions of supervision in interest of the #european citizens.
And no only it is  using the support that are loaning of bilateral way #some countries -as also it is  carrying out a bilateral collaboration with countries of the *Europa central and oriental- but that also has to take into account the support that receive to *través of the program *SAVE and of other community programs, #where it that takes  is to hire with companies -that are the that give this type of support, of education, of education, of diffusion of technicians of good use- and, obviously, among *ellas there are companies of the European Union.
But certainly no *me will join to the demonstrations of *autosatisfacción of the #european institutions, that have even the pedantry to pretend that they have contributed of significant way to the disappearance of the diet of the apartheid in *Sudáfrica, *cuando the responsibility of the great powers, included the Europeans, is overwhelming in the maintenance of an infamous diet during so much time.
Precisely now, in the meeting of the Commission that finishes to celebrate , the gentleman Commissioner *Bolkenstein *me has *resumido of a mood that consider absolutely correct and require the reason by the *cual there are #some chapters of the fiscal politics that do not require any harmonisation and that live in the diversity as, for example, the taxes on the income of the persons.
But they will see *ustedes in the new organisation chart of my general direction that there #be a service to the citizen that, truly, pretends to be to the service of the citizen and that tries to answer to #all the questions of the citizens using, as it has asked the lady *Cederschiöld, the new technologies, but also using the support paper *cuando do not have  of other means.
Like this, as, it is important to understand the difference that exists in this moment among problems caused by the appeals that #can not  attend by budgetary considerations and the processing of the commitments, in the that, in spite of the difficulties had to beginnings of this year, the situation has improved, and costs the pity remember that #some of the problems had to beginnings of this year had little that see with the delay in the reception of commitments in December.
It is really incredible that this performance repeat  and that every time that there #be a question of a deputy, especially socialist, the Popular Party use the turn of questions to cover the shames of his Government and that do not take any question to the corresponding Commissioner.
The debates of today take place in a moment in that the relations among the European Union and *Turquía have the opportunity to leave in a new direction: precisely two months before the meeting of the European Council in *Helsinki, of the that expect  important decisions related with the process of enlargement in his whole and especially also in relation with *Turquía.
Lady Speaker, exists a quite grave problem: this proposal of resolution prays in the section 15 of the #italian text it following: "it Invites to the religious authorities to that they cooperate fully in the application of the programs of prevention and to that they take part *constructivamente in the action of prevention of the AIDS" .
I believe that so much the EU like the Governments of the States members have to follow toughening the control on the general operation of the field of the genetic investigation and, in particular, the application of programs that do not adjust  of the all to the guidelines established regarding the ethical, the environment and the consumers.
Gentleman President, am very satisfied that the European Parliament occupy  acutely of *Macedonia, as we have to have clear that *Macedonia is the #european country that at present sees  subjected to a greater danger by the unsteadiness of his neighbours, but on the other hand has made enormous progresses in the peaceful reduction of the problems of the minorities and of the tensions with the neighbours.
We pretend *convencerlos through the negotiation that the half more effective to attract to his countries external direct investments, road of privileged access to the technology and to the international markets, is first of all creating a safe and predictable frame for the foreign investors, already are *originarios of countries industrialised or of other emergent countries.
In the European Council stood out  that the development of the capacity of *Europa to control the crises #would improve the possibilities to take part to international level in the promotion of the peace and the security, following the criteria of the Fundamental Letter of the UN.
In the last legislative period have asked to the Council that occupy  of consistent mood of the security of the employees and of the population of *Bruselas and do not want *desaprovechar this occasion to ask to the Council that adopt an initiative of security for *Bruselas and against of the criminality in the cities.
As it already has *sucedido in the past *cuando this Parliament, the Council, varied bosses of state and the world-wide public opinion  *movilizaron to obtain a suspension of the execution, have to take once again all it that we #can to save the life of this victim of the racial hate and of a clear perversion of the justice.
*Nos Likes that the Government of *Bielorrusia and the opposition are encouraging  for boarding a constructive dialogue to end to suit in acceptable conditions for the celebration of elections just and free, restoring of this way the State of right in the country.
Gentleman President, after almost twenty years and in spite of the efforts of the #italian judicature and of the association of the families of the victims, do not know still the truth on the tragedy of *Ustica, a tragedy that affected to the #italian public opinion, #as well as to #all the #european public opinion.
Finally, *permítanme that propose two corrections: in the first place, our amendment 6, in the that ask that it do not go back  to put in operation the head office while it have not carried out an investigation, leaves very seated that are talking of the plant of conversion and no of the plant of *reelaboración of *Tokaimura, that is a different plant situated in a *emplazamiento distinct of the that occupies  a distinct company ...
Lady Speaker, our colleagues of the Commission of Fishing have warmed up always the wish that the relative questions to the fishing did not go argued only in the Fridays and have heard that in the afternoon of the Thursday there #be still sufficient time to argue a subject.
The communications and the commercial transactions world-wide electronics in the sphere of the services of the technology of the information are products #whose importance increases without ceasing, and the services in the sphere of the technology of the information will increase  in more of the 100% in the European Union of here to the year 2001.
Although the budgetary lines that they are responsibility of the Commission of Environment, Public and Political Health of the Consumers are not great in monetary terms, exert an important paper in facilitating the development of the politics of the Union and, especially, in *acercar more to the Union and satisfy the needs and wishes of the citizens of on foot.
Now well, in percentage of the gross inner product of the Union, the volume of the project of budget of the Council is inferior to the of the preliminary draft of the Commission, that already was inferior to the agreement of *Berlín, the *cual was to his inferior time to the ceiling fixed by the agreements of *Edimburgo.
I accept totally the need to perfect and introduce efficiency in the management of east and other plans and to improve the performance, but a more effective way to take it regarding modification of the budget #would be to describe the improvements and contribute a plan of execution for the future.
From the point of sight of the method, *me ask why the Parliament, when debating the report of the Central Bank of 1998, feels the need to include the approval of a specific measure of the *cual the Central Bank European will give account in the next report, is to say, the of 1999.
The fact that it was imminent a new review to the heaves of the types, as yesterday they gave to understand so much the economist boss of the Central Bank, Mr. *Issing, like the vice-president Mr. *Noyer, did not shows perhaps that the decision of the month of April was mistaken, had account that meanwhile we have not assisted to any unforeseen impact?
Said #this, owe *alzarme against the true statement of war against the workers and the unemployed of the European Union that constitutes the goal affirmed by the vice-president of the #ECB *cuando talks to "reduce the rigidities of the market of the work" , or also "*emprenderla with the habits rooted and the purportedly purchased rights" .
In the first place, we are not planning neither expect any change related with the distribution, as in the case of the *ONG and the organisations of Nations Joined and other organisations, carried out by our management or our politics. We answer to the calls and to the crises and resort to any organisation that #can make a good work in the specific circumstances.
Regarding the part of the question *concerniente to the paper of the members of parliament in it that take -and is another form to see the question-, want to say that in my opinion are decisive the own debate, the own dialogue among the Commission and the Parliament around the politics that have to carry out, and is of there of where take out the decisive inspiration.
It is not a lot it that asks my country: only that each member of the world-wide community fulfil with his part of the task, in development of the principle of responsibility shared. And that #all #can assume the costs of the durable solutions in the measure of the possibilities and of the available resources.
It has stepped  in relation with the *cuarta freedom of the Treaty of Blunt. The access to the justice further of the national borders, thanks to the mutual recognition of the sentences, and the possibility to combat the delinquency organised and the bleaching of money above the national borders.
In the field of the access to the justice, need that the mutual recognition go accompanied of some minimum common norms and #would have been well that had taken  decisions on the rights of the persons to obtain the freedom under bail *cuando are accused in a State that is not the own.
This same year, the European Council of Colony decided to draft a chapter on the fundamental rights that gather in an integral document #all the applicable fundamental rights to level of the European Union with the end of *hacerlos more visible to the eyes of the citizens.
It is to say, it goes  to make the definition of acts punishable, a harmonisation of the penal right material, the reciprocal recognition of sentences, goes  to create *EUROJUST and a protection for the victims of offences, is to say, a fan of measures that mean that it is a hit.
Even it observes  a weakness of the Union in the outline of a strategy to end to combat the social causes of the migration and to provide help to the countries of origin with seen to reduce the pressure to the European Union.
In the last seconds of this debate *me matters to highlight the judicial construction, the fact that the citizen, in addition to the security, in addition to the police, in addition to the fight against the crime, wants to know that the justice is #his, that is his justice, in any point of *Europa; that, in front of any judge, will have his justice.
Finally, the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary of the European Parliament has withdrawn the corresponding part of the project of resolution not to have problems with the Mr. *Duisenberg and the European Parliament finishes to back this *dejación.
In front of the current tendency to *desreglamentarlo #everything, the European Union #can, #if it wants to, endow of instruments that allow to promote a politics like this, from the *imposición of a taxation by the speculative operations until the application of a selective credit that incite to the creation of places of work and deter to the companies to take the suppressions in mass of places of work.
For my Group, Union by *Europa of the Nations, the frame inside the *cual poses  the question is quite delicate, because it exists a danger that consists, on the one hand, in configuring the suppositions of an imperfect competition and, by #another, in limiting the action of the States members in this matter, against of the principle of subsidiariness.
In a period of situations and *coyunturas critical in the international system, the negative option of the, only *superpotencia real poses a fundamental question. The of the reaffirmation of the political will of the world civilised to control with effectiveness the production and expansion of the arms that cause massive disasters.
The general of four stars Reads *Butler, responsible of the strategic strengths Americans endowed of nuclear armament and that has had his finger on the #red button during #a lot of years, is totally convinced that the mere existence of nuclear armament, that #can use in compliance with a political decision but also like result of a technical failure, is very grave.
Gentleman President, wail *verme forced to abandon the session with the Mrs. Speaker of the Parliament, and thus I want now signal, as it already said the Commissioner, Mr. *Patten, in his intervention, that the Union did not accepts the terrorism, but neither accept, in any case, the use exaggerated of the strength, that #can not be tolerated in any circumstance.
#If besides I see it that says  in the conjoint statement of the summit on *Chechenia, the most important subject by the moment in the cooperation with *Rusia: there it says  that the European Union and the Russian Federation exchange his positions on the situation in the north of the *Cáucaso.
The #ours is not only a necessary homage to the culture, but also a sober political trial that is born first of all of the *convencimiento to have like speaker to a State - in this case *Turquía - that is far still of the full recognition of the human rights and of the principles of freedom and democracy in the *cuales assent  the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, the agreement of fishing with the Realm of *Marruecos is with a lot the most important of the that has celebrated the European Union, because of the number of fuselages community affected, to the possibilities of fishing that opens, to the employments that depend directly of the sector -more of 8.000 fishermen and of 20.000 workers-.
The Parliament, this same morning, has fulfilled with his have to when including in the budget of the year 2000 a game of 125 millions of euros, that had not been foreseen in the financial perspectives negotiated in *Berlín, in virtue of the Agreement *Interinstitucional among the Council and the Parliament, but that it is fundamental so that it #can begin the negotiation.
It did not throw hand of the resources that have seen takes little, like the of the liberal democrat that drags a sack of meat #british by the airport with the hope that *algún *infortunado official *aduanero the arrest and, like this, #can take a timely photo, or the of the conservative that assaulted the *Bastilla two weeks ago in #París, also to take  a timely photo.
The Mr. *Graefe *zu *Baringdorf, colleague of my Group, #one or two times in his intervention referred  to the #english "meat" , but already knows  that in the Realm Joined there are four distinct countries, and in *Escocia, that is the #mine, the agriculturalists have #all the right to feel  abused, because, in the first place, do not have a serious problem of *EEB.
From the point of sight juridical, remains of self-evident that the #french law of 1 July 1998, that creates the Agency of Security Sanitary Alimentary, *sobrentiende that *Francia has of a sovereign power for *salvaguardar the health of his inhabitants.
It #can have problems to the principle, but the imperative of #all the that take part in the formulation of the relative legislation to this agency will be the to watch by that the competitions of each #one of the diverse institutions -already correspond to the community level or to the of the States members- have suitable reciprocal effects and each part know exactly where begins and finishes his competition.
That *usted declare now -the Mr. *Böge already has posed this question- that will not be able to  impose until the year 2003 the compulsory labeling and the identification of the origin of the animal from the moment of his birth is, to my seem, #one of the causes of the gangrene that supposes #all this crisis of the *EEB.
The Parliament has in front of himself/hisself relative proposals to the labeling, as it says His *Señoría, with arrangement to the article 152, relative to the procedure of *codecisión, and His *Señoría is in it true when saying that these disposals on labeling establish the obligation to facilitate information on the animal from the birth, by it that the disposals on a thorough labeling are a valuable instrument.
From the point of sight of the States members by separate, the risk do not finds  in the inflation, but in the disproportionate increases of the nominal wages, increases that *ocasionarían a drastic descent of the competitiveness and profitability of the companies and, in consequence, a loss of places of work.
#All the actors agreed in the need to keep the stability of prices and negotiate agreements *salariales compatible with the goal to continue with the process of *saneamiento budgetary -in accordance with the programs of stability of each country- and to complete the structural reforms in accordance with the processes of *Luxemburgo and *Cardiff.
The Commission published a White Book in 1997 to end to finish with these irresponsible exceptions; in 1998, it presented a communication in the that appeared, among other things, a proposal of directive to modify the relative directive to the ordination of the time of work.
It is a plan *quinquenal directed to reduce the deaths in the road and the quantity of traffic in the roads and to watch by that the quality of the vehicles in the roads correspond to the highest levels possible to protect the environment.
It That we have to guarantee it is that it #can give  to the patients the ideal level of attention of health and of protection of the health in the sanitary service and also that the auxiliary doctors receive the highest level of possible training with ideal norms for his conditions and labour day -it that will mean a reduction of the hours that work- and also the #others obligations that have to fulfil simply to loan his services.
And for *eso need a clear juridical order, a juridical order of the inner market, with his principles, that *irradie to #all the #others political and through the *cuales the citizens have a clear idea of it that has been  taking from 50 years ago and that now, through these initiatives, believe that will have a vocation of future absolutely ensured.
Also it wanted to mention our feeling -like the of *usted- that the common citizens and currents have to see an increase in the rapidity and the efficiency of the procedures of infringement against the States members in the that the rights of the citizens of the European Union exerted inside the Inner Market result violated or *denegados.
To5-0045/1999 of the Mr. *Menrad, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the proposal of decision of the Council [*COM(1999)0440 - *C5-0173/1999 - 1999/0192(*CNS)] by the that creates  the Committee of Employment and on the proposal of the Commission "Lines guidelines for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000" [*COM(1999)0441 - *C5-0147/1999 - 1999/0816(*CNS)];
we Happen to it essential and *démonos explains that it is not possible to have a politics of employment better #if, happened the stage of convergence economic and monetary, do not want to establish the full social convergence and fiscal, with some common norms for #all the countries of the Union.
Thanks to the constructive proposals for the politics of employment of the States members in the year 2000, proposals based in a hit analysis of the conjoint report on the employment, the report of the Mr. *Menrad traces the path to follow so that *Europa take advantage of of optimum form his extraordinary human capital.
The analyses show that the States members have tackled #a lot of very significant initiatives, that #this take with more seriousness and give more importance that in the past to the qualification and to the continuous training of the workers and that by means of this politics of employment have created  also new places of work and, in concrete, gentleman *Brie, also want *decirle #this, in the sector services.
The European Commission has reason *cuando criticises in his report the fault of progress in matter of employment for these less favoured communities of the States members and takes a call in favour that it put  a greater emphasis in the principle of "*mainstreaming" in our programs of employment regarding measures to struggle against the discrimination.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0041/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive 93/104/*CE relative to determined looks of the ordination of the time of work to include the sectors and the activities excluded of said managerial (8642/1/1999 - *C5-0036/1999 - 1998/0318(*COD) (Commission of Employment and Social Subjects) (Speaker: Mrs. *Smet)
Precisely because I agree, believe that this Parliament #would have to take advantage of the occasion to indicate to the Court of Accounts his big restlessness in front of the fact that a document of the substance of the that has prepared the Court have filtered , in correct or wrong terms of content, to the newspaper *Der *Spiegel of 8 November.
*Me Refer to the fact that in the common position takes  reference to the health in his physical looks, psychic and social, to the quality of life, to the violence in what rape of the human rights and, in particular, to the fact that this program includes also to the victims of abuse and sexual exploitation.
The program has like solid base the recognition of the need to sustain the human rights and the of the boy, according to the Convention of the Rights of the Boy *promulgada by the Nations Joined in 1989, as also the of the women, #such as they expressed  in the Statement of *Beijing and in the Platform of Action of 1995.
I consider that the sum of this initiative with the open perspectives by the meeting of *Tampere will end, in a near future, in common definitions, in common penal procedures and in common sanctions that the States members will apply to the crimes of the traffic of persons and to the crimes against the boys.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, in the month of April of 1999 the European Parliament approved in first reading his legislative resolution on the proposal of the Commission by the that created  a general frame in the field of the information and the query of the workers of the European Union.
The problem of bottom to the that *nos confront #can *resumirse simply like this: or well the system of resources own  *nos gives in copartnership, forms part of a package of measures that the Parliament will ask to examine in the Conference *Intergubernamental so that it was -as it #would say *yo- more democratic, more participatory, or well, only #can check, lamentably, on this point that touches to move piece to the Council, it that it #can last long #if our proposals do not take  in account.
It has taken  reference to the Inner Market, that is the most important frame in the that now we act: in *él it is necessary to put end to the great subventions for the coal and the nuclear energy and the support to the renewable energies, like important look that is of the environmental politics, has to be realistic.
Without embargo, in spite of the positive general evaluation of the directive, believe that they still remain #a lot of problems for solving, like the full application of the new diet for the citizens of countries third that live in the European Union, and also for #that that coexist out of the narrow familiar frames traditional.
#If it was necessary to invoke an alone reason, #would be the interest of the children and doubt that #if our Parliament approved these two amendments, *ello *redunde in the interest of the children, that expect a lot of the fast establishment of a regulation that *les recognise the mere right to not having to suffer the election of his parents to live in different #european countries.
We are in the stage of query of the committees, integrated especially by other States members, and therefore #can, before finals of this year, propose an informal definite decision for the approval of the map of the Goal 2 of his country, as probably of the #others three countries that went object of the first decision of the Commission, on 26 October.
Subject: Violence exerted against the women The majority of the actions allocated to solve the problem of the violence exerted against the women are of character *curativo and go directed to women and girls. It is the case of the subventions to special centres in the that the women #can *refugiarse with his children, or the of the rehabilitation of the victims of the violence.
And the *segunda: How opinion *le deserve the actions of pressure that is exerting in these moments the Administration of the States Joined against #some #european companies -*me refer to the #spanish chain Sun *Meliá and to other companies like the Club *Méditérranée and the German *LTU- and #which are the measures that, to his trial, #would have to take the European Union?
The initial difficulties also indicate, nevertheless, and do not owe *hacernos illusions to the *respecto, that the ancient consensus that determined the combination of liberalisation of the world-wide trade and establishment of some compulsory commercial norms, and that always took for granted that #this #would influence of way predominantly positive on the national tendencies, said consensus has begun to crack .
The citizens, the no governmental organisations and the companies of the European Union go to follow the negotiations of *Seattle with greater attention that in #any another previous occasion and will put the point of watches in the possibilities that the world-wide trade was as a whole juster, social and *equitativo and take in consideration #all the interests.
Particularly in the field of the agriculture, have to respect  the conclusions of *Berlín like absolute minimum criterion in the frame of the negotiations, as it is not possible to leave to take into account the situation of the small agricultural exploitations familiar and of the agriculturalists with a difficult geographic location.
First direction, concretise the principle according to the #which these negotiations have to be useful to the countries and populations with difficulties, with the affirmation of the right for the Union and the States members to defend his politics of development and the specific agreements with the *ACP and the rejection to see the agreements of *Lomé put in *entredicho by the *OMC.
In contrary case, exists, with reason, the danger to finish in a *American *world that defends the trade with enthusiasm, but that forgets the remaining values of the *European *dream, is to say, the solidarity in addition to the competitiveness, and the responsibility in addition to the economic growth #can not be that the goal consist in subordinating #everything to this only paradigm, in that it have to preach from *Seattle to the rest of the world?
As, alas, the other parts negotiators *nos follow to #a lot of distance, the EU needs the additional help of the no governmental organisations- in his work for converting to the *OMC in an organisation *perdurable from the point of sight of the environment, of the health and of the welfare.
#All coincide in that before the enlargement of the Union and the incorporation of new States is necessary to make a fundamental reform that allow to keep the effective operation of the European Union and improve also, add *yo, the transparency and the possibilities of control of the decisions in the field of the #european politics.
To #the same time, there are not obstacles to argue the subject in the meetings of the Ministers of Health and like this treat to create no a collaboration, but yes contacts, and perhaps exchange information among the different countries to treat to develop these methods in the different countries of the Union.
Subject: Greater federalism in the adoption of decisions of the EU The minister of Subjects External of *Finlandia took part in July in *Estrasburgo in name of the country that exerts the Presidency of the Council and indicated that, in accordance with the goals of *Finlandia, "the Union has to have an only will, a common politics and an alone voice".
The Commission of Subjects Constitutional, in fact, has admitted three amendments of the Mr. *Méndez of *Vigo by means of the *cuales, as a result of the application of the Agreement *Interinstitucional reached in the Parliament, has awarded  a special paper to the own President of the Parliament, to the *cual will transmit  the informations on the deputies.
We #can accept likewise the principle of the amendment 6, that leaves very seated that two games of digital prints are equal *cuando are identical, and no *cuando are only similar. Also we accept the principle of the amendment 12, that is directed to clear that the data #can not send never to the country of an applicant of asylum neither use inside a Been member for extraneous ends to the question.
It requires  a complete application and adapted of the resolutions of the Organisation of Nations Joined and of the Extraordinary Assembly, and requires , gentleman President and gentleman Commissioner, a special clause against the drugs, that include  in #all the agreements with third countries, a clause of #the same level and consideration that the clause on the human rights.
In the agreements on the intellectual property, *Europa has to deny to patent the life, has to guarantee the maintenance of the exceptions to the general norms of the trade concerning the medicines used in the fight against the AIDS and the other grave illnesses established by the WHO.
I reproach to the conservative Group of this Parliament that have procured to suppress the relative considerations to the development in the Permanent Forum with the *OIT that has proposed , and that have encouraged  it *indecible by *desviarnos of our consistent goals in reaching a balance *equitativo in it social, #as well as a free trade.
2) it centres the review in an agenda that only has to see with, essentially, the questions of the power of decision and corresponding to the new balance among States members, when reducing, in name of the equity, the weight of the States economically less developed in favour of the economically more powerful, to the *cuales pretends to attribute the mechanisms of a reinforcement of influence;
To fault of another better thing, will vote in favour of the resolution, by the that asks  a moratorium on the pity of death; but I consider that the fact of no *atreverse to adopt a position in favour of the immediate and unconditional abolition of the pity of death constitutes an abdication in front of the barbarism.
Second, in *Kosovo no longer is the #yugoslav army, but our armies. By a part, and from any point of seen, are making a glorious work in the fields of the reconstruction, the protection of the citizens and the reorganisation, but, of another side, are exasperated because they do not reach to protect to the persons to the that they have to and want to protect.
The current report speech with total clarity in a series of points and aims in any case with enough clarity that #if no *redoblamos our efforts against the instigators and the capitalists of the *narcodelincuencia and his wash of money, the states of Right, the populations and our youth will lose this war.
Have understood that *usted has directed today a writing to the Defender of the European Village, but #would wish to know when will have the deputies the opportunity to answer to the appeal of the Defender of the European Village to comment his query of initiative own.
A substantive politics, of course, and provable by part of *Turquía, of advance by this path. By the path of the state of right, clear is, by the path of the fine *vecindad and of the peaceful coexistence, by the path of the abandonment in #all the fields of the military methods, especially in *Chipre, but also, how doubt fits, in the question *kurda..
The Mrs. *Halonen so only has achieved to insert a quotation of the society of the information - believe that in the last sentence of his intervention - and without embargo, according to a document that received of the Commission the past week, in *Helsinki will present  a relative initiative to "and-*Europa" , a document titled "Society of the Information for #All" .
In virtue of #the same, the persons and his fundamental rights also remain excluded of the right of sovereignty of the #another splits signatory, further that we always have kept that the requirement of the respect of the human rights do not constitutes an interference in the internal subjects of a country.
*Turquía, nevertheless, keeps the pity of death. Now well, although it #can be difficult change the mentality of the policemen, change the situation of the prisons, suffices a law, suffices a parliamentary vote to abolish the pity of death, as they have taken #all the countries of the European Union.
In this moment, *yo do not know how decision will adopt  the next week in *Helsinki. Nevertheless, in any case, am firmly convinced that the decision that has to adopt the European Parliament on these two regulations will influence on the result of the deliberations still in course and also on the decision that adopt the European Council the next week.
Taking in consideration the request of the European Parliament in the first reading, the Commission gives now the *primer step to incorporate to the legislation the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon and the consumption of fuels of the light industrial vehicles, is to say, of the vehicles of the category *M1.
And in this sense go the amendments that have presented to this proposal of modification of regulation: two in the *considerandos, in the that considers  that the formula of helps to the transformation is really important, that the quota is insufficient and that the Commission goes to present, before the start of the next campaign, a proposal to happen of quotas to thresholds.
With regard to the problem of the double fixation of prices, agree with the idea that we will have to define a moment from the *cual the double fixation of prices was absolutely compulsory and is the only form to begin to make #any comparison, although #all are conscious that only in the last months of the year 2001 the public opinion, the citizen, will begin for real to take the comparisons.
The Parliament will ask the acceptance of the essence of the measures and resolutions of 25 October 1996, the Report *Gallagher, and of his opinion of 26 April 1998 on the application of measures technical in the politics *pesquera community.
#If they take into account, among #others, his considerations and relative criticisms to the *parco presupposed that *le attributes the regulation and to the exclusion of the Common Organisation of Market of almost #all our aquaculture, #as well as his partial criticisms to the norms referents to the information of the consumers and to his defence of the contingents *arancelarios, *cuando exists community production, will improve definitely the regulation.
The first consists in saying that the European Union has not been *recompensada by the efforts made and that, beyond all doubt, at all has to expect of the #turkish Government, since after the application of the agreements on the Union *aduanera, has not effected , according to #some of our colleagues, any sensitive progress.
We regret that in the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer have not treated  to look for a reasonable point of #inspired commitment in the principle of the realism.
The agenda includes the questions that remained without solution in *Amsterdam, that are the size and the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the votes in the Council and the possible extension of the vote by qualified majority in the Council, #as well as other subjects related with the Institutions in the frame of the quoted questions.
The fault of transparency has hampered, especially, the taking of decisions in the Council; the #finnish Presidency has begun to put in new practice procedures to increase the transparency, and is to expect that #this root before elaborating an official rule.
The fulfillment of the austerity in the budgetary politics #can not, neither has to, remain under the responsibility of the Commission of Budgets, but that the main responsibility, regarding the Parliament, *recae logically in the Conference of Presidents and also in the Spokesmen of the political Groups.
The #finnish Presidency of the Council has achieved to fulfil a truly important program; the Summit was a hit, a good final brooch for the year 1999 and a good point of game for the future, with the Statement of the #Millenium.
The proposal of the Commission has like goal the that the amount of 26 millions of euros was distributed by the States members with some criterion, in a table of distribution that take into account, above #everything, the number of appeals of asylum that each Been member have received in the three last years and the number of refugees that found  in the territory of each #one of the States members in the three last years.
*Yo Believe that the collection of tolls also #can contribute in the long run to a reduction of the costs of the mobility, #if they achieved  the goals that pursue , or was, reduce the jams and the accidents and, especially, improve the protection of the environment, no only in relation with the pollution of the air and the noise, but also in #many other looks.
Therefore, *yo owe *decirle with #all clarity to the Council that with his fault of initiative, to the not considering the proposals of the Parliament in the frame of this third alternative that have presented, this week *nos have put in a very difficult situation, next to the limit of it in accordance with the regulations admissible.
The increase -as they said our mates- of two grades of the temperature, that foresees  of here to the year 2010, #if they do not take  measures, the increase of the level of the sea, the disappearance of small islands and #many of the catastrophes of the two last years that, according to the experts, have to see with the climatic change, are taken that they had to *obligarnos to adopt immediate and concrete measures already.
We promised to guarantee the equality of access of the women and his full participation in the structures to be able to and in the taking of decisions, although in any #another field is so great the inequality of deal among both sexes of swear and of *facto that in the field of the taking of decisions.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0077/1999) of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, concerning the common position (5748/1999 - *C5-0034/1999 - 1998/0228(*COD)) adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone (Speaker: Mrs. *Hulthén)
*Nosotros said that it no longer was possible follow to the *OMC without comprising the requirement to include as *primer point of the agenda the principle of caution, the cultural diversity, the social rights, the protection of the environment and the reduction of the inequalities of development.
*Europa Has to support in this movement, in this new public opinion world-wide, to promote another type of regulation of the international economy, based in the redistribution of the wealths and in a distinct balance among it that depends of the market and it that it has to follow *incumbiendo to the democracy, among it that depends of the *librecambio and it that it has to depend of the cooperation.
. (*FR) Have voted against of the project of resolution on the labeling of products alimentary produced from organisms modified genetically, since has by only object give green light to the Commission with seen to propose a regulation by the that it establish  that *cuando an alimentary product contains *OMG that are underneath of the limit of the 1%, the labeling that signals his presence #would not be compulsory.
Lady Speaker, lady Commissioner, do not fits the lower doubt that the *quinta conference of the UN on the woman, the Conference of *Beijing, constituted #all a milestone in the path to the equality among the sexes, since there surprisingly produced  the agreement of #all the countries of the UN around a common planetary platform of action.
Since they have suggested  some parallelisms with *Seattle, wanted to remember that the institutional frame is not #the same, neither neither is #the same the institutional paper that the Commission exerts in New *York and in the Conference of *Beijing that the that exerted in *Seattle, but swims *nos prevents -#if there #be political will- that collaborate the Presidency, the Commission and the Parliament, along these months, until June, that join his strengths.
The application of this rule will carry, among other things, to a more effective control of the borders and to the reduction of the illegal immigration of the citizens of the aspiring countries to the adhesion or that get to territory of the Union through these countries.
It fits to remember also that, although the Ministers designated by the States members for the Council of Governors of the *BEI #be to be #the same that take part in the sessions of the Council of *ECOFIN, the Council of *ECOFIN do not has competitions of any type to give instructions to the European Bank of Investments on his politics of credits or on his informative politics.
We do not ask information on the reasons by the *cuales the European Bank of Investments awarded the credit, ask simply #which were the general criteria that justified it and on the base of how assessments considered  the project -that, on the other hand, affects to #one of the richest regions of #Italia that, among other things, characterises  by a delicate environmental balance- and conceded  the credit.
The Council kept a deep debate in the session of the days 9 and 10 December 1999 on the communication of the Commission on the new control of the aerial traffic titled " Communication to the Council and to the European Parliament on an aerial space uniform European" .
Gentleman President, as I already have indicated before, the Council has begun to take part in this problem of delays in the aerial traffic and has demanded that the Commission act in this question, and, as I said in my answer, also have taken progresses in the course of the autumn.
Subject: Referendum of self-determination in the *Sáhara Western The #moroccan minister of the Interior, *Driss *Basri, affirmed on 3 November 1999 in The *Aaiún that the referendum of self-determination of the *Sáhara Western, foreseen for 31 July of the year 2000, "will be postponed two or three years" because of the 71.420 resources presented against the provisional census of voters that elaborates the Mission of Nations Joined for the referendum of the *Sáhara Western.
In the meeting kept on 14 September with the #finnish Presidency, the Ambassador *Eagleton urged to the EU to that it transmitted the message to *Marruecos and *Argelia that the international community aspires to achieve the balance in the region of the *Magreb and to that it left clear that, without this balance, is difficult to support the economic recovery of the region.
The interpretation recommended by the Mrs. deputy to the Parliament has his virtues and his defects, to the equal that occurs with the current practice to observe the valid rule in the procedures of the Court of Justices of the European Communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0099/1999) in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establish  measured of fight against the *morosidad in the commercial transactions (8790/1999 - *C5-0125/1999 - 1998/0099(*COD)) (Speaker: Mr. *Murphy)
Gentleman President, today debate at last the definite prohibition of the put in the market and the circulation of the *BST in the European Union. It is to expect that with #this reach to put end to a process of ten years in the that the definite decision remained postponed #one and another time with the argument that it did not have  of definite scientific knowledges that legitimated said definite prohibition.
At the beginning of 1997, in full crisis of the crazy cows, the Council had decided to create a system of identification of the animals of the bovine species from the place of production, #as well as a labeling of the meat, *facultativo in a first stage, but that it #would be compulsory from 1 January of the 2000.
It has to say that the evolution of the situation is particularly #baffling, had account that the Emir of *Kuwait, the Boss of State, in a brave decision that the Commission has received with satisfaction, has proposed to recognise to the women the right of suffrage active and passive.
But, in definite, it that here go to take in these last debates of the year and of the century is to recognise public and formally that #this is a pending subject, with it that *ello has to suppose also of commitment of no *cejar in our efforts until seeing fulfilled the goal that *nos fix with the approval of the statute of the Court, *presionando also to the Council and to the Commission so that they act in this same sense.
There #be another look that wanted to signal to the Commission and to the Council with regard to the amendment 5, that expect was taken into account, as the data in *ella requested, according to the Regulation (*CE) 1390/99, that went in in vigour on 23 November 1999, in his article 2, establishes that "each Been member will keep to disposal of the Commission #all the data classified by budgetary games that *le will be transmitted to appeal of the Commission in a maximum term of 30 days" .
It decided  put in practice two types of financial contests: by a part, loans, in that moment had reserved  245 millions of euros for the loans to these three countries, and on the other hand, a donation of 130 millions of euros that had like essential goal the to reduce the charge of the debt and improve the capacity of repayment of these countries.
It That *nos proposes the Commission is finally reproduce it that took  by #Georgia and *Armenia, is to say, foresee, a new loan that #would allow *reembolsar the previous, but in some much more favourable terms with the end to give a bit of oxygen to this country, and foresee a donation of 35 millions of euros for the period 2000-2004, with the end to relieve the charge of the debt.
A modification of the law on the general and direct elections of deputies to the European Parliament #would presuppose that the Council, with the assent of the European Parliament, decreed unanimously the corresponding norms and the recommended to the States members for his approval according to his constitutional norms.
And, especially, I do not accept that it pretend  create two categories, to know, Commissioners and *subcomisarios of the European Union, the same that exist Ministers and Secretaries of State, *cuando to #the same time says  -and *me *congratulo that the speaker have accepted my proposal in this sense- that the distribution of competitions among the Commissioners do not has to be a form of *jerarquizar small and great States.
Another point that have to underline refers  to the increase of the tax of unemployment in the Czech Republic, that, according to the Commission, has to  mainly to the *ralentización of the economic activity and of the effect of the process of restructuring industrial and economic of the country.
A tendency, very favourable also, affects to the reinforcement of the administrative device of the #hungarian State by means of the enlargement of the staff -it that in the Commission of course has caused some envy- and the organisation of some programs of training to half term.
Seen the limited available time, #this has not allowed the formulation of a proposal on the paper. Yes it is clear that the self-evident Commission a posture *complaciente, seems that it is prepared to satisfy the objections of the European Parliament and, for *ello, goes to admit modifications in the current proposal.
In the High Half Age, the introduction of the penny of silver endorsed by the prince was #one of the fundamental instruments to boost the economic development in #all *Europa. With this measure pretended  surpass the derivative difficulties of the private money.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0175/99) of the Mr. *Fayot, in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and Industrial Politics, on the communication of the Commission on the financial services: establishment of a frame of performance (*COM(98)0625 - *C4-0688/98).
#One of the things that expect of the only coin is that #one the monetary market in *Europa and carry it to the dimension of the monetary market American, so that, of here, #can take out the necessary investments to increase the activity of the #european economy and absorb a part of the unemployment.
The politics of the Union #would have to base in a pragmatic approach centred in three key sectors: first, it is vital that to the buyers of services financial  *les facilitate a clear and comprehensible information; second, the procedures of claim are fundamental of face to the confidence of the consumers.
I seat that the Mrs. *Benassar *Tous #can not take part especially because we had wished -or at least *yo had wished-*agradecerle sincere and personally his work, since it has achieved that it approved  this program keeping a difficult balance among the spirit and the political meaning of #the same and the limitation of a juridical foundation that, lamentably, consider very *restrictivo with regard to the goals of the own program.
We are #all in accordance with that it is necessary to ask to this country a provisional agreement to treat to solve the problem of the alpine ports; without embargo, have to remember the road characteristics of Swiss, an authentic cheese *gruyer with the tunnel of the Saint *Gotardo of 17 kilometres and 3 narrower metres that the of the *Mont *Blanc.
Without embargo, this important file #can not refer only to the good operation of the inner market or of the distribution of the resources among the States members and the Community, treats  to struggle of the most effective way possible against the international fraud and the delinquency organised.
Firstly, because it centres  in the goal to strengthen the independence of the Commission, as it develops it the exhibition of reasons, whereas the recent experience, after the resignation of this institution by reasons of irresponsible management, carries to the conclusion that, by the contrary, is necessary to reduce his independence and strengthen the controls that exert  on #this.
The current environmental problems in the countries applicants are resulted of great broadcasts in the atmosphere *provenientes of industrial activities, of the production of energy and of the transport, #as well as of an insufficient finance and of the oversight by it that refers  to the supply of water and the management of wastes.
Gentleman President, *cuando have had to explain the opinion of the Commission of Freedoms Public and Inner subjects in replacement of my colleague, the Mrs. *Zimmermann, have said that this Parliament is particularly satisfied with the initiative of the Commission and that appreciate it  to the acting Commissioner *Liikanen, in name of my #others two colleagues.
Lady Speaker, the violence is a specific characteristic of the contemporary society and a *enigma of the open society, a society that has lost his values and that creates new idols and new symbols *trastrocando at the end these traditional values that, by the contrary, always have constituted the base of our coexistence civilised.
We have to manifest explicitly our satisfaction by the fact that this intolerable demonstration of the maximum human contempt have left to be *tabú. Every time they are more frequent the debates that treat this subject #as well as the programs of action that pretend to combat it.
«Treating of a collective resignation of #all the members of the Commission owing to the loss of confidence of the Parliament, seems that the planned case in the Treaty that presents greater analogy is the of the article 144, that contemplates the case of a motion of censorship decided by the Parliament.
The section 7 includes a series of ideas on how a more flexible perspective and updated of the labour market and of the greater persons #would allow to reach new modalities of transition of the labour life to the retirement by means of new models, like the half labour day for the most greater.
Third proposal: authorise, in accordance with the #italian Government, exceptions to the article 92 of the Treaty that refers  to the helps awarded by the States, so as to concede fiscal benefits and incentives to #all the employers that set up -and have the intention to set up in the future- and keep in active able initiatives to guarantee employment, #as well as and especially an autochthonous life to #Venecia.
We remember: in the procedure of approval of the management for 1996 took  patent irregularities and contraventions of the Treaty because precisely the Annex *V had had for the denial of the approval of the management a greater majority that the that prescribes the own Treaty in the article 141 of the Treaty *CE.
In the commission have argued also the question of #if it #would be necessary to put in practice and fund to #european level special programs of employment for specific groups, like the youngsters or the unemployed of long length and, in concrete, with additional character to the programs of action national and to the measures of the structural Bottoms in the States members; #this #would be mistaken.
Now it arises also by part *socialdemócrata a true support in the field of the set up of this type of measures structural, that precisely are of importance to procure that it guarantee  the internal stability of the euro: a low inflation that comports costs lower, that also makes possible by means of these structural measures give employment to more persons.
From my point of sight, and say #this without exaggerating, #if the Commission had presented to beginnings of December a relative reasonable proposal to the improvement of the fight against the fraud *nos #would have saved probably the denial of the approval of the management little before Christmas and with *ello *nos #would have saved all it that came to continuation.
Gentleman President, first of all want to add also my voice to the praise to the efforts for the creation of the *OLAF, and have to say that the session of today is *revestida of some solemnity, since those that work in the Commission of Control Budgetary see today materialise some attempts that have demanded efforts and that have known moments of proof in the that it decided  #if the proposals #would prosper or #would not prosper.
There are observations on it that has conducted to this situation that finishes to describe my colleague the Mr. *Elles, a new politics of personnel, relative questions to the Offices of Assistance Technical, the report of the Commission of Experts and also #some guidelines for the reform of the Commission.
Now well, in our statutory texts, without damage of the modification of the Regulation that go to vote tomorrow, the form in that it regulates  the procedure of approval of the budget is written, is there, black on white. #Can be  in disagreement, but there #be not gone back of leaf, since #if a text presents  in the Plenary and refuses  the proposal with the *cual has agreed  said text, the proposal returns  to commission.
It is to say, there #be not text of the Council, there #be a draft of negotiations taken before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty and, therefore, of course, there #be not any official text of the Council and has not sent  any text to any part.
A work of boss of company that *le will carry definitely to coordinate better the responsibilities of the commissioners, to go back to define the tasks that have to make, to suppress #some of #the same and to develop other new, and that *le will carry also to reform the methods of management, the methods of granting of agreements, to resort to the *consultores, etc.
Gentleman President proposed, value his determination to put ready quickly the elements of an organic proposal for this region, so as to that establish  a stable relation that give a perspective to the current conflicts and to the potentials that -and here agree with *usted- #can temper  and resolve through a strong relation with the European Union.
Without embargo, *cuando observe how act the Ministers of Finances and, in particular, the paper that exerts the group «Euro 11», *me see forced to ascertain that the decisions glide  progressively to the plane *intergubernamental and that #this offers a scarce *legitimación democratic for some decisions of politics economic and monetary important, that go couples to the independence of the Central Bank European.
For the first time, we have written that *nos deny to concede said approval of the management, although the past 17 December refuse simply a proposal that *nos got, on the other hand, of the Socialist Group and that had been approved in extremis by a very scarce majority in the breast of the Commission of Control Budgetary, proposal that *nos requested to concede the approval of the management.
We do not combat against the legitimate interests of the #serbian village, but that it that wish is the return of Serbian to the breast of *Europa and an evolution of Serbian to the incorporation to the *Europa of the integration, on the base of the democracy and of the legitimate rights of the #serbian village.
We do not owe today increase the errors of trial initial that gave place to the premature interruption of the process of *Rambouillet, to jump  the Council of Security, to *marginar to *Rusia, to not appreciating in his just measure the effect of the bombardments on the #serbian village.
Gentleman President, is evident that in front of the terrible tragedy of #all the village of *Kosovo, literally *masacrado and expelled of his country by this horrible ethnic cleansing of the tyrant *Milosevic, and in front of the consequent and necessary intervention of the NATO -a necessary action, but painful, that certainly nobody has wanted neither wished- no *nos #can *atrincherar in the formalisms of the international Right or in the evident questions of formal character.
In subjects so concrete and so clear as they are the prerogatives of this Parliament, that is not lower of age and to the that, therefore, the Statute has to give a *margen of manoeuvre -#that is the sense of the structuring in text base and annexes- so that it #can execute and establish the disposals of execution of this statute with a distinct diet of the established by the article 190.5, so heavy, that demands unanimity in the Council.
#If we do not achieve it, #if it do not adopts  a statute this week or in the short term, wish to #all my mates #a lot of hit in the confrontation with a public opinion that will have #all the right to doubt that in the European Parliament remain somebody with a minimum of sense of the responsibility.
I believe that it is necessary *matizar the allusion that takes  to the agreement of credit *hipotecario, because also in this point it is necessary to remember that eleven or twelve of the States members protect better this credit *hipotecario by means of the notarial writing and the registration in a territorial register, and, therefore, it is necessary to understand that in the text alludes  to a stage *precontractual.
Gentleman President, *me refer to a letter that the services of the Cabinet of the President of this Parliament *me directed on 20 April happened in reply to the appeal of information on the formality given to the request presented by the spokesman of the unitary platform of neighbours of *Areeta, province of *Álava -populate #where have been born and #where alive, by it that have big interest in this subject-.
In matter of external politics and of politics regarding the Nations Joined, whereas European Union have progresses that make and things that say on the two essential questions that are the ratification of the statute of the permanent Penal Court and the moratorium of the capital execution that has been asked by a vote of the Commission of the Nations Joined in Gin.
But first I want to take advantage of this occasion to congratulate so much to the President of the Council as to the President of the Commission for having taken out continuously to collation the politics of employment and by *haberla followed with perseverance although, lamentably, the plan *Santer have not been followed sufficiently and there #be *fracasado in the Council.
#One *Europa that no only embrace the economic and monetary cooperation, but #one *Europa that also attend to the employment, to the fight against the poverty, to the care of the handicapped persons and of the greater persons, is to say a *Europa that no only want to take out benefit but that also want to be profitable for a society in the that have big weight the human values.
The two first steps are as it that have said: first, the famous *leftovers of *Amsterdam, with the additional analysis of the question of #if our current situation in it *tocante to the relation among the organs forces to other modifications of the Treaty and the Letter of Rights Fundamental, of the that have said that it has to be developed by the Parliaments.
In it *tocante to the execution and to the management, go to bet in the future of mood consistent by the decentralisation, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities, an enlargement of the cooperation to #all the levels and a substantial improvement of the monitor, the control and the evaluation.
After #everything *eso hid  a real attempt to recognise that the Report *Rothley *simpliciter of the past December, evidently, #would not obtain the unanimous approval of the Council; that the text of the Council of the past week, evidently, #would not obtain the support of this Assembly.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #all the insular of the European Union cheered , the night of 2 October 1997, when ascertaining that the Treaty of *Amsterdam signed by the Fifteen contained the first explicit quotations that recognise *institucionalmente the structural and permanent obstacles that suffer the insular regions and the need of *ponerles remedy.
On the other hand, in the measure in that *me seems also necessary to get to a commitment with the Council and the Commission, have suggested simply to the Commission of Agriculture of this Assembly, -that the has taken #his- an amendment of commitment that consists in boosting the network of security *llevándola of 1.560 to 2.000 euros by tonne.
In the moment in that *Europa is looking for his soul and *cuando the President of this Commission, gentleman *Prodi, *nos says that the will find in the #american culture, *me ask #if it #can not  transmit a bit of enthusiasm to the #european villages *permitiéndoles exert *algo stimulating and that form part of his culture, is to say, the solidarity in the fight by the human rights through the borders.
But, from the point of sight of a member of parliament that, even representing to the whole of *España, represents particularly the interests of the regions *ultraperiféricas, of #any form #would be interesting that the Council took an initiative so that the new Commission #can consider the subject from the principle, since the special diet needs a back development.
Anyway, #if in accordance with the regulations they had assigned by writing this question to *usted or to another member of the Assembly, himself/hisself had been able to proceed like this but, in this case, the Regulation limits the answers by writing to those questions that have not been able to  formulate in the course of the hour and average of the turn of questions.
It #can ensure besides that it goes  to carry out a coherent approach of the rural development keeping #the same groups of action local and contributing like this to avert the times of wait excessive that they #can constitute an important obstacle to the same rhythm of the development?
It wanted to give the thanks to the speaker, the Mr. *Colom *I Naval, since it has included the amendments of the Commission of Control Budgetary in his report on the financial forecasts and the agreement *interinstitucional, and to #the same time wanted to comment the most important, and also the most logical, of these amendments.
Like speaker in the shadow will be able to *pronunciarme on the amendments that have arisen like a commitment of the negotiations of the Council, *cuando the Council and the Commission *nos ensure that the corresponding modifications go to be really adopted and of this mood #can not arise the danger of a third reading.
It Peculiar of the system of the European Union is that, during #all these years in that the Council has acted like the legislative authority, has shown also his will to delegate the measures of application in the Commission with the only condition that #this carried out his committed jointly with committees of national civil servants.
And I take advantage of this occasion - since the quote, lady #Miranda- bear *agradecerle his big work, like the of the that the have preceded: the Mr. *Newens, #others that have occupied  also of this field and that have taken part, like the Mr. *Salafranca, the Mrs. *González *Álvarez, and, in general, even #that that always have shown  critics or have opted by a much more critical approximation to our relations with *América Latin in his group.
To end to protect to the patient, is to say, to the consumer, and think especially in our youngsters, is indispensable that remain guaranteed the application of the Directive 92/28/*CEE of the Council, of 31 March 1992, relative to the advertising of the medicines of use human in the field of the electronic trade of medicines.
It wanted to take advantage of the occasion to signal that the Commission of Subjects Juridical has characterised  always by the big inner work, the big effort of coordination that take among *nosotros, and to *ello have contributed #many of the that in this moment are here taking part and, especially, #ours speaker, the Mrs. #Christine *Oddy, that, with his good take, has facilitated and facilitates always the work inside our commission.
Therefore, taking into account #all these facts and not to incur in a defect that *nos #can carry to that there were resources in front of the Court of Justice and the lost -as it already has occurred in another occasion-, do not have more remedy that keep the criterion of the Juridical Service that this vote is by simple majority, and by simple majority will decide .
I believe that #this are the lessons that have to remember, that it is necessary to expect that the release of the smallest villages in the future produce  following the #palestinian method, that #this convert  in the normal method and that the #kosovar method was not more that a regrettable exception in the world-wide history.
After all, gentleman President, *Turquía and his village, was *cual was his ethnic and linguistic origin, belong to the #european aspiration and to *ellos also *atañen the humanitarian «and» liberal «statements» that the majority of the governments of the European Union, that are members of the NATO, affirm to want to apply in our wider region.
By #everything *ello, consider fundamental that the European Union act with big firmness and declare that his States members will be of the first in backing the ratification of this International Penal Court. We have to put #all our obstinacy in that the Court carry  to the practice and #can not leave this committed in hands of #some other States that have deployed a #worthy enthusiasm of praise.
It results that this attitude, that #many of *ustedes *tildaron in his moment of *antiprogresista, has imposed  with the time because of the impossibility to solve the problems related with the nuclear energy, the impossibility to solve the problems related with the security, the storage and the costs.
The Commission and the Parliament have to satisfy urgently the lagoons of the #european social legislation regarding the protection of the atypical employees and have to tackle without more *tardanza the corresponding democratic deficit: through an Agreement *Interinstitucional that *allane the path for the next modification of the Treaty!
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0243/99) of the Mr. *Schmid, in name of the Commission of Freedoms Public and Inner Subjects, on the project of Resolution of the Council on the legal interception of the telecommunications in relation with the new technologies (10951/2/98 - *C4-0052/99-99/0906(*CNS))
The proposal of the Commission to reduce now the quotas for the production and to increase the compensations of payment for the starch of potato *me seems a fine idea, especially because there #be determined advances inside the world-wide market that *nos #can surprise in the future.
The goal of the participation of the Union in the *Expo 2000 is to present the crucial paper that is exerting the European Union through his institutions, like a dynamic and progressive actor in the stage of the world in the primes of the century *XXI.
We #can not go back to commit #the same errors that committed  in *Bosnia, with a bureaucratisation and delay of #all the process, but that the European Union has to act with celerity and without bureaucracy; the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament have to assume jointly this challenge so that the suffered persons of *Kosovo, of the #ex-*Yugoslavia and of the *Balcanes have a perspective of future.
The opinions in this Assembly on #if the war was justified or #if it #can have  prevented diverge considerably, but the #german Presidency has reached -and here want to mention especially to the Minister of Subjects External- act from a clear position regarding the crimes of the diet of *Milosevic, but also looking for with *ahínco the peace in the *Balcanes.
The national Governments delegate with reason with the #european pact by the employment the responsibility by the politics of employment no to the level of the European Union, but know that in the era of the globalisation it is necessary to find a common answer and #this is hit.
Then all it that say on *Salónica, *Pristina or *Sarajevo no longer will have #the same sense, because today in the form to reconstruct with the Nations Joined, on the one hand, the European Union, by #another, and the *OSCE, by #another, created -and in *eso *estriba the danger- institutions of dependency in the that the reconstruction of the *Balcanes depends of our will, but do not finishes  to reach the free determination of the #balkan villages to administer  to himself/hisself same.
#This is the core of the subject and #this is the criterion that have used during the debates and in the study made on the enlargement of the European Union, a state of Right democratic, #this is the centre of our movement, of our Union.
#If we talk of a Pact of Stability, is not correct to cover the mouth to the persons that are demanding the instauration of the right and, besides, is necessary that exist a just peace, it that demands that there #be action and no the most absolute silence of the serious criminal acts.
The resignation of the Commission puts of self-evident that do not need  only institutions, but also mechanisms of control and will *comn to award to the Commission the paper that deserves and surpass the democratic deficit, a deficit #whose causes, to my seem, it is necessary *buscarlas no in the paper of the European Parliament, but in the relations of the own Council with the Commission.
*Cuando #One, as profane in the matter,  whole that they recycle  #all type of wastes with destination to the *piensos for animals, that years after the illness of the crazy cows follows  feeding to the herbivores with animal flours and that, besides, in the base of the *piensos for animals introduce  products totally *descontrolados, pertinent of the darkest countries of origin, really begin to *preguntarte #if sure enough #all these decades of politics agricultural European #would not have to describe honestly of total failure.
It That are seeing now is exactly #the same approaches that perhaps in his day treated to avert: the panic of the consumers and the protection of the market (a market that now confronts  really to a greater threat by the form in that it has developed  the crisis).
I am, by the contrary, convinced that only *cuando open  credible and realistic perspectives of reconstruction of the group of the country, and of his incorporation from this time on to the #european project, only then will produce  positive changes in the political scene of *Yugoslavia, included the weakening of the diet of *Milosevic and of #all what of unacceptable represents today regarding the paper of his country in the world.
His *Señorías will remember, definitely, that during his meeting of the 27 and 28 July past, the Commission of Subjects Constitutional examined an appeal of interpretation of the section 1 of the article 29 of the Regulation, formulated by the Conference of Presidents in his meeting of 21 July.
The Commission of Subjects Constitutional got to the following conclusion: "The statement of constitution of the Technical group of Independent Deputies-Mixed Group, is not admissible according to the section 1 of the article 29 of the Regulation of the European Parliament" .
#If we had explained although it only went with the type of inspection that proposes the Mrs. #Jackson, protecting the earth and the half urban, #would have protected, even indirectly, to the majority of the dead persons, to the injured and to the thousands of persons that have lost his houses these days in our capital.
This assessment tempered  little afterwards by Pascal *Lamy, but without that comprised  very well how half #would use to control the globalisation without demanding a deep change of the rules of game, mainly by means of the introduction of the concept of cost social or environmental in the international negotiations.
An act that will make without any type of reservation so that the Union go back to have a strong Executive, renewed no only regarding the persons, but to the perspectives *programáticas and first of all to the way in that it will tackle the important internal politics and international that require democratic institutions, effective, transparent and respectful of the mutual autonomy and, nevertheless, *cooperantes.
A #european democracy requires a process of *constitucionalización, an order of peace demands the value to assume the responsibility by the own security, and to take reality the social and ecological space will be necessary that the politics  *emancipe of an ideology *neoliberal increasingly aggressive.
Will have new tensions and wars, as we have had in the *Balcanes, resulted of the politics of the two *varas to measure in the field of the respect to the human rights and of the independence of the villages; will have increase of the unemployment, intensification of the privatisations, ruin of the small and average peasants, professional, and artisans, restriction of the social rights, constriction of the democratic freedoms.
Gentleman President, of course there are #a lot of fields in the that it is necessary to issue trials on the Commission, but, to my trial, in the first place has to pose very simply the question of the confidence; with other words, #can as parliamentary, like representatives of our villages, presuppose reasonably that the new Commission will not take #the same path that conducted to the fall of the Commission *Santer?
We know and we reaffirm the legitimate doubts in front of the criteria that chaired the individual designation of the members by the governments and see with worry that in the composition of the Commission have not taken into account the results of the last #european elections, neither the previous tradition of greater political pluralism.
Second, it wanted *recordarle also that the Mr. *Fischler *nos announced the mandate written for the negotiation of the *importantísimo agree of fishing with *Marruecos, question of the maximum urgency so that this Parliament #can follow keeping the budgetary reservation of the game agreed by the Council and that was not his Commission, gentleman *Prodi, the responsible that there #be not finance for this agreement in the future.
It has not celebrated  any individual vote in any commission on any Commissioner, neither any Commissioner has seen  forced to withdraw  like result of the questions on his suitability and any Commissioner has assumed any type of responsibility by it occurred in the past.
#If we reach to strengthen the paper of the European Union by means of the creation of a space of justice and of an effective fight against the delinquency, will be able to, to #the same time, deleted the known distrust in the possibilities to tighten even more the cooperation in the breast of the Union.
Lady Speaker, the route of the Presidency of the Council by the #european capitals has allowed to identify three spheres to the that the Speaker in exercise has referred  this morning: the asylum and the immigration, the fight against the delinquency *transfronteriza, and the establishment of a juridical space European.
Lady Speaker, lady Speaker of the Council, is true that with these pertaining questions to the juridical field and the reflections about the preparation of a Letter of rights fundamental have got to a decisive stage in the evolution of the European Union.
The European Council of *Tampere, fruit of the initiative -because all it is necessary to say it- and the obstinacy of the President of the #spanish Government, #José #María *Aznar, has to confront this subject with #the same political will that manifested  in the extraordinary summit of *Luxemburgo to confront the grave problem of the unemployment.
The gradual absorption and historical integration of the Basque Country by the #spanish State, always consequence of bellicose defeats in the past, #as well as of the massive arrival of pertinent immigrants of other areas of the Iberian Peninsula, has supposed a *desdibujamiento and dilution of our personality, of our idiosyncrasy *originaria #basque.
This "examination of step" of the school executive future in front of the representatives chosen by the #european citizens represents an important stage of the democratisation of the #european institutions that constitutes the horse of battle of the socialists.
Second, also was a bridge regarding the political priorities that this Parliament wanted to establish to the future, to the new #millenium, especially in the category 4 -the external actions-, #where the European Parliament took an effort to increase the credits of commitment.
At present it has initiated  an urgent program of immediate humanitarian help and generous by part of the Union, but a time conquered the independence requires  a support to the economic development, and equally important will be our support to the constitution of institutions democratic.
Now I want to add three requirements to the already presented: in the first place, it is necessary to demand that the military controls, that know that they have taken part in the terror, are expelled immediately; second, it is necessary to send humanitarian help it before possible to *través of the program of the THROW and coordinate this performance in a program on a long-term basis; and finally, like the groups *paramilitares follow *aterrorizando to the population, is absolutely necessary to send international troops of pacification.
Nowadays, in front of the spiral of atrocities in the country and the evidence that these aircraft have used  in attacks against the population of *Timor oriental, the Mr. *Cook has effected an amazing twist of 360 grades: the past Saturday cancelled the agreement and introduced a temporary embargo of armaments.
Also we #would have to ask to the Mr. *Cook why the money of the #british taxpayers has used  to fund this scandalous episode and, besides, why the Ministry of Defence of the Realm Joined took part specifically for *cerciorarse that it had invited  to the exercise #indonesian to assist the next week to an important fair of armaments in Big *Bretaña.
Subject: Establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of the capital penalties In numerous occasions, the *PE has asked that the EU promote an initiative in the breast of the Nations Joined in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of the capital penalties.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, is important that the Union follow of wall the development and realisation of this type of projects and that try by #all the means contribute to that the head offices are it safer possible and to that his use or his structures do not represent any danger for the security of the citizens of the Union, neither neither for the of the countries in question.
They will allocate  back games to condition the roads for the winter, to the twinning of municipalities, for it that is requesting  help of the States members and, later, the public services, the public buildings, the reconstruction of the economy and the creation of institutions.
In other terms, in place, simply, of *centralizarnos in *Tesalónica or in *Pristina, #would have to take out the lessons of *Bosnia, and treat to create able autonomous structures to decide, in *Pristina, the way to proceed to the heavy reconstruction, is to say: bridges, houses, streets, #etcetera, and to #the same time the way to reconstruct the tissue of the civil society.
Gentleman President, the situation in *Kosovo characterises  by the *pertinaz effort of the *UÇK for exploding the presence of the strengths of the NATO and of the *KFOR, with seen to impose the total ethnic cleansing to coast of the #serbian, of the #gipsy and of any #another nationality, except the Albanian, that live in *Kosovo, and to build his own state embezzling the region of the #serbian state.
In the section 2, the European Parliament thinks that the preparation of the Letter *incumbirá jointly to the Council and to the own Parliament, *cuando is evident that today the fundamental rights are protected by the national Constitutions and that #all exercise referent to these rights #would have to affect of way *prioritaria, #if no exclusive, to the national Parliaments.
It is an odd coincidence that a judicial procedure, of #whose cleansing and correction am not fully convinced and that a sentence, of the that am still less convinced by fundamental considerations, to know the sentence of death against the Mr. *Ocalan, have taken that it exist a big opportunity to finish with a terrible internal war inside *Turquía.
The Group of the *PPE hails thus the serious efforts of almost #all the political strengths of *Togo so that it was irrevocable the course to the democracy and to prepare for the next months some elections to the National Assembly that are democratic and free of pressures of the army and of the President of the State and of his surroundings.
In April of the present year, the common position of the European Union consolidated the political decision of October of 1998 with the inclusion of the visas of traffic and the prohibition of visits tourist to affine persons to the #burmese authorities.
I believe that the big interest that today is arousing the building here gives samples that there #be had, to my trial, a fault of debate previous with the members of the parliament, a fault of debate previous with the users.
It #can not be that the General Direction *III was competent for the foods transformed, the medicines and the genetically modified organisms, that the General Direction *XXIV in reality also was it a bit, and that, besides, the General Direction SAW and the General Direction *XI have also #any competition in relation with the foods for the animals.
*Me Pleases that in this examination go  to tackle the main reasons of worry of the Parliament in his resolution of July, #such like sufficient controls in the chain of production of *piensos for animals, a register of #all the producers of *piensos for animals, *rastreabilidad of the ingredients of the *piensos for animals and the fixation of limits for the content in dioxin.
To the sight of this modification of the juridical foundation, immediately after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the European Commission modified and reviewed in depth his proposal on 21 May 1999, on the base of the *dictamen of the Parliament of 11 March 1999.
Without embargo, is important that in the debate of today, in #day of the debate in the Parliament on the Conference of follow-up of *Kioto that celebrated  in *Bonn, but also #few days after the second nuclear accident graver of #all the times (this time in a country of advanced technology), also situate the program *ALTENER inside a wider context.
The energetic efficiency means lower consumption, conservation of the sources of energy no renewable and reduction of the dependency of the imports of energy, but especially means inferior levels of environmental pollution owed to hurtful substances, #such as the CO2, #one of the most important causes of the effect of *invernadero.
In function of the military operations, the situation of the refugees #can aggravate considerably in the case that an offensive of the Talibans launched among 180.000 and 200.000 refugees more to the Valley of the *Panshir. With the arrival of the winter, this region #can convert in the valley of the death.
Subject: Purposes of the Commission in relation with the fight against the drug and the prevention of the doping in the sportive field The Championship of the World of Athletics of *Sevilla went back to put on the *tapete the question of the doping of the sportsmen of elite.
Since in my opinion the sportive organisations have to assume his responsibility in the fight against the use of drugs in the sport, *me ask #if there are plans to initiate *algún type of collaboration with the sportive organisations Europeans to end to resolve this problem that has arisen in the last years.
It takes some ten days celebrated in New *York an extraordinarily positive meeting, together with the Presidency and the Minister of Subjects External of *Portugal, with the Regional Association of the #Asia Meridional, headed by his splendid President, the Minister of Subjects External of *Sri *Lanka, that was -gives the chance- #mine mate of faculty.
By it other, in February of this year ask to the #spanish authorities that watched with special attention the conditions of crop, crop and transformation, so as to avert the "hunting of premiums" Today same have had news through the newspapers that a region of *España also has taken letters in the subject and has withdrawn the subvention to varied producers.
*Usted Knows, gentleman Commissioner, that in *España today no only the newspapers of more thrown but practically #all the #spanish press brings in cover the grave irregularities found by the inspection of the Council of Agriculture of the Joint of Communities of *Castilla-The Stain in the transformative companies of linen that were in *litigio and that have been heard and analysed by the commission to the that has taken  quotation.
Second, in the question *kurda have given  some first steps -although under the miserable circumstances of the conviction to death of *Ocalan- to a political solution and in the field of the human rights no only has produced  the release of *Akim *Birdal -although it only was by reasons of health- but that have produced  also #some legal changes that expect carry  likewise to the practice.
My Group believes that the discipline of the condition of candidate will comport a more serious preparation of *Turquía for the adhesion, a firmer dialogue and a greater exhibition to the culture and the politics of the European Union.
The #turkish public opinion, the public opinion advanced, political, social and business *nos sues a clear message, but this message includes the approximation among the European Union and *Turquía and, to #the same time, the impulse of the democratic values that, sure enough, today follow without fulfilling .
The international legality do not looms with using the violence, do not serves  of the political blackmail to predominant states, of the doubt on the borders and of the bonds that derive of the international treaties, and in general, of the posture *provocadora in the international life.
The appeal of *Turquía has to evaluate on the base of the following criteria: his geographic and economic situation of strategic importance and the repercussions for *Europa; the fundamental paper of *Turquía like member of the NATO and how #can keep  said association #if we follow continuously *dándole with the door in the noses; *Turquía, that as future responsible member of the EU #can convert in the *apaciguador of the dissatisfaction that arises in Orient Half and further.
The agreement of *Ankara is not sufficient reason as from this agreement with the *CEE, *Europa has shown his disposal and capacity by means of three modifications of the Treaty, the European Only Record, the Treaty of *Maastricht and the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to transfer more competitions of the national level to the European and deepen in this way *Europa.
The goal #would be to deepen the questions that still pose problems: the questions related with the human rights and the minorities, as it is natural, but also those questions that have to see with the economic relations, on purpose of the *cuales *Europa has to fulfil his commitments on the union *aduanera and accelerate the preparation of the corresponding financial protocol.
With reason of these technical votes on veterinary and phytosanitary questions, #would wish to remember the importance that has the fact that the countries members of the European Union conserve, *soberanamente, in the national plane, his freedom of trial and of decision on #all the relative questions to the alimentary security.
Also we have the responsibility to choose among the fears *milenaristas, the resistance to the change, and the opportunity to make, in the frame of the globalisation for the growth, the human development and the protection of the environment.
Gentleman President, the agriculture will follow being, as, #one of the most important files of the next negotiations of the *OMC, and our #european institutions seem to put of agreement so that it recognise  our agricultural model European, so that it protect  to the consumer and to consider that the agreement of *Berlín is the frame of the mandate of the negotiation of the Commission.
Therefore, it will comprise *usted, gentleman Commissioner, our worry with regard to the apparent absence of points of common sight, in the breast of the Union, before the beginning of the negotiation, *cuando the States Joined seem to have very clear his opposition to the system of helps #european, *disculpándose elegantly of the payments of flexibility.
*Cuando Celebrate our debate in the audition with the Commissioner takes roughly a month, my commission, the Commission of Environment, was really quite divided with regard to the suitability to present relative measures to the trade of the broadcasts, but believe that it costs the pity explore this line.
Nevertheless, my question to the Council is the following: it do not believes the Council that the own #european institutions have the duty to give example in the subject of the equality, and is satisfied the Council with the current situation of the personnel of the institutions?
These facts are of a special gravity in a territory like the of the European Union, #where the protection of the human rights is a fundamental subject, more still in these moments in that it works  in the preparation of a European Letter of the Fundamental Rights.
With the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on 1 May, according to the new article 13, the Council has the possibility to adopt measures for the fight against #everything of type of discrimination, included the discrimination by reasons of sexual orientation, but always inside the frame that establishes the Treaty and without limiting the application of other regulations.
Subject: *Incumplimiento of the regulation 1239/98 on reduction and disappearance of the networks of derives The Council of ministers that took place in *Luxemburgo in June of 1998 decided the disappearance of the networks of derives in the fishing of the tuna for the 1.1.2002, and, by means of the regulation 1239/98, the minimum reduction of the fleet in a 40% for the year 1998 and the annual preparation of lists.
It results even more surprising that the General Secretary of the European Parliament, violating perhaps unintentionally the duty of reservation, take a preface in the that *elogia this yearbook, and in the that it #can read, in particular, that is an useful reference for the men of business and that even constitutes a true public service!
I am fully convinced that I #can support, together with my Group, the report of the president Mr. *Napolitano, because the modification of the Regulation and the proposal of decision answer seriously to the worry of not subjecting to the deputies to excessive and arbitrary controls, a worry that finishes to show also the Mr. *Dell' #Alba.
Gentleman *Bourlanges, *usted signals with #all the reason that no only takes part the question of a more suitable control and some more ideal agreements -that also are important looks-, but that besides is precise to answer to a fundamental question, to know: of how subjects has to take  charge the public administration and #which #can entrust  to low private companies determined conditions?
The perspectives of *Edimburgo *nos fix a higher ceiling and the Council *nos gives a budget always more reduced, which takes that it was necessary *arañar of the actions in matter of development, for example, of human rights and #many other actions, to fund the priorities that fix , and is not #ours fault #if *Europa is the big treasurer of the external politics.
#If there #be not possibility to access to the services of health reproductive, #all the family suffers the consequences, especially the boys, that in the worst of the cases also die *cuando dies the mother or leave to assist to the school and are badly fed.
#This reflects the fundamental orientation of the #european institutions, attendants to facilitate the activity of the great capitalist groups, included it that *ella has of more *nefasto for the society, like the plans of dismissals that are responsible of the gravity of the unemployment and of the extension of the misfortune.
Have the possibility to leave clear in front of the citizens and the citizens #which are our goals to *través of the program directed to the youngsters, of the program #Socrates, of the cultural program, of the relative looks to the women and to the equality of opportunities.
In what they fulfil  the relative conditions to the processing and the internal procedures *interbancarios, the banking sector #would have to can reduce substantially the price of the transfers of credit *transfronterizas and reduce the time of execution to the necessary for the domestic payments more a day.
*Yo Support, therefore, the request of the report of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary by the that urges  to the #ECB to that it adopt immediate measures to take fully effective at least the specific relations with the European Parliament that foresees the Treaty of the EU.
*Nosotros Believe in the independence of the Central Bank, but this Central Bank is much more independent that the *Bundesbank or that the North American Federal Reservation, because it do not is born of an act of the Parliament neither #can be modified with an act of the Parliament, because it do not coexists with an economic Government.
We expect that, in base to the decisions of the Council to create on a long-term basis some common procedures of management of the asylum and to concede a situation of equality in #all the Union for the legal refugees, have opened  a path that convert to *Europa in a zone *homogénea in matter of asylum and shelter.
The second significant look is -by it that *Tampere has constituted a hit- that for the first time has produced  a clear delimitation in the politics of asylum, the politics of migrations labour and in the politics for the received of the displaced by wars, of temporary refugees, with some first concrete measures to the *respecto.
According to the record of this conference, the specificities of the #european villages #would have to melt, in effect, as in a *melting *pot world-wide, in the that -quote- "the rights and the obligations of the *migrantes #would have to be similar to the of the citizens of the European Union, the statute of the citizens of third countries #would have to be similar to the of the citizens of the States members" and *ello in function of a supposed principle of no discrimination.
The invitation to the Commission to value the possibility to create a budgetary reservation to the *respecto will be important, but follow being very little still. It is precise that the European Union in his group take  charge of the extraordinary influx of immigrants no community with a strong action of solidarity to the most exposed States, in particular #Italia.
In effect, the *scoreboard is not so only an instrument of programming legislative, is also an instrument of strengthening of the transparency and the responsibility of #all the #european institutions bear with the citizens, because the citizens are the owners of the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice.
*Señorías, do not talk of a definite reform of the #european institutions, but of a sufficiently strong reform to avert the blockade of the institutions or his asphyxia; of a sufficiently strong reform, as it said the #another day #one of His *Señorías, that allow in the future other evolutions.
And in any case, from the European Parliament, #can not but encourage to that this text include a systematic approximation to #all the looks of the European Union so that the new conference *intergubernamental occupy , one by one, of #all the subjects and the problems that *nos occupy in this moment; taking into account the #aristotelian logic, is to say, that political is the art of it feasible.
Now well, the same that the economists grouped in the Association by the Monetary Independence of *Francia, consider that this goal is not desirable and that onº 1 January 2002 it will be necessary to conserve simultaneously, by a part, the national coins and, by #another, the euro, that will exert the paper of coin common.
The release of capitals, the suppression of the economic borders, the change of models owing to the high technology and of the society of the information, the world-wide competition, are elements that many times comport changes and brusque restructurings in the industrial production.
#That is the spirit of the resolution that propose to His *Señorías and only with these conditions will keep *Europa his political paper when allowing an economic development for real durable of the companies and when protecting the rights of the employees that are -do not is necessary to forget it never- his alive strength.
In particular, consider that the case that today are debating has to represent the occasion so that the Commission assume, today, in front of the European Parliament, the commitment to value and review the directive on the dismissals and the closing of companies, so as to *convertirla in more effective in terms of protection of the places of work.
It That the European Union has claimed with firmness has been: in the first place, that with independence of the worry by the terrorism *checheno - that it is comprehensible - is the argument of weight to cut across the problem of a proportional way; second, we defended with *tesón a reduction of the climbing and the political dialogue.
#All know that our cultural coordinates have to see with our mood to be in the world in what #european and that an action of bottom linked with the cultural life in his multiple expressions is a condition *sine *qua *non for the strengthening of a consciousness of identity #european.
It will allow the valorisation of a common cultural space allocated to boost the creation, the cooperation, the exchanges, *salvaguardar and give to know better the heritage and the history of the #european villages and boost the full development of the cultures.
Obviously, it is necessary to avert reopen the debate that already have made this morning so much on the agreement reached among the Groups on #if it had  or did not have to mention the company of the that so much has talked  this morning as on the specific question of #if the signatories of a determined text of commitment knew or did not know that it had changed a part of the text.
We have communicated to the Moroccans that are had to contribute to the solution of the existent problems in the frame of the program *MEDA, but as I already have said, the #moroccan part still has not engaged  to the definite implantation of the system proposed.
Lady Speaker, wanted to take a relative explanation to my observance of the Regulation of the Monday happened on the distribution of a repertoire of the House of Trade American in *Bruselas that contained informations gravely erroneous on me, on the deputies of my Group, but also on numerous other deputies of this hemicycle.
In the bottom, sure enough, the crisis has to  to the obstacles raised so much by the European Union as by the *OMC to the application of the principle of caution. The way to apply adequately the principle of caution is to go back to a true subsidiariness, no *trastornarla as it has taken  in name of the ideologies *librecambistas and federalistic
Gentleman *Fischler, and also *me direct to the gentleman *Byrne, the last events in the crisis of the *EEB, or the *beef *war, that no longer limits  to *Francia and Big *Bretaña -in this moment also the States *federados of *Alemania adopt a frankly negative posture-, leave clear that *nos find in front of an enormously difficult task and that before that at all we have to elaborate a politics of the responsible and transparent consumers.
In relation with the agency, it only that *puedoe take is to remit to His *Señoría to the answer that have given to the Mrs. #Jackson, in the sense that I am convinced that the creation of an agency of security alimentary centralised in the level of the Commission will be a big step to delete this type of difficulties.
And #this *sucede because managers of the dramatic promotion of the unemployment are the own politics that is applying  and the initiatives that are developing . A politics that gives absolute priority to the economic look in relation with the social, to the *sostenimiento monetary in front of the social security and that proclaims like maximum law the pact of stability, that has to apply without hesitating.
It That fear is that the dialogue *macroeconómico try to export to scale #european the method and the system of *concertación in #Italia, that is the method that has carried our country to the levels of growth lower, to the taxes of unemployment higher and to the levels of inflation higher.
Like this, the subjects now are the transitory disposals on the doctors in training, the subject of the period of application of the total of the directive and the limits of the time of work for the crews of the fuselages *pesqueros.
By #this, in my quality of speaker, *yo recommend that this democratic look integrate  in the scientific and technical cooperation, is to say, that the members of parliament of Argentinian and of the European Union, or was, the European Parliament, also keep a dialogue in scientific matter and of investigation, and possibly also establish new priorities.
That at present they transport  to thousands of kilometres of distance through *Europa #some isolated components of a product, for afterwards return a part of #the same to the country of origin, no only indicates that the costs of the transport are too much low, but also that *algo fails in the system, in the system of restitutions by the exports, for example, or in the of the regional denominations of origin.
It is *algo that it has to determine in each case, although it wanted to underline a look that also remains of self-evident in #one of the paragraphs of the resolution proposed. With *eso *me refer to the big importance of the mutual recognition of norms, since this procedure guarantees a fast application, a big flexibility in a world that changes very quickly and a greater respect of the purpose of the subsidiariness.
Regarding the readers of universities #italian that do not possess the #italian nationality, #can communicate to the Mr. *MacCormick that today same have signed a letter to the *respecto #whose addressee was a member of the European Parliament that had formulated a complaint in this same sense.
*Nos Please the comments of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary that it #would have to take special upsetting in the need to reduce the administrative costs and the fiscal charges for the #SME and that #this represent #one of the greater obstacles for the growth of the employment.
The three commissions to the that belong #can identify  with his excellent work -made under a considerable pressure of time-, anyway the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects and the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and only with #any reserves the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities to the *cual is applicable *aquello that less it #would have been better.
*Me *congratulo That the Treaty of *Amsterdam recognise to the European Parliament the possibility to add  more closely to the application of the European Pact for the Employment and that, thus, our Assembly have been able to manifest about the guidelines of the States members for the year 2000 in matter of fight against the unemployment.
In *tercer place, the Council showed #one some reservation in the introduction of an especially compatible vehicle with the environment -in this point have proposed #some additions- and in the strict control of the avoidance of the *cycle *beating, as it has *sucedido also in the States Joined, is to say, that the manufacturers #can delete without more the values limits by means of electronic manipulations.
Likewise *me seems especially significant the recognition of the important paper that exert the no governmental organisations and the networks *multidisciplinarias, #as well as the public organisms that already make a valuable work, in particular in the field of the prevention, the support and the protection of the victims.
In 1999, to celebrate the *décimo anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Boy, gave  an active priority to the rights of the boys inside the #european initiative for the democracy and the human rights, chapter *B. 7/7 of the budget of the European Union.
Therefore, we have to proceed jointly to be able to include the existent procedures and that for the Commission are formal procedures, to know, the intervention of the supervisory committee and on the other hand the right of the Parliament to listen to the candidates and to know the position of the supervisory committee.
Gentleman President, gentlemen Commissioners, although the weight of the environmental values has grown along the years, the goal of the energetic politics of the Union has to follow being the security in the supply of energy in the national economies, #as well as in the industry of *Europa, to competitive prices.
To the light of the statements of the Commissioner *Byrne, see it that says the Group of Work Permanent of Medical European Auxiliaries: "The investigations have shown that long periods in sail like the that confront the auxiliary doctors (that they work *demasiadas hours) reduce the performance to a similar level to the of the excessive consumption of alcohol".
. (*FR) In spite of his general title, a time withdrawn the paper of gift, early remains of self-evident that the proposal of resolution presented by the Mr. *Chichester is allocated first of all to boost the nuclear industry with the pretext that it produces little CO2, at least in the relative stage to the head offices.
I consider very problematic to apply other scales out of the Community, including the here mentioned cases and believe that #all #would take well #if we took of the closing a scale no only for the *Europa oriental but also for the energetic politics inside the European Union and did not put in danger the existent possibilities like consequence of an additional deregulation.
As I said in that occasion, #one of the goals of the establishment of similar system of proofs was the to watch by that there was a system of proofs equal in #all the European Union to end to determine the levels of contagion in #all the EU and, in particular, determine how other measures #can be necessary.
Since it treats  of community companies and that there are proofs of protection concealed by part of representatives of the European Union in said actions of *hostigamiento, how concrete actions have undertaken  to ensure the interests of the companies mentioned? How it goes  to guarantee that they develop freely his activities, with the end to prevent his illicit replacement by other companies and interests and illegal circuits organised?
To combat the violence requires  a double strategy: by a part, is necessary to centre in the structural causes that the cause, is to say, in the attitudes and the masculine behaviours; by #another, is necessary to have of a legislation that forbid #all type of violence against the women, included the domestic violence.
My Group, the Group of the Party of the Liberal, Democrat and European Reformers, feels  firmly engaged with the general concept to develop a capacity of action autonomous European that has been identified aptly like capacity of fast intervention with the necessary logistical support.
At all it shows it with greater clarity that the case of the agriculturalists of bananas *caribeños, that find  among the most vulnerable producers of the world, #whose access to the markets of the EU has been now declared contrary to the regulation of the *OMC, as a result of which confront  to the devastation of his means of life.
In my country, *Finlandia, is already in course a project for the years 1998-2002 on the prevention of the violence exerted on the woman, directed by the Ministry of Health and Social Subjects; also from this point of sight, the approval of the program *DAPHNE has had a big importance.
Considering the deficient confidence in the Union shown, among other things, in the low figures of participation in the elections, and the importance that the EU keep the character of a Union so much of citizens as of States members, think that it is not correct to aspire to the financial autonomy or to the total independence of the contributions of the States members.
The Nordic Green Left (*NGL), composed by the #scandinavian members of the Group *GUE, has voted today in favour of the relative report to the recognition and the execution of resolutions judicial in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, finishes to produce  an extremely important announcement: the process of peace in *Irlanda of North, even with #all the difficulties that have gone  presenting, has given today same a step advance with the decision of the IRE to board negotiations with the Commission for the Disarmament.
In the sector of the agricultural production, in addition to taking into account the principle of caution, it #would be necessary to talk to favour the vicinity of the production to the spots of consumption and to support the regional alimentary chains.
By #this *yo *le ask to the Mr. *Cunha, for example, that in his quality of speaker of the sector of the agriculture take into account also to the sector of the fishing, although the methods of exploitation are basically distinct, #all time that *él also is my coordinator in the Commission of Fishing.
In my quality of speaker general of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer for the negotiations in the frame of the *OMC, *yo want to appreciate very especially the clarity with that has expressed  the Mr. *Schwaiger on the subject of the trade and the environment.
First, our effort for putting in #few pages a series of points of sight shared by a big majority, no only of this Parliament, but also of #european citizens; and, second, for showing *nítidamente that the European Parliament aspires always to be, and in fact is, present in the great decisions, in the great processes that orient  to improve the European Union.
It #would be tragic to advance in the improvement of the European Union, in the improvement of the politics of the European Union, without taking in consideration a so important look, that is directly tied to the daily life, to the life of the #european citizens.
In the session of October, said that the existent contradiction among the enlargement and the consolidation of the EU only #can  resolve #if the Union configures inwardly a model to the mood of the onion or a system of circles concentric.
It thinks the Presidency adopt initiatives to coordinate the positions of the #french Governments and Spanish with the end to abandon definitively #all the projects of development of the network of roads, had account that this solution converts in useless of face to the future the *travesía rail, in particular for the transport of commodities?
Subject: nuclear Head offices in next territories to the European Union To the sight of the grave damages that generated in the European Union the nuclear accident of *Chernobyl, how political proposes  follow the Council to advise to neighbouring countries and cooperate with *ellos in the development of sources alternative of energy?
In how group of work of the Council goes to prepare  the proposal, in a group *ad *hoc with representatives of the ministries of Justice, for example, or in the group of information already existent in the breast of the Council, that in the actuality commissions  to manage the demands of documents?
Subject: Requirements for the inclusion of *Turquía among the countries candidates to the adhesion to the European Union The European Union had denied  to board negotiations of *preadhesión with *Eslovaquia and #some countries *bálticos because they did not fulfil the criteria of *Copenhague referents to the democratic freedoms or the respect of the minorities.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, do not go to characterise of schizophrenic the answer, *me will limit simply to ascertain, as #any one of *nosotros #can ascertain, that the *reforzamiento of the bows among the European Union and *Turquía is a subject of the maximum priority for the Council. So much it is so they leave  to the *margen the budgets that the own Council had posed so that it advanced #that *reforzamiento of the bows.
Therefore, according to the Regulation, have not passed the *veinticuatro necessary hours to proceed to the debate and to the vote. In consequence, wanted to *preguntarle to the President #if also this time go to apply an urgency totally *extrarreglamentaria, because to be like this #can throw the Regulation and decide that #all the urgent subjects #can transact , suffices with agreeing that they are urgent.
Instead, by it that have not struggled and to it that *nos *oponemos of the most forceful form, and besides consider that it puts in grave danger the position of the Parliament and the free mandate, is to that they #can open investigations to deputies chosen freely no only #if they exist suspicions, but also in the case of mere presumptions; to that establish  a system that forces to the delation; to that, in end, here do not treat  of fraud or corruption, but of a general permission bear, quote "to act in case of grave facts tied to the exert of his functions" .
#If it is necessary to create a register of impressions *dactilares, want that under any circumstance mix  to the applicants of asylum neither with the legal immigrants neither with the illegal and will propose that in this diet only take  the impressions *dactilares of those persons condemned for having committed an offence.
In this new proposal says  that the digital prints of the illegal immigrants -because we are talking of the extension of the existent program *EURODAC to the illegal immigrants- will be collected only to apply the Agreement of *Dublín, is to say, only to know #if these immigrants have asked asylum in another Been member of the European Union.
#If well the pretext to create said Office is to exert a control on the civil servants and the deputies of the #european institutions, neither the mood of designation of this Office neither the absence of reference on the mood in that the own Office will be controlled *nos inspires the lower confidence.
Given the no democratic character of the organisms of decision of the European Union, the creation of the *OLAF supposes a totally insufficient measure, allocated to look that it exerts  a control, *cuando do not exists any real and democratic control.
#If well it has to boost and strengthen, in the frame of a system *multilateral, the organisation of a free world-wide trade and juster, also is necessary to procure guarantee to #all the nations, rich and poor -and *me refer, in particular, to the #african countries-, the fact that they #can take out party of the advantages that supposes  will contribute this cycle of negotiations.
The decision to leave the nuclear arms without possibility of immediate disposal and to separate the nuclear heads, is to say, the nuclear arms of the devices that the transport, #can, to #the same time, be the beginning of a serious nuclear disarmament.

#If we observe the European Union and the ethnic conflicts that here exist, included in *algún marry terrorist attempts, *yo believe that #if *nos found in the reverse situation and the Czech Republic already formed part of the Union, surely *le #would say to a determined Been member: fellow #mine, #if they do not resolve *ustedes his conflict, surely will have to expect other twenty years to get to be members.
A possible road to reach a greater balance in the future #would be to adopt a more thematic approach, centring, for example, the attention in the groups that require a special protection, like the women and the boys, or in specific subjects, as for example the observation of elections.
By this reason, #would be recommended that, in the activities of the Union in matter of follow-up and information on the respect of the human rights,  *le give greater weight to the respect of the freedom of expression and to the guarantees and improvement of the rights and possibilities of work of the journalists, for example, *dedicándole to this look a chapter or own section.

Although it has asked  that it expand  the mandate of the Defender of the European Village so that it occupy  also of the claims against the national authorities, especially in cases referents to the freedom of circulation, follow thinking that it is preferable to create an effective system of cooperation with the defenders of the national village and analogous organs.
By it other, the doctrine of the «right of interference humanitarian» -that advances, but has not been recognised by the Nations Joined- #can not  impose by the strength of a powerful armament and complex that goes destroying no only the military whites, but also #all the economic infrastructures of a country.
For *eso is precise to say that the solution was not -as already it has shown - the enlargement of the NATO to the East, but the enlargement of the EU and a politics of associations and economic support that favour the economic and political integration and struggle against the nationalisms *irredentistas.
In place to invent the *Europa of variable geometry, able to offer new perspectives of coexistence inside the cooperation to #all the States of the continent, these #european managers  *obstinaron in following the method *Monet, *erigido in dogma, without giving  account that it no longer was pertinent to gather to the big diversity of countries of the new #european continent.
The method of calculation proposed has to conduct to a situation in the that the modalities of transport less hurtful for the environment reach a higher quota in #all the market of the transport. In this sense, has to be possible correct the principle «the user pays».
It treats  of a field in the that it comprises  well that it manifest  #any doubts on the competition of the European Union taking into account, in particular, the distortions that arise *cuando follow  different criteria of country to country, independently that it was  near or far of the borders, *cuando there are countries in the that the infrastructures are paid by the users by means of the taxation of the fuels and the tolls and #others in that they are it with charge to the public budgets.
Wish before that swims to give the thanks to the Mrs. *Thors, speaker of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of Citizens, and to the Mrs. Towers Mark, speaker of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, because his contribution to the examination of the proposals has been very valuable.
Without embargo, this situation shows that it is necessary to give a jump of quality in the politics adopted with the #african countries, so as to that the promotion of the human rights, the democratisation and the prevention of the conflicts -condition *sine *qua *non for a true development- convert  in essential elements of the cooperation.
By a part, in effect, is quite #likely that the disposals of the Diary 2000 carry to the agriculturalists to reduce his production of *oleoproteaginosas in benefit of the cereals, save, of course, #if they take  wise measures in favour of the crops of the no alimentary sector; on the other hand, in *Europa is diminishing the capacity of production of amino acids, especially of the *lisina of synthesis.
Now it wanted to take a brief comment about the fixation of the prices of the corn in the world-wide market. It #would appreciate to the Commission that *me explained #if the granting of compensations by commercialisation, that is implanting  in the Stadiums Joined, is susceptible to reduce the price of this product.
Gentleman President, taking like base his answer of the Mr. *Eriksson, in the that *usted explained the reasons not to authorise the exhibition *Ecce *Homo here in the Parliament, ask: How it is possible that authorised  an exhibition of a group of pressure #italian that pleaded against the abortion, against of the right of the woman to the abortion?
#If we are able to give stability to our financial position -and are the States members the that they have to take it, and in this sense am very satisfied with the example that has given the Commission and that the Mr. *Fourçans subscribes also in his report- to procure that also in the future believes  more employment and that we #can reinforce our competitiveness in relation with the States Joined #among others.
The Commissioner of *Silguy has proposed that the monetary politics was not an element of the combination of politics, whereas the Commissioner *Monti has referred  to the monetary politics like an important element of the combination of politics.
How it has been of these elements: the codes of behaviour that ask, the review of the statute, the nomination of places To1 and To2 to watch by that have the greater quality in the top of the Commission and the report on the previous control?
As last homage to his work, *me #would enjoy that now the Council, like recognition of the work that has carried out, agreed the changes in the statutes for the agencies of the *segunda generation: changes in the question of the own resources, in the financial control and in the approval of the management that allow to the Parliament exert his committed adequately.
It says , according to a conception that has his origin in the culture of the Communist Party, in a reflection of the sociological left, that, although they exist texts written, #this #can modify #if like this it wants it the majority or a dominant group of the public opinion or of the political strengths.
Gentleman President, the procedure of approval of the management for 1997 and the procedure of approval of the management for 1997 have introduced movement in the cooperation among the institutions and also in the field of the budgetary control, up to now only had it in the field of the budget.
Regarding the reports on the approval of the corresponding management to 1997, the Commission takes note that the Commission of Control Budgetary has proposed the postponement of the approval of the management by institutional reasons related with the resignation of the Commission.
It will have to watch, especially, to resist to the pressures of the that it will be able to be object by part of the Council or of the European Parliament so that it expand his radio of action to fields no established on purpose in the Treaties and for the that, by *añadidura, as we have been able to observe in the recent past, *usted will not have of the administrative or financial means necessary to face up to #the same.
The goals of the negotiation have to require with total clarity in the mandate of negotiation conceded by the Council, with the agreement of the European Parliament, to #whose representatives will have to keep closely informed on the development of said negotiations, to the equal that *sucede in the practice with the members of the Congress of the States Joined.
Already I have enumerated #some points and have not mentioned the transparency, the change of the organisational models, the change in the relations among the Commission and the Parliament, the change in the relations with the administrative structures.
The first observation is in answer to the words of the Mr. *Herman of takes a moment and relative to the fact that *usted there #be decide to subject to approval the modifications of the Annex *V to the Regulation by absolute majority of the deputies to the Parliament; *usted was in it true when proceeding of this way, because it adjusts  to the Treaty.
It is the reason by the that I want to take upsetting, together with our speaker, in that the Court of Accounts is in #all moment in his right to control the compliance of the utilisation of the group of the credits assigned to the budget of the Parliament with the norms in vigour.
It is not of receipt that in answer to the grave conclusions of the annual report of the Court of Accounts on the previous exercise, the Economic and Social Committee have considered inopportune that the *UCLAF have access to this *dossier and commission  to define any possible implication and administrative responsibility, as it demands *insistentemente the Parliament.
It is true that the most visible things are the tragic conditions of the fields, without embargo, his *Señorías, have to know that the immense majority of the deported are received, as #all know, by #albanian families or *macedonias very poor and #one of the greater efforts that are making is the help to the families precisely to avert that they arise social tensions and to avert that, after a month of generous received, are expelled and arise social problems.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0227/99) of the Mrs. *Müller in name of the Commission of budgets on the preliminary draft of state of forecasts of income and of costs of the Parliament and the state of forecasts of income and of costs of the Defender of the Village for the exercise 2000.
The Council did not agree and added the article 99 of the Treaty like juridical foundation as a result of the point of sight of the ministers, that consider that the relative disposals to the annual taxes by vehicle in the Chapter 2 the take a fiscal measure extremely important.
The preparation of a Letter of this type #would be a typical task for the deputies -are the most indicated for *ello and, therefore, have to take it- and our proposal on how has to develop in the practice the Letter of Rights Fundamental will have in any case fully in account this look.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, believe that, in addition to the enlargement, the European Union confronts today the need to give concrete political answers and perceivable by the citizens and -will say more favourable- «» for the citizens, the men and the women of *Europa, concerning a group of problems of the that a lot it depends our future.
It has been missing political will to use in this sense the current Treaties and fear that, finished the «cold war», there #be the one who  *aventure to lose the will of integration political that it is the base of our realisations and of the peace in *Europa.
Like instrument of the politics of market labour and of the development of the human resources, this Bottom goes to be to #the same time a central element of the #european strategy of employment and of an active politics of labour market.
In this frame, have to say that the European Commission moved  in the correct direction in his proposals on the Diary 2000 and wanted to, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European, congratulate by his posture, and also by the that kept during the negotiations, to the Mrs. *Wulf-*Mathies, to the Mr. *Fischler and to the Mr. *Flynn.
Our amendment 2 had by object force to the Commission to review the parameters of the bottom of guarantee in his annual reports, and now, after the political decision, the Commission will have to review the parameters of the bottom of guarantee with each new adhesion.
This fundamental part of the package of the Diary 2000 has the double attribute to be the *primer juridical text arisen of the Diary 2000 that reaches a common position in the Council and, without embargo, is the last in being approved by the Council and the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, also *yo go to talk of the Social Bottom European, but from the point of sight of the external economic relations, for having been *yo the author of the opinion of the Commission of Relations Economic External.
Besides, #if we go in in this dynamics of defence of territorial interests in the that has gone in the European Council in *Berlín, like deputy chosen by the citizens of a concrete zone of *Europa -a region called *Aragón-, neither #can vote in favour of the Diary 2000 because, with this agreement, the citizens to the that represent go out very prejudiced in regard to the current situation.
Since, in reality, these resources #can not obtain by means of the creation of the tax on the CO2 , as they think *Ripa gave *Meana or the Greens, because never it has seen  that the carbonaceous gas produced imposed -of it contrary, the *Pinatubo #would launch probably euros-, only remains, as, a source of resources: the #european tax on the income.
The contradictions of the proposals of the Commission for the restructuring of the fleet that is object of these norms, that demand a national programming by comparison to the regions of the Goal 2 that remain subjected to the regional programming, #would serve only to increase the confusion in other questions.
It is precise *oponerse and modify a clearly discriminatory redesign as it #would be a less favourable formulation of the coastal regions of the Goal 2 in relation with the dependent regions of the fishing of the Goal 1, with it that #would suppress  distant regions of the coast that demand structural finance to support activities of aquaculture and processing.
Gentleman President, did not fits any doubt that the Diary 2000 will bring achieve enormous changes in the European Union, already was for the agriculture or for the regional politics. In this last field, have to admit that *me has produced a deep disappointment the fact that *Irlanda of the North do not appear already inside the Goal 1.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the report (To4-0169/99) of the *Sra *Aglietta, in name of the Commission of Subjects Institutional on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that establish  the modalities of the exercise of the competitions of execution attributed to the Commission (*COM(98)0380 - *C4-0501/98-98/0219(*CNS)).
By a very simple reason: the *comitología is, as #all know, a hell; it is an apparently technical problem, without embargo, in reality, is a deeply political problem because, to end of accounts, treats  of the problem of the control of the execution, of the responsibilities in the control of the execution.
In last place, but no thus less important, appears the procedure *reglamentador. To this *respecto, consider unlucky that after the discussions in the breast of the Council have  *desestimado the proposal of the Commission regarding the return to the Parliament and, often, to the *colegisladores, *cuando a committee have not issued a favourable opinion.
Also I want to express our satisfaction because the explanations and explanations that *nos has provided tonight the Mr. *Marín satisfy fully the claim expressed by the Commission of Subjects External -in the opinion of the that *yo have been speaker- that the Parliament went informed of the evolution of the negotiations before his conclusion.
In this moment, the session of today has a character *nostálgico, because we are at the end of the term of office, and #some of the colleagues will not go back, #others perhaps go back, but, in definite, the current Parliament dissolves , and in this moment there #be a true element *nostálgico, a #twilight environment in this session.
The politicians create the conditions and the suitable climate so that it produce  this growth. The electronic trade has an enormous potential for the #european industry, by it that we have to watch by that it do not adopt  any political decision that force to the providers in Internet to establish  out of the Union.
In consequence, has taken  a technical assistance to the consistent Palestinian Authority in an international squad that goes to work during two years with the #palestinian authorities so as to that it was the Palestinian Authority the that take the responsibility of the management of the hospital.
Of this form, the countries mentioned by the Mr. *Cars perhaps drop in the account that the pity of death really is the worst instrument so that #one #can recover the human dignity. And it is that #all person has to have the opportunity to amend his errors.
To the Commission follows *preocupándole the possibility that the persistence of the restrictions of the fundamental human rights #such as the right of meeting peaceful and the freedom of expression and opinion, have like result a climate of unsteadiness and social agitation in *Malasia.
Afterwards, in the current crisis it is necessary to underline -and neither is of style say it in this enclosure- the responsibility of the Organisation of the African Unit, theoretically commissioned to reconcile to the populations of the Big *Comora and of *Anjouan, after the secession of this last island.
Gentleman President, in 1993, the entrance in vigour of the only market and the dismantlement of the border controls have involved the suppression, in the statements of the VAT, of the statistics of the exchanges of sakes among States members, #whose reliability was guaranteed by the services of customs.
I have voted against of the #european textile market because the proposal is too much protectionist and do not loans sufficiently attention to the importance that the export of products textile and of the preparation *reviste in the poor countries that try to reach the development of his economies.
Possibly it #can result difficult that get to the 626 members, it more logical #would be that #if, truly, exists a report #such, and #if *usted corroborates it, deliver , for example, to the President, to the Table of the Commission of Control Budgetary, and to the coordinators of #all the Political Groups that are represented in the Commission of Control Budgetary.
By it other, *me seems that the designation like representative of the External Politics and of Common Security of the General Secretary of the NATO crimps pretty much the curl and remembers this sentence of a diplomatic French that said that so *ilusorio is to want to take a #european defence with the time like taking the Central Bank European in *Fort *Knox.
The Parliament will have to take use in his whole of his right of audit and of his right of control with regard to the institutions, also included the Commission, but in this difficult situation will have to assume his responsibility in it that concerns to the need that the new Commission #can begin to work it before possible.
I do not want to talk of the nomination of the #german candidate that, in view of the elections, has been a slap, by it that to finalise want to expose a wish: while the dictator *Milosevic was to the control in Serbian do not has to flow neither a peseta neither any euro of the #european taxpayer to Serbian.
Without damage of the management of the Commissioner *Fischler, went almost a reform of the status *quo that did not guarantee the wished balance among agriculturalists, regions and cultures and in the that the #mediterranean agriculture resulted once again abused by the *PAC, did not guarantee the put in practice of the #european model of agriculture, in #whose field did not take  almost swims to help to the small agriculturalists, and, finally, went #few the advances in matter of rural development.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Commission, in the month of January of this year, our Parliament approved the report of the Mr. *Brok that asked that, preferential and mostly, the new Commissioners went members of the European Parliament and persons with experience in the #european Institutions, that guaranteed  a suitable equality among men and women and a just balance of the political tendencies.
To finish, believe that it is indispensable in this occasion encircle no only to the that they will be the facts, taking it with a logic that was not the to move to this Plenary the avatars of the national controversies, but especially take it through a narrower relation among the Institution that *usted chairs and the Parliament.
Some that the creation of an Agency did not resolves of by himself/hisself the problem; without embargo, already will see  how will structure  and will convert  in operative this organism that #would wish that it guaranteed fast interventions, effective, useful, rational and balanced with the just participation in the reconstruction, especially of the that, as #Italia and *Apulia in particular, as a result of the war and of the migratory phenomenons, have seen  prejudiced in economic terms of tourist flows and of global image.
The question is #if the group of the Council is decided, and #if #all *nosotros are decided in a hard period, characterised by the #a lot of competition and by the challenge of a globalisation to #whose height pretend to be to give answer, by a part, to the problems of #all, is to say, to the development and to the *Tercer World, that has truly need of the support of *Europa, and, on the other hand, to accelerate the enlargement.
Without embargo, will result, definitely, more economic for the European Union install it in *Salónica and do not know #if the Commission has taken his duties and has comprised that will pay wages much higher, that there #be not infrastructure in *Pristina, that will see  forced to pay a lot to guarantee the security of his civil servants, that will run danger in an unsure territory.
We think that the Council of Ministers has had reason when subjecting this subject to the Court of Justice of compliance with the article 213 of the Treaty, that forbids to the Commissioners accept, even after the cessation of his functions, put that the #would plant in a delicate situation concerning his obligations in matter of #probity and delicacy.
Finally, we want to review the valid norms on the indications of the initial products, specifically, the norms on the signs that have to carry the labels of the pastures, *piensos or thread mixed, in the sense that, in a future, indicate  the quantity used of initial products used, although no his breakdown according to the different products.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, #if *me allow, wanted to concentrate my intervention in *usted, gentleman President of the Council, because I believe that the European Council has played a very small paper in the #european discussions of the last years and has kept  a so much *distanciado *cuando treated  to take out the chestnuts of the fire.
Without embargo, *yo #would wish to insist to the *respecto, lady Speaker, because in spite of being a lower question, without great consequences for the life of our countries, exist other much graver questions, in #whose case the Commission guides  by #the same extremist mentality, it that it #can involve distortions very grave in the economy of our countries and in the situation of the employment.
#If the Glass of the World resulted a hit also in this plane, #if the number of incidents was relatively limited, *ello obeys to that said control of the *taquilla allowed, for example, that the cooperation *anglo-#french in matter of security was effective with regard to the received, the follow-up and the control of the groups of followers and that averted  #some phenomenons of vandalism, that do not wish that they go back  to repeat in our continent.
My group do not ignores the light trip of the centre of gravity of the Commission to the Parliament that finishes to produce  in the measure that #this confirms in front of the eyes of the public opinion that #can achieve  that they move  the centres to be able to, even those considered like *intocables, which is very important.
In particular, the relations among the European Parliament and the European Commission have to be based in the work and the harmony, to guarantee the maximum possible efficiency in the approval of the key elements of our community legislative requirements.
It has  *rasgado the Letter of the Organisation of the Nations Joined, the international helps, the predominance of the States Joined was the only reason of this war -the affirmation of his geopolitical vision- and has caused worry in the old friends of the States Joined of *América as *Helmut *Schmidt.
*Ustedes Propose an ambiguous answer regarding the Organisation of the Nations Joined, subordinated to the States Joined in the military terrain, in a totally dogmatic condition with regard to the processes of globalisation of the world-wide economy that *merman strongly the #european autonomy.
*Me Odd the fault of a strong speech and original of the Commission in the terrain of the culture, of the communication of mass, of the artistic and cultural production, in that it is posing  a challenge and a simple and deaf resistance by part of *Europa to a North American penetration.
Without the realisation of this deepening in that it assent  the new institutional order that will have to assign to *Europa a paper in the world, *nosotros will not be some effective promoters of the peace and the justice neither will be able to conciliate the needs, sometimes found, of the northeast and #european southwest.
In matter of fiscal politics, in particular, *nos have seen especially disappointed by the feeble conviction expressed by the commissioner proposed in the subject of the development of the coordination of the fiscal diets and of the need to happen to the rule of the qualified majority in the next *CIG.
I have received of the technical Group of independent deputies, of compliance with the paragraph 4º of the article 180 of the regulation, an impugnation of the interpretation proposed by the Commission of Subjects Constitutional to the paragraph 1º of the article 29 of the regulation.
It took a statement that to me *me seemed very *convincente, specifically said: "Yes, we go to respect the principle of subsidiariness, or was, that the first decision corresponds to the States members and to the regions, but in my quality of Commissioner *yo will be the manager that they fulfil  the goals of the regional politics and *me propose to fulfil with my responsibility."
As well, together with our adherents will take all it possible so that our life was it shorter possible, but fear that #this was not sufficient, and therefore, expect that at last the European Parliament and the Commission take to hear his voice, so as to that the elderly of #all the fifteen States members obtain the respect that deserve  and have first of all some norms that *les allow to keep intact the money that pay monthly and *obligatoriamente to have a pension in the future.
But *yo had requested the word, in accordance with the article 122 of the Regulation, to consume a turn of intervention by personal allusions, in relation with the indictments that yesterday took to my person the Mr. *Galeote during the debate of investiture of the President *Prodi.
The Constitutions of the States members, the *CPDH and other treaties already offer sufficient protection to the citizen. So it swims to bank #all type of diets legal, as it proposed the week happened the Minister of the Interior of the Low Countries.
We #can *resumir like this the questions that have formulated  the public opinions: ?In how it contributes *Europa #one *plusvalía and improves our systems of adoption of decisions? ?*Nos Has contributed *Europa an upper economic growth, a greater welfare in the daily life or a hope to take part in a big adventure?
Said of another mood, the object of the next *CIG #would not have to be the to strengthen this institutional process, but, to the contrary, the to lighten it, is to say, limit the competitions of the Union going back to a respectful Common Market of the environment and of the public health.
Gentleman President, the #french delegation of my Group, as also the #danish delegation, already have exposed in the main debate why fundamental reasons #can not support to a Commission that  the gives to be the government of *Europa, without that, by it other, the citizens have approved never explicitly similar statute.
The crisis of confidence of the citizens in the #european institutions that has revealed clearly the abstention in the last elections demands no only "a modern and effective administration", but also new politics that answer positively to the problems *económicosociales that live  in the countries members of the European Union.
The disposal of the Council to modify his proposals concerning the council administration, #can show to the citizens #which is, in fact, the reason of the Council and *cúanto detests to squander, since the realisation of the reconstruction of *Kosovo will be in #a lot of cheaper cases #if it takes  from the region that #if it takes  from the States members.
To finish, will say that until it have not found  a just and global solution to the problem of the refugees, the support of the Union to the *OOPS, like provider of state-owned services in *Cisjordania, *Gaza, the *Líbano, *Jordania and Syrian, is of vital importance to relieve the difficult situation of the 3,5 millions of Palestinians that live in the fields of refugees.
In effect, in a moment in that the international community and #all the world-wide press highlight the importance of the scandal that produces  in *Rusia, have to adopt initiatives to comprise the gravity of said scandal, how explanations gives the #russian Government to these indictments and #which are, by the contrary, our reports on the community finances with *Rusia.
A vision of the cost, the most tragic, is joined to the quantity of lives human that have lost , to families undone, to the psychological shock that have suffered #all the inhabitants of the regions affected by the fear to a possible back earthquake.
Precisely in the times of peace among #Grecia and *Turquía have an opportunity of *acercar jointly here in the European Parliament to the villages of both countries and to surpass at last it that  *me has tried *inculcar and probably also to *ellos in the books of history in the school, to know, that the Greeks and the Turkish hate  reciprocally.
In these moments, the Commission, jointly with other integral of the international community, takes a call to the #russian authorities so that the utilisation of the strength was proportional to the fight in the territory of *Daguestán, #as well as to the operations of persecution through the border *chechena.
The first question is until how point has been funded this building entirely by *Francia and #if it has been really a gift of the #french government because my constituents want to have the security that his taxes, is to say his #dutch taxes, have not come to stop here.
We recognise the importance of a debate in the Parliament on the alimentary security, but the proposal presented was in favour to celebrate a debate with character of urgency on the question of #if a Been member has right to decide by himself/hisself same of compliance no with the community politics, but with it that suits to his own political interests in a moment given.
But had account of the free market, of the open borders and of the practically boundless import, especially #if it proceeds of third countries, is indispensable that impose a series of norms community properly controlled in matter of security and environment, no only inside the European Union, but also in the countries of origin of our foods.
The problem sharpens  even more by the liberalisation of the market, #whose result is the circulation of products no subjected practically to control, #as well as by the competition without limits, that offers to the monopolies the *coartada for the resource even to irregular methods of reduction of costs and increase of benefits, and by the nonexistence of an effective control of the quality, that remains at the expense of the own consumers.
In this context, of course calls the attention that, in relation with the subject of the identification, the States members, but also the Commission, consider the possibility to postpone the identification of the livestock *vacuno and the labeling of the meat until after 1 January of the 2000.
Therefore, *yo #would ask to his *Señorías that do not include  this reference on the modification of the financial perspectives having, very understood, two things: first, that, obviously, anyway the Commission goes to pose a modification of the financial perspectives in the future in the that will take into account no only this element but other elements linked to the subject of *Kosovo.
They know  also the difficulties that hinder the penetration of these energies in a liberal market in the that the energetic resources more traditional are with frequency to a lower price, without forgetting the fault of measures oriented to promote of way *voluntarista the new energies.
The community program *SAVE for the efficiency and the energetic saving constitutes #one of the key elements of the strategy of the European Community in favour of an effective energetic consumption or, it that it is it same, a reduction of the broadcasts of CO2.
It That is in *entredicho is the respect of a fundamental principle of our own survival in the future, that is the of the denominations of origin of our genuine products, protected, by it other, by the World-wide Organisation of the Trade to the protect of the rights of property intellectual.
By means of the agreements of *Wye *River and of *Sharm the-*Sheik, the new political situation in #Israel, a direction of the *OLP decided and a deeper consciousness in the #arab world, has created  a new situation that favours a real and sustainable solution of agreement to the interests of the region.
The new #israeli Prime minister, Mr. #Barak, has formed a Government with a majority it sufficiently wide as for *permitirle restart the negotiations in the process of peace with the necessary parliamentary backrest to his declared intention to go back to promote the process of peace.
The #european contribution to the peace in Orient Next do not manifests  only through the economic and financial help, also consists in following being categorical with regard to the political principles of a just and durable arrangement, in #whose definite solution will finish for leaving a #european print.
On the other hand, it results particularly grave that #can separate  this agreement of the global negotiations of the general agreement, it that #would cause his postponement, with the damages of *ello resultant, and #would seat bad precedents from the point of sight of the defence of the denominations of origin community in the *OMC, in particular regarding the denomination "Port".
It exists a point, without embargo, on the that wish to call the attention so much of our Parliament as of the Council and of the Commission: it treats  of the influence that #can exert this liberalisation of the exchanges, even by a period of ten years, in the economic development of the regions *ultraperiféricas, and in particular of The Meeting, #european territory of full exercise situated near of *Sudáfrica.
This exception to the international regulation, inscribed of irresponsible way in an agreement that links to the European Union, constitutes a dangerous precedent, able to generalise  to other States, specifically to the new producing countries of wines (*América Latin, *Oceanía, #etcetera), #if like this they request it to the European Union.
When denying  to put end to the immigration in *Europa, when denying  to *controlarla seriously, when denying  to impose a systematic detection of the AIDS in the possible immigrants that proceed of these countries of *África, will expose to the Europeans no only to the *seropositividad, but also to #a lot of opportunist illnesses, like the tuberculosis, that had been eradicated of our continent.
This Round of the #Millenium do not has to determine the defensive attitude in front of the North American position in the imports to the European Union of agricultural products treaties with genetic engineering but that the European Union #would have to find partners for his global dynamic strategy.
*Segunda, #can confirm the Mr. *Sasi that the Presidency will present new proposals to facilitate the most complete provision possible to the European Parliament of the documents negotiated in the Committee 133 of the Council, accompanied, in his case, of the special procedures of face to protect the confidentiality?
It do not leaves to be odd that the Commission of *Bruselas, in the moment in that it asks to the States members that give green light to go back to initiate, leaving sideways all it other, a new cycle of commercial negotiations *multilaterales, do not seats the need to take a balance *mínimamente objective of the *OMC, and especially of his device of solution of *litigios.
Obviously, we have to defend the values and the principles that are fundamental for the countries of the Community, without embargo, have to take it of wise and flexible form having always in account that before that at all it is the need to carry forward this fundamental strategic interest for the liberalisation of the international trade to the that *me finish to refer.
We want to avert that they contemplate  *diferenciadamente the classical services of the new -the mood of transfer do not changes at all the nature of a service- and a better access to the market of third States for commodities and services, included the services of telecommunication based in the electronic commercial traffic.
Subject: structural Bottoms The corresponding sums to the structural Bottoms allocated to the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *n1 1 no the delivers the #spanish State in accordance with objective criteria of population and of income by inhabitant, with it that applies  a politics that do not seems to respect the own goals of the #european Bottoms.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, want to say that, regarding the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *nº 1, the #spanish State, in spite of the competitions of the Autonomous Communities, reserves  for politics centralised, no applied in general in the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *nº 1, the 55% of the bottoms that get to the #spanish State.
Second, only it wanted to that *usted confirm #if the Council, against of the will of #one of the States members, #can increase this quantity so that this country #would have to pay more, is to say, that  *le #would force to deposit a greater part of his reservation of currencies in the Central Bank and that there #be not a maximum limit.
The European Union reaffirms  in his disposal to support and boost the process of renewal in *Argelia, especially inside the frame the collaboration *euromediterránea, that involves, among other actions, the immediate resumption of the negotiations on the Treaty of Association of the Countries *Euromediterráneos.
According to the article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union, the Union assent  in a series of principles common of the States members, principles on freedom, democracy, respect to the human rights and to the fundamental freedoms, in addition to the principle of the legality.
Gentleman President, in the first place, have been able to observe personally that the majority of the most important airports follow having big activity in spite of the suppression of the free sales of taxes. And as I indicated in my previous answer, consider that it is function of each Been member take charge of the consequences and other problems, loss of employments in his majority, that the suppression of these free sales of taxes #can involve.
Moratorium for the pity of death - *B5-0144/1999 of the Mr. *Thors, #among others, in name of the Group *ELDR, on the vote of a resolution by the General Assembly of the Nations Joined on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of the capital penalties;
Therefore, I ask to the Council that do not block  with philosophical debates, but that procure that this text contain the mechanisms that *nos allow to continue said battle and that #can , it before possible, conclude the editorial to begin, in the Council and in the Commission -the Mr. *Patten *nos has ensured it-, the task to convince to the 180 States members of the Nations Joined.
As #all know, the European Parliament already showed his sensitivity in this subject *cuando, takes so only some months adopted a decision, collected by the Mr. *Napolitano in the text of his report, that includes articles very concrete on how have to work and #which are the points that have to take in consideration so that the goal of the fight against the fraud convert  in reality.
To #the same time, #would be an omission on my part not mentioning in this moment the big worry and, #if they want to, the contribution of the Commission of Control Budgetary of the European Parliament, that through an opinion, included also in the report of the Mr. *Napolitano, established really bases very solid.
I #can *asegurarles that the Commission is fully conscious of #which is the paper that plays the fight against the fraud in the assessment of the #european politics to the eyes of the citizens and of the citizens and thus I celebrate once again in name of the Commission the report and the work that has made .
We are conscious of the rapidity with that is evolving this system and that the world of Internet, is to say, the world of the users of the society of the information, is very advanced in it *concerniente to the validity of the agreements and the transactions to *través of the electronic system.
And #if, as I estimate, the erosion of the principle of the country of origin looms fundamentally to the only market of electronic services in *Europa -which, to his time, #would constitute an important example for the operation of the electronic trade in our globe-, then the results #would be *tristísimos and *dañosísimos for the citizens of *Europa.
The project of proposal is linked directly to the technical requirements of the Norm 34 of the Economic Commission for *Europa of the Nations Joined, that treats of the prevention of the risk of fire and in particular of the applicable disposals to the deposits of fuel manufactured with plastic.
We have to leave that the States members and the Commission take his proposals and afterwards have to *ocuparnos of #some of the essential initiatives and expose the point of sight of the citizens, the companies, the users of the road and the drivers in #all the European Union.
In the European Union have to *preocuparnos by #all the looks of the security in #all the forms of transport, no only the vehicles of two tyres, or the vehicles of four tyres, or the railways, or the aircraft, or the fuselages or it that it was, but also in relation with the *telecabinas and the facilities of transport by wire.
*Yo Add, besides, that will be precise to include in the Budget 2000 15 millions of corresponding euros to the contribution of the European Union to the initiative of condonation of the debt of the poorest countries that, as #such, has to fund  directly with charge to the Budget, or was, no with pertinent resources of the Bottom of Development.
Our commission considers also that it has to constitute a priority for the Union the provision of informations statistical of high quality, especially now that the Economic and Monetary Union has applied  in the zone of the euro and have already the perspectives of the enlargement of the Union.
Even so, we consider particularly important that have not accepted  the linear reduction introduced by the Council and, especially, that foresee  a moderate increase in the field of the veterinary and phytosanitary costs, to the equal that in the field of the support to the commercialisation.
Gentleman President, the project of budget for the year 2000, 92 *millardos of euros, a *margen of flexibility for this Parliament of 1,5 *millardos of euros had account of it that they are the financial perspectives, linear reductions of #all the credits, or, anyway, agricultural credits, #few ambitions, always the *espolvoreamiento and the *clientelismo budgetary: it is to say, a project of budget without great novelties, and the gentleman *Bourlanges has the big merit to try encourage technically the debate.
The solution of the paradox *nos has been suggested and consists in not accepting that the priorities of morning are funded with the sacrifice and the priorities of today and of yesterday and, in consequence, in funding the new and *irrenunciables priorities of the external actions with a review to the heaves of the financial perspectives of the category 4.
Two final observations: the first is the difficulty to understand and, therefore, to explain, why has , as it has to be, of a juridical foundation to support to the victims of catastrophes natural in any place of the world, as with justice go to take for *Turquía, and do not has  of said foundation bear inside the Union.
The Treaty by the that it establishes  the European Community contains varied disposals allocated to guarantee the democratic responsibility of the #ECB, #one of #whose angular stones is definitely the presentation of the Annual Report to the European Parliament and to the Council of the European Union.
To this normality has contributed, definitely, the fine direction and management of the Central Bank European, and to *él and especially to his President it is necessary *felicitarlos due to the fact that, in the first months of the establishment of the euro, *cuando fixed  the first orientations, had to surpass -and took it with tarpaulin- #some adverse circumstances in some certainly delicate moments to level so much internal like international.
To my mood to see, #this contradicts the article 113 of the Treaty of the EU, that establishes the obligation of the #ECB to present an annual report to the Parliament on his activity and on the economic and monetary politics.
These gentlemen of the Central Bank European comport  like spokesmen of the big *patronal that is, in effect, "reducing the rigidities of the market of the work" , destroying thousands of employments as in this moment in *Michelin, *Renault-*Nissan, *Alsthom, *Rhône-*Poulenc and *Hoest #Marion *Roussel and #a lot of #others, or generalising the precariousness with wages that sink to an increasing part of the population in the poverty while it increases the fortune of the great shareholders.
It do not has power to fix types of interest, any power on the types of change, little can on the public cost, restricted by the Pact of Stability, and #if it was in the hand of #many of the members of this Parliament, any power on the own fiscal types.
The union of the two wallets of development and humanitarian help increases the possibilities to reach this goal, especially #if we take into account the fact that so much the field of work of THROW like the field of competition of the responsible commissioner of the politics of development are global.
Regarding the actions in matter of fight against the drug for the period 2000-2004, the Council now *nos urges to approve to #all haste this document whereas, as it admits the own Commission, has not taken  any systematic and rigorous assessment of the presumptive results of the previous plan.
It has talked to "open" the Council to the public scrutiny and to study other reforms, and has expressed his hope that the #finnish Presidency leave a durable print in the Union in this sense.
Nevertheless and said was of step, is true that the special situations demand a special effort -and was necessary a special bottom to cover this special effort- so that they are not the projects already in course the that they go to pay the special situations, as it seems that it exists now the risk that it was *África the that go to pay the efforts that the *EU will take in *Kosovo.
To #the same time, want to ask to the Presidency of the Council that, of compliance with the document of the Commission, in the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental open  the possibility to present an own proposal to apply of a reasonable mood some methods of work.
#All these actions and other more that affect to the security of the citizens of the European Union, have to be undertaken on the base of the full respect of the fundamental rights of #that that live in the territory of the Union, because the key of the future space of freedom and security are precisely the fundamental rights *irrenunciables.
Gentleman President, for the very cold and rational heads the year 2000 is of course a year like #another #any one, but no only the no romantic #can embezzle to the start of a new century to #one some magic, to elevate the head above his own activities and adopt in front of his own future *algo #as well as an attitude of project.
This Council of Wise persons do not devotes neither a critical word to the second and *tercer *pilar of this democratic non-existent country of the cooperation among the Governments neither neither makes any proposal to link it to a #european democratic reform.
In my opinion, when developing a frame of reference #european for the utilisation of the digital signature, the European Union always has to act also to international level so that the legal guidelines of the system are ratified.
By #this a concrete principle to justify the intervention of the Union in this matter is the of the possible social insecurity that #can produce the restructurings of companies inside the Community and, was as it was, inside the States members, a principle that, on the other hand, already was foreseen in the Treaty of Blunt of 1957.
Gentleman President, when refusing the Treaty of prohibition of nuclear proofs, the American Senate has taken an irresponsible gesture assuming to #the same time the responsibility to put to the world in front of the serious danger of the nuclear holocaust.
These strengths are #the same that follow *perpetrando the pity of death and not paying the quotas owed to the Nations Joined contributing of this way to the loss of legitimacy and functionality of an organism that has like constitutive element the right of the villages to rid  of the wars.
This attitude of the Senate of the #EE.UU is in contradiction with the final statement of the *CTBT that, as *usted gentleman President of the Council has mentioned, has gathered  in *Viena of the 6 to 8 October underlining the importance of a global and verifiable prohibition of the nuclear essays and urging to #all the States to sign and ratify with rapidity said Treaty.
But perhaps it #can go a bit more far and affirm that it really hurtful for the European Union #would be #if, after having reaffirmed the cause in favour of an external politics and of common security, after having defended the cause of an initiative by the security and the defence, *nos remained short in it that take regarding our rhetoric.
Of Compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0026/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of Council (13328/2/1998 - *C5-0023/1999 - 1998/0169(*COD)) with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  an only instrument of finance and of programming of the cultural cooperation (Program "Culture 2000" ) (Speaker: Mr. *Graça *Moura).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0024/1999) of the Mr. *Gargani, in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the proposal of decision of the Council (*COM(1999) 111 - *C5-0019/1999 - 1999/0066(*CNS)) relative to the community participation in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector.
It was constituted in the month of October of 1989, under the auspice of the program *Eureka Audiovisual, acts in the frame of a partial agreement reached in the breast of the Council of *Europa and among his members has 34 #european members and the Commission of the Union *Europa in his group.
To personal title, without embargo, want to say that the third amendment did not have my approval, in the sense that, in the text *originario, the decision that #be to approve and that the Commission already has anticipated, had to expire the last day of the last month of the *quinto year, while the Commission has reduced this term to three years.
Without wanting to question the authority of the president of the commission that finishes to take part and to the sight of the appeal of the greater parliamentary Group, meeting wiser act with greater prudence because, as it has shown , did not fits doubt that the necessary absolute majority converts, at least, in difficult the vote.
I expect of the capacity of the gentleman Commissioner, of the attitude of the Commission, of our Council and of our Governments, that conclude  *felizmente an agreement that allow, on the one hand, continue with our activity *pesquera and, by the #another, why no, that *Marruecos and the #moroccan citizens benefit  of this privilege that have when administering some waters that have a bank *pesquero so important.
The European Parliament, in the amendments that presents the Commission of Fishing, asks to the Commission that follow the subject, that inform to the Parliament and to the Council, at least three months before the expiration of the agreement, so as to have the security of his continuation.
In this moment, since it has modified  the juridical foundation -and east is the reason of the new regulation- and the procedure that has to apply  no longer is the of the article 37, or was, the of query, but the of the article 152, or was, the of *codecisión, the Parliament has the duty and the responsibility to reduce this term of the 2003.
A technical analysis allows to get to the conclusion that the *desaceleración of the tendency of growth in the European Union explains  by a combination of crashes external, amplified by divergences of the national politics, in a context of rigidity structural.
The unification of the coins has induced the unification of the financial politics; the of the financial politics, the unification of the economic politics; the of the economic politics, the unification of the social politics.
The #finnish Presidency also pleads by the transparency in this subject, although the point of game was the confidentiality; #this, to his time, is owed in big part to that each *dialogante talks of his own subjects and of his specific field without pretending get to common agreements, but that it that looks for  is the mutual understanding.
In the marine sector, with the amendment *nº 6 have examined the question by extensive and in depth to try give with a formulation that guarantee the achievement of a collective agreement that offer the maximum flexibility allowed by the directive, is to say, the annual computation of the labour day.
The Parliament had asked that it take into account that the air conditioned or another additional squad #can increase the pollution. That the juridical responsibility of the manufacturer and of the distributors has to delimit of form more precise and that, therefore, included  the cars of directors and the vehicles with permission of circulation of a day.
The collateral effects and the adaptation of the actions will base  in his greater part in the frame of the inner market that the Commission formulates two times to the year and in the report of *Cardiff on the operation of the markets of products and capitals.
As half against the unemployment the report mentions also the increase of the capacity of adaptation of the companies and to this *respecto is precise to ensure, for example, through minimum standards, the participation of the workers, the information and query of #the same in the timely time and, with #this, his possibility to adapt  to the change.
The project of the *UEM creates unemployment, and regarding the active labour politics is obvious that #this presupposes local and national initiatives by the reason that the labour markets of the community countries are organised of form so distinct among himself/hisself that results of the all impossible put in practical any #another measure that are not the normal measures and no *vinculantes included in the existent proposals.
*Yo Expect proposed like #this of the new Commission, knowing, gentleman President, that in this moment will find the social object of the Union, is to say, a greater social wealth and a no based employment in partial measures but in an economic development and in some fully profitable and reliable companies.
The high taxes, the social redistribution of the income and a politics *salarial *inflexible #be to conduct to the societies to a situation degraded, in the that the work no longer is for the individual a stimulating alternative from the point of sight economic.
Like this and #everything, in the *mundialización of the markets, *Europa runs the risk to suffer the competition of the great economies that invested and invest more in the diffusion of the technologies and in the investigation, #as well as in the professional training of the youngsters, #this is, in the future of the most advanced industries technologically.
Report (To5-0049/1999) of the Mr. *Gahrton, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Popular Republic of Chinese (*COM(1999) 287 - *C5-0038/1999 - 1999/0123(*CNS))
Report (To5-0047/1999) of the Mr. *Linkohr, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that celebrates  the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Argentinian Republic (*COM(1999) 292 - *C5-0040/1999 - 1999/0125(*CNS))
Lady Speaker, believe that the proposal that has taken the Table is the best solution in this case, is to say, that the debate on *Chechenia celebrate  of the 15.00 to the 16.00 hours because like this, in place to interrupt the debate on the conference *intergubernamental, will begin the session of the afternoon on said conference an hour later, believe that, of this way, will be able to debate the two subjects more correctly.
To continuation, have the proposal of the Mr. Baron *Crespo to suppress the hour of questions to the Council, proposal varied by the Mr. *Leinen, that asks that this hour of questions celebrate  during the nocturnal session, after the institutional debate, it that *me seems to coincide with the criterion of the Mr. Baron *Crespo.
Lady Speaker, the Parliament already has voted a resolution to the *respecto, but today poses  a problem: the World-wide Bank has to pronounce *próximamente on the relevance of the project, and think that, given the projection that has on the villages of #Chad and of *Camerún, #would be very received a message of the European Parliament.
The first proposed of the Commission is of May of 1998, and in the last 18 months the procedure survived no only to a change of base legal, but also to a change of the Treaty, to a change of *comitología, to a change of the Parliament and to a change of the Commission.
With that have seen the apparition of organisations criminal devoted to the sale of boys, mothers to the that *les steal the children, mothers to the that bribe so that they separate  of his children, mothers to the that *engatusan *diciéndoles that the boy goes to enjoy of a good beginning in the life and afterwards return with his family, *cuando, of course, did not exists this intention.
The question that, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, want to take to the lady Commissioner that, on the other hand, has shown #a lot of sensitivity to these subjects, is the following: *Nos #can say #which are the conflictive looks of the question and the reasons by the *cuales has not presented  a proposal reviewed still?
Likewise, #if we decide to transfer the competition, put by case, of the cooperation for the development of the States members to the European Union, believe that we #can reach *muchísimo more in the world with #the same quantity of money and #can increase our resources without thus increase the fiscal charge that *recae on the citizens of the European Union.
But it that still lacking and it that still has not reached the ancient Commission and that expect reach  at last, is a #european directive in the that no only regulate  technically the feeding of the current *proveniente of sources of renewable energy but also that, in accordance with the right of competition #european, specify  the moods on how #can boost  *contractualmente in the Community a current produced in this way.
It exists coincidence in considering that the conservation of energy, the rational planning and the renewable energies constitute the most important form, apart from the tax to the CO2, on the that, as I already have said, has not got  still to an agreement.
*Me Go to refer now to the part *jocosa of the subject: the *UJD, the #slovakian authority supervisor of the nuclear facilities, did not concedes already from 1995 the usual permission of service for varied years but only a provisional extension of a year with the purpose to force to the *explotadores to make the necessary modernisations.
High gentleman Representative, did not fits doubt that the institution of his charge and in particular his nomination has created great expectations in this sector of the public opinion - that create majority - that thinks that *Europa has to endow of an external politics and of common security #if it wants to, as *usted has said, be credible further of the commercial exchanges or of the economic gigantism.
Surely it will coincide the Mr. #Solana *conmigo #if *le say that the dip that *nos have traced those who today have #any greater or lower responsibility in the process of integration #european #would take *palidecer the most optimistic ambitions of the #european leaders of *cuando, for example, *usted chaired the Council of Subjects General of the European Community.
The goal of the debate of today is *clarificar and evaluate, from the point of sight of the European Union, the global approach of the to scale world-wide negotiations and situate it in the political context of a global strategy.
The increasing tendency to the fusion of companies that develop activities of transnational character and the impotence of the national States in front of the constitution of monopolies, oligopolies and cartels put in danger the goal of the world-wide trade to contribute to the welfare and the peace all over the world.
Besides, also it is particularly important that have clear that the *aminoración of the growth of the world-wide economy also saves relation with the unsteadiness of the international financial system, that characterises  by enormous and swift financial transactions to scale world-wide and, although it has  *desgajado of the world-wide economy, without embargo *repercute on the investments, the growth and the employment.
Second, that fix  rules of common game to #all with respect of the matters at present no treated or insufficiently treated by the Agreement of *Marraquech, examples of the *cuales are the sanitary hygienic-modalities, the environmental effects and of health of some methods of production intensive or the respect of the sensitivity of the consumers.
#This is particularly important, since #many of the subjects, especially the new -#a lot of colleagues have signalled it already- have a strong emotional charge, as, for example, the question of the links of the investments to a new regulation of the competition and to the social and labour norms, but also #many #others.
But it is in the haste of the that gives proof and to the that the report *Schwaiger takes reference with #a lot of obstinacy #where reside the reasons to raise legitimate suspicions, especially #if it wants to remember  that these same principles finish to see  ridiculed in the recent files of the banana, of the *OGM and other meats of *vacuno with hormones, in the *cuales the defeat of the European Union through the Commission is so discreet like fast.
*Rusia -And #this results particularly painful for the #european left- did not constitutes an exception in this sense, but that acts, to his mood to see, exactly the same that it took it the NATO in *Yugoslavia and *me seems an opportunism of the worst class that those who have applauded to the Mr. #Solana to first hour, applaud now the intervention of the Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit.
It will have reached, in the final act, a quotation on the principle of caution, in the sanitary look, even in the phytosanitary, a forum *OIT-*OMC, a recognition of the environmental principles, in the measure that have been already recognised in *Kioto.
In these decades, in these last *lustros, the international trade -*Europa is the homeland of #David #Ricardo- has allowed, thanks to a new international division of the work, generate wealth and inclusion, #as well as win a poverty that, with the increase of the population and without the international trade, #would be much graver that the current.
The education, the health, the public and social services, the public transports, the culture , are #others *tantos sectors that #can not put in the scales of a commercial negotiation and #can not depend of a court of trade international.
But the next cycle of negotiations has to tackle also new subjects: the development, the environment, the health and the sanitary security, the fundamental social norms, the competition and transparency of some minimum rules in matter of investments and the promotion of the cultural diversity.
It has got the hour, without embargo, to be able to send parliamentary representatives to #all the meetings and to take part in the *CIG, in our quality of institution community, in equality of conditions that the Commission to defend our positions and our proposals and, in his case, *rebatir the proposals that present #others.
The Commission, with the power of orientation, the new authority, recognised to his President, #would have to preserve -will not be easy, *permítanme say it, now that am inside the Commission- his school character, his efficiency, his form of decision by simple majority of the members that the compose.
It takes lacking to integrate, for example, the functions of the Western European Union in the Union to avert new *Kosovos, but also boost the coordination of the economic politics, the fiscal harmonisation and the creation of an authentic *Europa social and of the employment that *nos allow to confront the worries of the citizens.
This lack  self-evident with special virulence in the point of intersection among the Economic Union and the Monetary Union, by a part, and in the point of intersection among the Political Union and the Economic and Monetary Union, by #another.
Like this *me allow *recordarle #one of the looks that with #a lot of tarpaulin has stood out the Mr. *von *Boetticher, to know, the package of proposals also has to foresee that in the general and essential part of the Treaties establish  a frame that define clearly the competitions of the European Union.
In this context, the Council wishes to remember the conclusions that issued on 25 May 1994 related with the nuclear security in the production of electricity of the countries of *Europa Central and of the East, #as well as in new independent states, in the *cuales the Council expressed his posture in front of this question.
All citizen of the Union, #as well as #all physical or juridical person that reside or have his social domicile in a Been member, will have right to access to the documents of the European Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission, with arrangement to the principles and the conditions that will establish  of compliance with the sections 2 and 3.
The Council, with arrangement to the planned procedure in the articulate 251, will determine the general principles and the limits, by reasons of public or private interest, that regulate the exercise of this right of access to the documents, in the term of two years from the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, only want *indicarle and *asegurarle to the Mr. deputy to the Parliament that the Council is perfectly conscious of the need to simplify and take more effective the mechanism of finance of the Countries and Territories of *Ultramar, but, as I already have said, by the moment  *nos has sent only a communiqué, in the that they present  three possible models of performance.
#If it is not possible to vote on the report today, it better #would be that we asked to the services of the Parliament #if it is not possible to sustain this debate today in the afternoon and vote the Wednesday of the partial period of sessions of December, it that *nos #would allow to communicate the results to the Council before the Thursday; we #can ask also to the Commissioner that took part about the Council in relation with this question?
Thus, in my opinion #would have been preferable to resort to the original proposal of the Commission of Control Budgetary contained in his opinion directed to the Commission for Constitutional Subjects, in the that excludes  #all this group of questions and only regulate  the rights and obligations of the deputies.
Also there #be a concrete reference in the preamble to the Protocol on privileges and immunities, and a reference to the fact that the pertinent article #can not go in detriment of the requirements of confidentiality that #can fix  concerning the deputies of the European Parliament.
Now well, although it was necessary to expect to that it finalise the cycle of negotiations, to be able to express a trial on the bottom in relation with the results obtained, it true is that, regarding the frame, the global result #can not consider totally negative #if the #european nations #can obtain a regulation more *vinculante of the international norms in matter of competition.
Regarding the point 27, think that it has been a big advance that the called tasks *Petersberg of the document of Colony (humanitarian actions and of rescue, actions for the maintenance of the peace and actions armed in relation with the handle of the crises, included the measures for the maintenance of the peace) incorporate  to the own tasks of the EU.
The fact to demand today the immediate and unconditional abolition of the pity of death in the whole world, means no only promote the human dignity, but also give a sense to the Universal Statement of the Human Rights.
By the contrary, the pity of death is the weapon preferred by the totalitarian diets because it constitutes a symbol of the power of the state and of the humiliation of the individual in front of the state power; and we know, besides, that is used to annihilate to the opponents.
Thus, we think that #if the European Union did not condemns and puts remedy to this criminal behaviour, the conclusions #would be obvious: in the first place, the European Union #would convert  in accomplice of the slaughterings of #serbian and #gipsy organised by the criminal bands and *mafiosas of the *UCK; second, it #would show  that there #be two *varas to measure in Occident; and in *tercer place, #would say  that the goal of the intervention was to destroy to the #serbian village.
Finally -besides, of course, to loan a very special attention to the *TPI bear *Rwanda-, so that it do not forget  this conflict, that already seems very far, too much far for #some, the paper of the European Union consists, in my opinion, in being present beside the #rwandan village in this occasion.
Although it was not very revolutionary and although the step forward was too much small, have the hope that it allow to compare *bad *practices splitting of some reliable data and that feels the bases for a politics of drugs human and effective in the frame of a European Union integrated.
Our problem in the actuality is the existence of youngsters #whose life in family is fine but that to #the same time feel that his existence is so empty that need a tablet or a *tripi the Saturdays in the discotheque and like this reach *entonarse with the help of a drug on the that  *les has induced to think that it is *inofensiva.
It wanted to congratulate to the Mrs. *Giannakou by his valuable report, and by the importance that concedes to the international cooperation and to the consolidation of the annual systematic meetings of the council *interinstitucional, for a better follow-up and assessment of the actions, #whose main goal is to achieve the decrease of the offer of substances *estupefacientes.
I will not be able to forget never that a time, *cuando was responsible minister of the fight against the drug, went to visit to a youngster that had lost the health, his friendships, his relations, his family, his placing, his perspectives and even the respect of himself/hisself same.
With his reduced expectations of the payment of the interests of the owners of his capital and like this his possibly reduced *gearing *rate, #this is the relation among the volume of loans concerning the own capital around the 2,5 -*cuando the *ratios in the market usually surpass the 10- the bank enjoys of big confidence in the markets of capital.
The speaker and the Commission of Budgets stand out especially that the projects of the Bank have to support important goals, #among others, decisions of the European Parliament as, for example, in matters #such as the fight against the poverty and the protection to the democracy, to the human rights and to the environment.
As I have said before, gentleman President, the Commission of Subjects Juridical approved by unanimity the regulation, but proposes a series of amendments allocated to signal that the article 299.2, that already is in vigour, establishes an additional base for the proposal of regulation of the Commission.
The worry that this modification has caused in Canarians -and of the that *nosotros *nos take echo- has grown in #the same measure in that it goes arising #one some distrust regarding the capacity of the own Government of my country to comprise the true entity and gravity of this problem and regarding his will to confront  to #the same in the referred negotiation with the Commission.
The report suggests that the States Members and the forums #FMI World-wide Bank take measured to verify #if the conditions and the suppositions under the that it has conceded  to *Corea the package of rescue directed by the #FMI have respected  in his whole in the case of the dockyards.
In July of 1999, the Ministry of Transports and Communications of *Finlandia even notified to the Commission the program of bonuses of interest conceded to the naval acquisitions, #whose goal was *fomentarlas acquisitions and the repairs of fuselages of respectful charge with the environment and insurances, essential in the conditions of the north, #where have to displace among the ice.

The effort for examining relative obvious questions to the human rights in the EU is very partial Why has the discrimination by reason of race or of ethnic origin a deal of favour and, for example, the discrimination of the women and of the homosexuals do not mentions  or hardly takes ?
And #this is the background of these relative proposals to an assignment of bottoms during a period of three years enciphered in 15 millions of euros for the set up of the adoption of the *acervo normative community and the consolidation of the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía and in 135 millions of euros for the development of the economically retarded regions of *Turquía, respectively.
Gentleman President, believe that it that proceeds in this case is to congratulate to the Mr. *Morillon by the realisation of these reports, that has had to take in circumstances very difficult, with a big haste of time, and believe that it has taken  creditor to the recognition of #all: like this it has seen  *recompensando with the vote that has produced  in the Commission of Subjects External.
Like the planned quantities for the year 1999 were not *presupuestadas, it #would be necessary to prolong -to *ello has referred  today the speaker- the budgetary frame of the program in a year, until the year 2002, and it #would be necessary to include the credits of the year 1999 in the project *rectificativo and supplementary.
The Union has to ensure that #all the countries candidates -included, of course, *Turquía- will respect the international treaties and the international right, will cooperate with the neighbouring countries by the peace and will resolve his eventual differences respecting the international right and resorting to the international instances of justice, like the Court of The there #be.
It do not has felt to affirm that only *cuando *Turquía have given determined steps, perhaps *le will give an affirmative answer. The usual reaction of *Turquía is to retort that, to the sight that *Europa do not fulfils his promises, do not have a clear #european perspective and, therefore, #can not undertake the risky path of the reforms.
The sustainable harmonisation, from the point of sight of the *Báltico, of the ecological needs, of a viable agriculture, of the industrial politics, of the use of zones *vacacionales and of #the same enlargement supposes, obviously, a big challenge so much to administrative level, as to political level.
The incorporation of the #nordic and #mediterranean countries to the European Union has been the main reason that it pose  the update of this directive, at present in vigour, that regulates the commercialisation of seeds and forest plants and that from 1975 had not been modified substantially.
#If well in these last months the evolution of the value euro/dollar has been *desfavorable for the euro, *ello no only obeys to the existent current difference among the North American and #european economies from the point of sight of the dynamism and of the performance.
Like speaker, believe that it is just to recognise that the initial proposal of the Commission improved to a large extent the *OCM current, especially when reinforcing the fundamental paper that the organisations of producers have in the commercialisation of the products and to the *otorgarles more and better mechanisms for the correct operation and to exert a fishing and a more responsible commercialisation.
This proposal on the common organisation of the market in the sector of the products of the fishing and of the aquaculture *reviste a central importance for the politics of fishing common in the European Union.
I will signal to the Assembly that, in said agreement on the Union *aduanera, the European Union is the that has resulted benefited -and *sobradamente- by the commitments subscribed, since the balance of the commercial scales among the European Union and *Turquía has duplicated  in favour of the European Union, from the application of these agreements.
In *tercer place, in the next agricultural negotiations #would have to occupy a central place the *multifuncionalidad of the #european model of agriculture, in concrete, a greater development of the rural space, the production of products agricultural of quality, environment even in relation with the article 20 of the agreements of the *OMC on the agriculture.
Therefore, #ours main mission follows being political and no technical, to know, reopen the public cause in favour of a greater liberalisation of the trade, no only in benefit of the companies and the #european consumers, but especially because the open trade is the only viable solution on a long-term basis to struggle against the poverty in the world in development.
The first was an obsessive reference to the substantial reduction of the internal supports to the agriculture, without that had  *mínimamente in account the diversity of the productive structures of the different countries and neither an objective classification and *homogénea of the diverse types of subventions conceded to the agriculture;
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Court of Accounts, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, the utilisation of the fiscal resources with arrangement to clear political priorities, according to the principles of the saving and of the efficiency, are the goals that #would have to impose #all the that they have to see with a public budget. #Such is the goal that has imposed  the new Commission.
For *nosotros, the European Parliament, the achievement of a #european consciousness, a #european identity, the respect by the diversity of cultures, tongues, ideas and religions, is in his group *indivisiblemente tied to a politics of training #european aggressive.
Through the soup and with the help of the program *SOCRATES, the result of this project was an increase of the motivation of students and personal, a greater sensitisation of his own surroundings, #as well as of other places and a greater knowledge of the technology of the communications.
Gentleman President, finishes to appear in the press and have checked it in the Commission of Fishing. It treats  of the fishing of cod in the Atlantic northeastern and, besides, of a bilateral agreement among *Rusia and Norwegian, two states that together with #others like the European Union, *Islandia and *Polonia are parts in equality of rights in the Commission for the Fishing in the Atlantic Northeastern.
The present report on verification of *credenciales, therefore, refers  to the results of the *quintas elections to the Parliament celebrated of the 10 to 13 June past, and bases  in the official communications of the distinct States members on the group of the electoral results, included the names of the possible substitutes and the order of *prelación resultant of the vote.
Thus, the #spanish delegation of the Popular Party European estimates necessary to keep in the Plenary the relative amendments to the *primer paragraph of the section 2 of the article 3 and to the last paragraph of the article 21, in the that concretise  the exceptions and conditions for the use of the bromide of methyl after 2006.
The limit of the 1% in any ingredient -that as  *nos has informed to me and to #others already is being surpassed by the supermarkets, #among others, like requirement for alimentary products- is besides a limit that, as I have been able to know, #can fulfil it easily #any one that wish to avert that in the label of the alimentary products appear the indication that they contain organisms genetically modified, owing to the adventitious pollution, that go *usted to know it that *eso means.
We expect that it recognise  to the European Parliament the right of *dictamen satisfied on the modifications of the Treaties and follow supporting the proposals of *Dehaene, *Weizsäcker and *Simons, in the sense that it #would be hit to establish a fundamental Treaty and a Treaty expanded, so as to that the citizens of *Europa #can know how field will be competent in each case and how will configure  the European Union in the century *XXI.
Although *me seat satisfied, and with reason, by the fine qualities of direction of the Government of *Finlandia and because in the great groups of questions, or well have achieved  great progresses, or well have resolved  entirely his subjects, is evident that the fine results of this period derive  of the will of #all the Union to develop a #european common structure.
We go to take a review, a Conference *Intergubernamental another time, without a community method, without a paper for the Commission, with an insignificant paper for the European Parliament, without contact with the national Parliaments and, finally, without transparency neither responsibility in front of the civil society.
Gentleman President, am particularly satisfied, of course, with the confirmation by the Council of the already proposed position by the relative Commission to that the enlargement of the European Union was a process in the that #all the countries of *Europa Central, that have presented  like candidates, are involved, without any distinction, in accordance with his own merits.
His *Señoría has to know definitely that the authorities of *Belgrado are trying *presionar to the international community so that they raise  the sanctions against the *RFY and reconstruct the bridges destroyed when putting like condition for the reopening to the navigation of the #serbian sections of the *Danubio the to receive assistance of the international community to reconstruct the bridges.
In first reading, my Group pronounced  against any reduction of the credits assigned to ancient but always important priorities -and especially of the credits allocated to the cooperation and to the development of the countries of the south- to fund these new costs: never it has been a good sign of political creativity undress to #one to dress to #others.
Gentleman President, in the first reading of the budget, the European Parliament pronounced  clearly in favour of a review of the Agreement *Interinstitucional, so as to be able to answer to the derivative obligations of the Agreement of fishing, of the help to *Kosovo and to *Timor Oriental, and of the support to the victims of the earthquake.
Also they are steps in the correct direction the initiatives of the Commission on the plans of action of the Community and the proposal that is elaborating  about the development of the system of the trade of waste and material *contaminantes inside the Community.
I will say simply that the conferences on the *recalentamiento of the planet are #all equal, because the question that #can *formularnos is: "how many natural designated catastrophes there will be still that expect to take really in consideration the effects *nefastos of the *recalentamiento of the planet and, especially, his consequences in the economic and social development of our societies, here in *Europa, but also was, in the rest of the world?"
By it that *atañe to the participation of the European Parliament, have to recognise that from takes years the European Parliament has been no only the locomotive of the sensitisation, of the #european public opinion and international, but also the locomotive of the decisions, is to say, has influenced in decisions of the Council and of the Commission.
Report (To5-0081/1999) of the Mr. *Valdivielso of *Cué, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of regulation (*Euratom, *CE) of the relative Council to the granting of assistance to the New Independent States to *Mongolia in his effort of reform and economic recovery (*COM(1998)753 - *C5-0038/1999 - 1998/0368(*CNS))
The European Union, that had prepared  very well for the discussions and #whose position has been very coherent, has not yielded regarding the agenda that wished that it approved , to know: a wide agenda, that did not limit  only to the agricultural questions and to the services, as they wanted the States Joined.
I do not question the big capacity of the Mr. #Martin to chair with celerity our works, but that -to the equal that other colleagues of this Parliament- report a practice that, to be general, consider, without embargo, totally contrary to the letter of our Regulation and to the spirit of the parliamentary institutions.
The #german Government has conformed  with hiding  after the skirts of the French during #all this controversy, throwing the fault to the complexities of his system of government federal to postpone the lifting of the embargo in *Alemania.
Today, in spite of that asked  to the Commission of Agriculture and to the Commission of Environment of this Parliament that examined the possibility of this extension and to that the amendments proposed were practical and reasonable and #can have  approved with arrangement to the *codecisión, the Council has decided to overlook this Assembly and change the juridical foundation for this decision.
The question of the identification of the products of meat of bovine and the certainty that they are reliable is so fundamental for the divergence among *Francia and the European Union like the worries by the *inocuidad that have warmed up in the two last years the Commission of Agriculture and the Commission of Environment.
In effect, have to say that seldom I have seen a budgetary procedure of this nature, in that up to now- and until this positive statement, that allows to close the agreement -*nos found still in front of two lists of possible votes: a list taken in accordance with the Council and a list established on the base of a fault in accordance with the Council.
In this context, receive with satisfaction the new proposals presented by my colleagues of the Socialist Group for the creation of a #european court for small claims, with the end to help to the persons to face up to the damages caused owed by clashes in the breast of the EU.
Gentleman President, every time that hear to talk in this Parliament of the deprivation of rights human basic, like the right to vote and the right to present  to some elections, #would have to serve for *fortalecernos in our determination in promoting and promote the democracy in #all the parts of the world.
The employment of the resources of the structural bottoms no spent in the period of programs 1994-1999, by against, #can not take in consideration, since the available resources already have been assigned to determined measures, and besides, in this concrete case, in narrow collaboration with the competent #french authorities.
In this context, the Council believes that the task of the regional politics consists in developing #all the potentials to compensate the disequilibriums and *atrasos structural and accelerate the economic and social transformation in the less favoured regions, included the islands.
It is evident that this report do not requires more comments by part of this Commission and even do not has to have more comments of *ella, but that it is rather a subject for the next President of a new Commission that definitely will take advantage of  *gustosamente of so rich experience reflected in *él -the experience of the Mr. *Herman the one who, as have understood, with this report and political will in fact sacks  of the European Parliament-.
*Cuando Examine the environmental consequences and the challenges of the enlargement no *nos will encourage for imposing to these States that want to add to *nosotros in the process of appeal #the same type of projects environmental disastrous that often have adopted during the 40 last years by mere ignorance of our Union.
It is not a chance that both institutions have like fundamental goal the defence of the rights of the citizens and, thus, this collaboration has to continue guaranteeing, of conjoint way, these rights and the democratic work of the Union, *proporcionándole to our administration a greater credibility.
It takes little time, precisely the Mr. *Newman chaired a delegation of the Commission of Requests -in the that were the mates #Laura of #Esteban and Barbaric *Schmidbauer- to *Doñana in a trip that wanted to attend precisely to the worry of the citizens, that had expressed  in numerous requests to the Commission of Requests, by the natural space, that is reservation of the biosphere, of *Doñana.
The Commission is convinced that, with the institution of the Defender of the #european Village, the #european citizenship has enriched  considerably and that the fine administration of the #european Institutions, the transparency and the equity of his operation are right fundamental of #all the citizens of *Europa.
Therefore we agree with the excellent report of the Mrs. Of #Esteban #Martín *cuando invites to #all the #european Institutions to sensitise even more, #if it fits, to the citizens with #all the possible means on the possibilities that they have to take cost his rights and, in particular, obviously, on the possibility to direct  to the Defender of the Village.
How #can struggle  against the fiscal fraud and the delinquency organised or protect the financial and budgetary interests of the Union, #if the different computer systems *aduaneros follow without being interconnected, in spite of the possibilities that offer the program Customs 2000 or the program GONE for the computerisation in the sphere *aduanera?
With #all security, the paramount paper in this attempt has to have it the European Union that, in collaboration with the General Secretary and with the Council of Security of the Nations Joined, will proceed to the necessary actions that carry to solve the problem.
But this intervention of the NATO, decided to the *margen of the Nations Joined and with unsuitable means for the goals declared to neutralise the #serbian military capacity to continue the called «ethnic cleansing» no only has not resolved the question, but that, besides, has aggravated #all the problems.
We regret, nevertheless, that have not posed  a terrestrial presence European to #the same time that the aerial offensive and that simultaneously have not programmed  a humanitarian action of big *envergadura to receive the wave of refugees *desprovistos of resources, that launch  to the roads.
By the contrary, when proposing, in his considering *J, weaken and *marginar the notion of sovereignty national, that, in spite of #all his imperfections, constitutes, with #everything, the fundamental regulatory principle of our international community, the resolution introduces a factor #whose consequences will not be able to be but extremely *desestabilizadoras and *perturbadoras in the international life.
The broadcast of money electronic, want to underline it, is so only an element of the much wider frame of the electronic trade of the systems of payment and, in the field of these last, of the electronic payments.
From it takes years, the Parliament exerts a prominent paper in the fight against the violence by means of parliamentary reports, by means of the initiative to make a campaign against the violence in relation with the women. But especially, by means of special budgetary lines with the that we #can support on the terrain the very interesting initiatives of the numerous *ONG.
Gentleman President, believe that #all are fully of agreement on the analysis of the events that finish to take place in *Níger and the need of a return, it before possible, to the rules of right and to the operation of the democracy in this country, after the coup d'état and the murder of the President #Ibrahim *Baré *Mainassura.
The Commission is satisfied with the recent statement of the Prime minister *Hun *Sen, in the that is in favour that the judges and the foreign public prosecutors exert a central paper in *Camboya in the process of the leader prisoner of the *Jemeres #red, *Ta *Mok, to end to guarantee that the planned process adapt  to the international norms in vigour.
We go to ask to the government that occupy  that #all the #polish citizens have freely of plural information so much on the advantages as on the problems of the adhesion to the equal that expect that it fulfil his promise to celebrate a referendum on the belonging of the country to the EU.
The attempt to control by #all the means the increasing traffic #can not convert in pretext so that the citizens and the companies of transport that use the railway, the road, the aerial transport or the navigable roads are subjected each two by three to new taxes. And after all it is #this it that occurs.
The fight against the violence, without embargo, has marked  the limit of the regulation, of the juridical definition of the systems of resource, #this is, has found in the article 152 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam the juridical foundation of the program.
Or to this sector no *le remains more remedy that *resignarse to that always there will be a difference of price among the corn of the world-wide market and the corn of the EU by the simple reason that in the EU there #be a deficit of corn?
Lady Speaker, the Commission received to finals of January an exhibition of reasons of the #italian authorities in the that collected  the official position on the start of a procedure in relation with the subject *C-81/97, published in the Official Diary of the European Communities of 18 February 1998.
*Eso Was contradictory and the Parliament saw  forced to tackle this subject by means of a motion of censorship by separate of the Commission, with it that destroyed  the direct links among the denial of the approval of the management and the consequence of the exit of the Commission.
From this situation the president of the Commission of Control Budgetary asked on 15 January 1999 in this Assembly by commission of the commission that the Commission of Regulation cleared how is it that the Treaty foresees exactly or that neutralised  this accumulation of no approvals of the management and of possible votes of distrust.
*Permítaseme Say that, in spite of the unavoidable difficulties owed to the rule of the unanimity, results *innegable that now -to instances of the #german Presidency and with the support of this Parliament- are reaching  advances in the application of the strategy against the harmful fiscal competition and have fixed  varied goals for the European Council of *Helsinki.
Of #the same mood have to say that the group of the representation of the Popular Party European in the Commission of Control Budgetary has shown in #all moment his support to the speaker, has presented battle and has reached the goal proposed.
*Permítaseme Examine also another subject of bottom of the original report on the approval of the management in the exercise 1996: the program of reform, that the President in functions *Santer took #his on 11 January in his program of reform of the Commission.
Exactly by this reason have initiated an evaluation of the risks and already have of the provisional results of *ella, that, as have understood, derive  in part of a new examination of the bibliography published with arrangement to criteria established by the organ of appeal and in part of the provisional conclusions of #some of the seventeen new studies that have commissioned.
#If we had carried out an economic politics, #would have offered the references, the orientations, the guidelines, the future that #this *Europa had to follow economically and perhaps #would have been able to reduce in *algún point the unemployment and *reconquistar of this form this confidence that the citizens are beginning to lose.
In definite, has not advanced  at all in the improvement of the conditions of the rural world, there are difficulties from the point of sight of the agricultural politics and there are difficulties, of course, by the fault of a #european politics of economic and social cohesion.
The hegemony, in this case specifically the hegemony of the market, also *me concerns in my quality of economist and of defender of the economy of market. In effect, in #ours *Europa have developed a model of economy social of market, that concerns  especially by the reduction and prevention of the unemployment.
The Report *Menrad proposes  restart the subject of the politics of employment #european -and in this sense results pertinent the recent intervention of the Mr. *Berthu on the economic political situation-, anticipating to the adoption of the #european package in matter of employment that definitely will approve  in Colony.
Said #this, create, to the equal that the speaker, that for now and from a point of sight technical, is important to take note of the accounts of the budget of the corresponding European Community to the exercise 1996. It is necessary that continue the examination of the accounts of the back exercises.
#All the neighbouring countries, #all the bordering states, except the of *Milosevic, wish three things: they wish the internal democracy and wish *garantizarla by means of the external security in the frame of the NATO and to *través of the economic development in the breast of the European Union.
We will accept then a peace, based in a #russian mediation, that do not fulfil with the requirements proposed, that do not guarantee the limits and the territorial integrity of *Kosovo, that do not make possible a safe return of the refugees and expelled of *Kosovo and that give to *Milosevic the possibility to appear as victorious in front of the #serbian?
We do not have to, without embargo, hide the every time greater unrest of our public opinions by the intensive and systematic bombardment of a #european country and of his capital, by the every time greater number of civil victims that cause daily our bombardments.
Already it is hour that the European Parliament take part to reestablish the conditions of democracy valid in our western countries, because there #be still representatives and militants of the party of the opposition in the prison and #some deputies have been deprived of the parliamentary immunity.
By #this, in spite of #all the fine arguments that have listened, the alternative only #can be a political solution, but on the base of the renunciation to the use of the strength, of the respect of the human rights and of the return of the refugees.
We had to have claimed the right of *darnos a statute -#this had to have been the strategy- a statute with the and capital that comprised the incompatibilities, the prerogatives of the deputy, the #status of the deputy and no our financial diet that it is an internal subject.
By his part, the Parliament approved this question already takes more of half year, by it that is justified in part the criticism that here has exposed  in the sense that the Parliament has not had of the sufficient time to study the document of the Council.
But during the first six months invests  the weight of the proof, *eso means, that believes  that a defect existed already in the moment of the delivery, #if the seller #can not show a damage caused by the customer or #if the type of the product do not allows this possibility.
Gentleman President, share fully the words of the Mr. President and *me #would enjoy to take advantage of this occasion to appreciate to the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer and especially to the speaker, Mrs. *González *Álvarez, the work that has carried out and the interest that has shown along the processing of this proposal.
The modifications contributed to the ancient procedure are three: the suppression of the designated negative version of the third reading, thanks to the *cual, #if it had not got  to an agreement in conciliation, the Council #can follow advance and approve his own text for afterwards present it to the Parliament *confrontándolo to refuse it by absolute majority in the term of six weeks.
I want to congratulate also to the Mr. *Manzella and to the Mr. *Corbett, #as well as to the negotiators of the three institutions by the excellent work made and for having known find a point of balance among a dynamic application of the disposals and the obligation to respect fully the Treaty.
#If the Union and the Presidency gave value to these two files in the European Council to indicate the road, to adopt a decision that was the of the Union in the coming months, #would have a firm commitment in two fields that, to my trial, will be decisive of face to the *tercer #millenium.
The responsibility by this *asoladora violence, by the civil victims, by the destruction of the foundations of life and the civil infrastructures in Serbian and by the use of arms forbidden, the have #all #that that now do not reestablish the empire of the right and do not finalise this war.
I wish to express my deep disappointment by it that *sucedió yesterday, *cuando my Group presented to other Presidents of group the possibility to try find a reasonable mood to advance, and that taking into account that the Council gathers  tonight and tomorrow, took a more definite decision, but #some colleagues resorted to procedures of this Assembly to block said possibility.
But, *cuando in the day of today refuses  our amendment 18, that said that *nosotros *nos showed had to take it necessary so that this statute went in in vigour to the start of the next term of office, remove  the masks and takes  in #the same day. In #the same week adopts  a new mood of repayment of costs of trip, purportedly based in real costs, *cuando conserves a global character.
Whereas a solid juridical base #would allow the put in practice of a true politics integrated in favour of the insular regions by half, mainly, of the Structural Bottoms, the Council and the Commission have decided another thing, overlooking besides the recommendations of the European Parliament on this question.
With the firm position of the Parliament, that has allowed that the Commission retreat to a position less *intransigente thanks to the perseverance and to the tenacity of #some States members, the commitment is satisfactory in the short term regarding the abandonment of the *cofinanciación, to a descent of the agricultural prices guaranteed more moderated of it planned and to the «*statu *quo» of the quotas.
When separating  of the politics of support to the agriculture by means of the prices, when compressing  to a nationalisation, *fragilizándose by a new increase of the direct helps to the income, *Europa moves away increasingly of his mission and of the principles founders of the agricultural common market.
On this point, am in big part satisfied of the commitment of *Berlín oriented to put in his spot, #if it gets the case, the line agricultural guideline to the thread of the successive enlargements and on the consideration, in the financial perspectives, of an adjust automatic annual to take into account the inflation.
Said approval will consolidate #a lot of months of efforts that this Parliament has devoted to guarantee the best possible agreement for the development balanced of our regions and the growth of the economic and social cohesion of the European Union.
The agreements *interinstitucionales and his financial perspectives have been an element of progress in the Community and have allowed a peaceful development and ordered of the #european budgetary life #as well as the achievement of a big series of political goals.
We have defined on purpose the scope of the bottom so that it #can answer to the evolution of the economy and of the labour market during the next seven years, always with seen to encourage and to take possible that a greater number of persons have an active participation in the labour market.
Among the #others important elements of the regulation modified include , first, a really new modality for the investment of the bottoms allocated to the *RTE in bottoms of capital of risk so as to have access to some resources, that #can be very great, of finance on a long-term basis that the companies of insurances and the bottoms of pensions put to disposal to fund public projects of infrastructure.
*Yo Create, lady Commissioner, that has carried out a fine reform, positive, of the structural Bottoms, with his projects of concentration, of simplification and with a *partenariado effective by means of the contribution of the regional and local authorities, that #can reach an efficient development in the effective application of these structural Bottoms.
The Union supports besides #all the #tending initiatives to improve the operation of the program «oil by foods» and remits  in this context especially to the proposals presented on 30 March 1999 by the signpost of the Council of Security of the UN on the humanitarian situation in the *Iraq.
Neither it is acceptable that, to the contrary, by it other, of it that the European Parliament approved here in November of 1998, keep  the *condicionalidad of the Bottom of Cohesion concerning the Pact of Stability and that now, for example, the Commission of Politics Regional propose a favourable opinion to the proposal of regulation that has exactly #that *condicionalidad.
The results are not perfect, but, in spite of the budgetary insufficiencies, of the timidity of the reform of the *PAC and of the injustices and disequilibriums that keeps, has averted , anyway, a grave crisis in the European Union and #can say  that in the next years the European Union goes to advance with confidence and stability.
Without embargo, #would wish *rendir homage to the Prime minister and to the *Viceprimer Minister of the Assembly of *Irlanda of the North by the support that *me have loaned, and to the Council and to the Commission because I consider that we have reached a reasonable and positive agreement for *Irlanda of the North on a long-term basis, by it that am satisfied treats  of a commitment, but of a commitment that is good for my region.
Nevertheless, have the impression of that it exists a real need to go back to orient, situate and consider the goals that have not been able to reach in the past, all *ello to guarantee no only a suitable cost of the bottoms, but also to bequeath positive looks there #where has allocated  #european money.
But yes I wish to reiterate my request to the Commission so that now finally elaborate a directive on the social security, so that the Council #can not follow hiding behind the excuses that has used up to now, so that at last really debate  a directive on the social security to level of the Council.
Regarding the amendments on the creation of a *vademécum and on the criteria for the provision of information to the companies, especially to the #SME, agree in that a simple statement in the record of the Council is not a guarantee of follow-up sufficient.
Also I want to appreciate to those who have cooperated in this obstinacy along these years and -how no!- To #all those members of the secretariat of the Commission *REX, that also have put his obstinacy in these goals, and to #all #that that have believed that the cooperation with *América Latin was a very interesting cooperation for *nosotros.
I am not of course any follower of the politics *neoliberales, but the suppression of the commercial barriers is a reality and the entrance in vigour of the Agreement of Free Trade of the Atlantic North has increased the #mexican dependency of the trade with the States Joined.
*Me Upset the #news of *México in the sense that no  *nos has offered #all the necessary information, that it has  *marginado to the civil society, and that the interests of the multinationals and the private capital have happened to occupy a too much predominant position.
It wanted to ask here to the Presidency of the Council how the #european institutions, and especially the #european deputies freely chosen, #can explain to the citizens and the citizens of *Europa that adopted  a decision of these characteristics without the participation of the Parliament, without that the Parliament was properly informed, without that it was consulted.
The Report #Orlando, approved airily the past Tuesday, without that not even it have celebrated  a vote, is a reflection of the speech of investiture of the President *Prodi with the end to demand this #european politics with regard to the cities.
This result is especially important for the cities, since it reinforces and converts in more credible the Plan of action for a sustainable city, presented by the Commission the past month of November in *Viena, and because it reinforces the instruments contained in the Goals 1 and 2 of the structural Bottoms in favour of the cities.
From it takes varied years, the villages of the Union refuse every time with greater clarity the politics *ultraliberales and the damages that #this *ocasionan to the employment, to the income, to the diets of protection social and to the public services, to the environment and to the ordination of the territory.
Afterwards, the fact that the candidate President have to present his political orientations in front of the European Parliament -it that the Roman Mr. *Prodi has designated precisely his «program of government»-, forces it to reach a majority in the Parliament, on the that will support his action.
Gentleman President, have to say, to the equal that my colleagues, that to guarantee the process of peace, the Palestinians have accepted - showing in this way his fine will- postpone the date of the statement of the #palestinian State, that the Agreements of *Oslo had fixed for 4 May.
Gentleman President, believe that #all will recognise that the approval by the Conference of Blunt, on 18 July 1998, of the Statute of the International Penal Court Permanent represented a progress in the international institutions and in the international juridical order of the human rights.
I believe that the European Union #would have to help to the Czech Republic to endow  of another system of production energetic, using soft «energies», but #would not have to release bottoms to build a head office of the #soviet type *VVER 1000, that, in my opinion, presents #a lot of risks.
In December of 1998, *nosotros kept our amendments against the common position, and lo and behold that in January of 1999, the Council discovers that it is necessary to modify the Regulation 330/91, *cuando the modification proposed by the Commission was on of the table from 2 June 1997 and *cuando in this enclosure already had effected  two readings.
Gentleman President, the Commission congratulates  by the initiative of the Parliament to support the adoption, to community level, of a rule that allow to determine the juridical and economic effects derived of the failure of the companies that operate in the breast of the inner market.
Proposal of regulation (*CECA, *CE, *EURATOM) of the Council by the that they insert  the corresponding quantities to *Austria, *Finlandia and *Suecia in the article 13 of the Annex *VII of the Statute of the civil servants of the European Communities, relative to the diets by mission inside the #european territory of the States members of the European Union (*COM(99)0133 - *C4-0226/99-99/0076(*CNS))
agreed  fix greater compensations for the *cultivadores of industrial potatoes of the that the Commission had proposed, giving at the end prevail by the number of hectares, on condition that the number of hectares went  reducing appropriately. In this way the decision in his group #would have a neutral budget, in accordance with the original proposal of the Commission.
I believe that it has achieved  give a big step when inaugurating in front of the pavilion of the EU or of the exhibition of the EU a square devoted to #Robert *Schuman. I believe that it also has been a #ours common attainment explain how importance has had precisely #Robert *Schuman for the development of *Europa and how importance purchases this square that will remain for back uses.
The result of this confluence of elements negative is that to the textile employer European *le serves of little have proceeded -as it has proceeded- to important investments in high technology and ambitious restructurings for *modernizar his company, have specialised in the quality, in the style, in the design, in the #european mark.
In the first turn, in the *cual the election of the President of the Parliament did not have to the principle any possibility that it produced , *nosotros had decided to present the candidature of the Mrs. #Laura *González, to strengthen our specific presence in the breast of the left.
Besides, the congratulate no only for being President, and a President of sex feminine, but also for being from takes varied years a big colleague, and *le wish a good work that *redunde in benefit of the Parliament, of the internal reform, but especially of the Assembly and of *Europa, because I know his big personal adhesion to *Europa, to our common vision.
The second point is that to keep the capacity of negotiation of a *Europa expanded is indispensable that resolve  to time and of exhaustive way before the enlargement the three institutional questions that remained slopes in *Amsterdam: the size and composition of the Commission, the vote *ponderado in the Council and the enlargement of the procedure of vote by majority.
*Me Seems very important -for our Group, anyway- that in the reform of the institutions that goes  to undertake concede  a greater weight to the national democracies and to the national parliaments, in place to leave that *Europa follow sinking and moving away of the citizens, when creating a democracy that have called virtual.
We expect of the Commissioners that board the dialogue with the deputies to the European Parliament in the earliest moment possible of the process of adoption of decisions, but especially expect that they respect the principles of transparency and subsidiariness and also our democracies and his traditions.
The last facts related with the pollution of #some foods with dioxin in *Bélgica have caused a particularly grave situation, no longer only by the risks that involves for the health of the persons but also because it has weakened  the confidence in the *piensos, in the chain of production of foods and in the control of the authorities.
Apart from the urgent measures already announced, the services of the Commission are working now, and east is the most general frame, in proposals for the improvement or, #if it is the case, the hardening of the valid disposals in the Community on alimentary products for animals and persons.
In relation with the meeting summit that *clausuró the works of the Council under the #german Presidency, want to insist from a principle in the good work effected by this Presidency, in a dangerous international context and in a period of «doubt» by part of the #european opinions.
In this case, as in *tantos #others, the facts are more *elocuentes that the words, and in it that to me concerns, and in it that concerns to the President and to the Commission designated #this is a maximum and a reality that goes to *modelar the task *reformadora of the Commission from the principle, #if #that is the result of the vote of this Assembly the Wednesday.
It reinforces enormously the fine intention of the Commission but really #would produce  recommendations frankly *insustanciales for the procedures of inspection that #would not guarantee the achievement of improvements and provides a program of action detailed to ensure that the existent laws are applied inside a realistic calendar but adjusted.
The preparation for the enlargement will not be an easy task and will not see  facilitated #if the Parliament and the Commission do not collaborate closely to guarantee that they take  firm decisions on these subjects or study  in some surroundings of understanding and with a common purpose.
There #be not doubt that #if in the decade that finishes this year, had prevailed the sensitivity by the different realities of the villages in the #european position with regard to the ancient *Yugoslavia, in place of *obsesionarnos with the concept of State, the things had been very distinct and, definitely, no so disastrous.
Gentleman President, gentleman President designated of the Commission, *yo go to vote tomorrow in favour of his Commission, but before *me will take an analgesic for the headache and surely will need a double dose, seen the denouement and the results of the audiences, of the that has gone out *airosa a Commission announced like excellent, but that has not had a brilliant performance.
Without embargo, the #belgian government has designated in the person of the Mr. *Busquin a candidate to commissioner that during years has been president of #one *association give *malfaiteurs, an association of malefactors, of the Socialist Party *Valón, an association that is a true model of scandals of *sobornos, finance with traffic of arms, fraud, political nominations, *malversación of public bottoms and #european subventions.
On the great files that have in front - negotiations on the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, Conference *Intergubernamental, debates on the Mediterranean subject - the President of the Commission has communicated likewise his will to associate like able actors to adopt decisions to the deputies of this Parliament.
Gentleman *Prodi, his agreement with the gentleman *Poettering is signal of a new was, a possibility to achieve a totally new culture inside the Commission, precisely directed to recover the confidence and the interest of part of the citizens by #ours EU.
The Parliament has to consider very seriously his paper, especially after the scarce participation in the recent elections in #a lot of States members - a clear sample of the *desinterés, and more probably of the cynicism and disdain of our citizens - our mission today is to answer to the audition of the Commissioners designated and to the question posed by the President designated, Mr. *Prodi.
We ask that the School of Commissioners and *usted same, in his quality of President of #the same, develop the ambition to promote the integration of the goals of equality among the men and the women in the general politics, an ambition that translate  in progresses and improvements *mensurables.
The new Commission only will go in in functions a time that have approved tomorrow his election in our quality of Parliament and after the Commissioners and Commissioners have sworn his charges in front of the Court of Justice European the Thursday to the 12.00 hours, in *Luxemburgo.
We do not mix this debate with the debate of morning on the budgets *rectificativos and supplementary 1, 3 and 4 for 1999, because *cuando the President in exercise affirms that this spirit of cooperation is based in the mutual confidence (*eso is it that have written) among the institutions, do not have more that remember to the Council it that took with the budgets *rectificativos and supplementary 1 and 3 and #which was #ours reaction.
The principles of clarity, transparency and of *rectitud ethical have to chair the taking of decisions in the breast of the Union, so much in the looks of culture administrative intern as in the referents to guarantee the security and the rights of the citizens.
The proposal do not includes any reference to these central solutions and has like only object promote the federalistic development of the European Union, a development that the majority of the population of my country, *Dinamarca, refused in the referendum on the Treaty of *Amsterdam celebrated in 1993.
#If really they wish to create a democratic space of security, freedom and justice have to guarantee that the European Parliament convert  in legislator with equality of rights in #all those fields in that they already have taken the decision -although of form certainly *titubeante- of *conferirle this competition in a future no very far. Of it contrary, run the danger that the European Union  *distancie even more of his citizens.
There #be a point of the proposal of resolution by the that seat big charm and is the point *séptimo *b in the that it censors  the fact that the texts of the decision in matter of the cooperation *Schengen still have not been given to know, although #this have happened to form part of the community right from May of this year.
But it more important of the proposal of Colony is the method. In place to leave these questions in hands of the national Governments pretends  create a species of assembly in the that have representation the national Parliaments, the European Parliament and the Governments.
More that of the Letter of the fundamental rights treats  of the implantation of a new procedure of collaboration among the national Parliaments, the national Governments and the European Parliament that it #can award to the European Union the big *legitimación that *le allow to put final point to his task.
Finally, #ours *Europa has to *proscribir #all form of discrimination in the employment, the house and the access to the leisure and remember to #all those that deny the existence of the houses of gas and that believe that the races are uneven that the racism is not an opinion, but an offence.
The means that #would have to use, in my opinion, lady Speaker, are three: the police cooperation -having very in account the progresses that have achieved  through *Schengen-, the prevention of the crime and the external relations, since the security in the Union #can not  isolate of the of the rest of *Europa neither of the world.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen deputies of the European Parliament, the European Union has supported, already from the principle of the conflict, the attempts of *Portugal and Indonesian to get to a solution for *Timor Oriental that was accepted by the international community, endorsed by the UN and that was based in the self-determination of his citizens.
The organisation armed ETA has established a #alto the fire and the majority of the political parties, unions and #basque civil organisations have signed an agreement in *Lizarra-*Estella (*Navarra) that pretends *reconducir the #basque conflict by the roads of the dialogue and the negotiation.
In *ella appears a point *b) that tackles, in my opinion, a point of subjection essential of the #european institutional architecture: the right of initiative of the Commission, that has to act *colegialmente and be the only that have the right to propose #european legislation.
In my opinion, of it that treats  especially is to recover a credible speaker, put end to a situation of transition interminable and allow to the #european executive restart his difficult task and advance at last, in narrow *concertación with the #european deputies, in relation with the questions determinants that affect to *Europa and to his citizens.
*Eso Do not removes so that the statements that Roman *Prodi has taken from his presentation in front of the European Parliament have to disappoint by strength and upset to those who expect of the European Union fast answers, audacious, to reorient *Europa to the service of the villages and of the men and no of the finances and of the powerful cavalier Gift Money so that *Europa affirm  like an option in front of the *mundialización liberal.
We have to warn to #all the managers. #If of here to little it do not produces  a change in the politics of Indonesian, *nos will see forced -and now *me direct to the Council and to the Commission- to loom to this country with #all the economic means that have to our scope to end to achieve the cooperation of the #indonesian managers.
It considers the Presidency of the Council in exercise, like the *PE, that already give  the conditions so that the majority of the members of the General Assembly of the Nations Joined pronounce  this year in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of the capital penalties?
Now well, there are #a lot of borrowers, particularly in *Irlanda, that have hired mortgages of fixed interest, sometimes to a type of interest that is three more elevated times that the current type, and the institutions borrowers do not want to adjust the types of interest without imposing considerable financial sanctions.
The juvenile delinquency *nos seems a problem of big *embergadura and is taking it in account, as we will be able to influence in the evolution of the delinquency in the future, since the illicit guidelines of behaviour purchased in the youth are harmful on a long-term basis, so much for #the same criminals, through the consequences of the offences, as also for the society in his group.
Regarding his headquarters share the wise point of meeting proposed by the Mr. *Swoboda and, finally, *me has enjoyed the image of the ray of sun employed by the Mr. Go *der *Waal, although *yo #would be more realistic: it opens  a ray of hope important, yes, but remains without resolving the political knot.
As a result of the appeal of the European Council of Colony to create an agency, the proposal of the Commission bases  mainly in the model of #all the other current #european agencies: a structure with own juridical personality and with powers to take decisions and in #whose council of administration are represented the States members.
Among the maximalist positions, that demand the recognition of the right to the return, *obviando the real problems that #would generate the massive return of refugees and the irreducible positions, that do not assume the existence of the problem, there are intermediate options that suits to explore, boost and set up.
Other innovations in this agreement are the Article 4 on payments, the Article 8 on visibility of the community contribution, the Article 9 on arbitration and the Article 12 on the entrance in vigour, #all *ellos directed to increase the transparency and the surrender of accounts for his approval.
First, the goal of the proposal of decision of the Council is not the to regulate an appeal of information *interinstitucional, but the to approve the text of the Agreement *CE-*OOPS and authorise to the Commission the subscription of #the same in name of the Community.
Regarding the amendments approved in the Commission of Environment, *nosotros have voted against the group of amendments that ask to the next coastal countries to the European Union that use the programs *PHARE, *TACIS and *MEDA, to contribute financially to create a community frame of cooperation.
For example, in the section 10 says  that the European Parliament, quote: "it considers urgent that, to facilitate the integration of the citizens of countries third residents legally in the territory of the European Union, #this tackle the relative principles to the statute of these persons" .
In relation with the point 19, that treats to give to *Europol operative faculties, think that it has to interpret like that it is a development of the collaboration of *Europol #whose goal is to boost the fight against the international delinquency, but #this has to make in the frame of the right of the States members to have full control on the police activity inside his territory.
In addition to the grave structural problems like the fault of investment, the public debt, in particular the external debt, has experienced a fast growth and in these moments is not clear how propose  the authorities pay the interests of this heavy debt.
The conflict in *Daguestán no only turns around the crash among the #russian army and the #islamic militants *chechenos. Also it turns around questions like the weakness of *Rusia, the oil of the Sea *Caspio, and the poverty in the *Cáucaso northern, aggravated by the fault of support economic of *Moscú.
The European Union has to follow acting under the #finnish Presidency so that they reestablish  what before the relations with *Birmania, but on the base of the respect to the human rights, to the result of the elections and with release of the #british prisoners arrested for defending the democracy.
We appeal in any case to the President of the State and to his Government so that it put  of agreement together with #all the political strengths of the country on an electoral procedure that concede #the same opportunities to any political group that respect the democratic rules of the game.
Before they precipitate  *ustedes to leave , the General Secretary has agreed that, as they still appear #many of *ustedes in the list of orators, will consider #all the letters that *nos get like an explanation of vote that will publish  in the Record of today, always that they send the letters before the end of the next week so that they #can take his proposals.
*Me #Would enjoy to begin congratulating to my colleague #James *Provan by the excellent presidency of the debate that has been the first to the that have assisted being *él the president and that has resulted a very interesting and useful exercise in the goal to improve the conditions of our environment of work.
The Commissioner *Byrne is -have to add- #worthy of *encomio by his prompt acceptance of the preparation of a White Book on the legislation of the EU in matter of back date of this year and also give a more strict character to the system of #alert fast for the emergencies in matter of foods.
And *cuando talk of the wide and modern concept of the human rights, also the recently born boy and infected with the *HIV in *Zimbabwe is our mate regarding the human rights and no the circles that consciously close the eyes and do not share with the population it that know on the forms of treatment and especially of prevention.
*Permítanme That *les remember also that the implantation of the alternative energies includes two significant subjects: the hydroelectric energy and the aeolian energy, that proportionally already represent a so important part that takes  necessary boost very acutely #all the remaining, as for example the solar energy, but also the *aprovechamiento of the biomass.
The insistence in the diffusion of information in *ALTERNER *II is very important in truth and am desirous to see, #if it still is available, the spot of the Centre *Agores in the Mesh *Multimedios World-wide, that is allocated clearly to gather #all class of information on the renewable energy so that #everyone #can *consultarla and keep to the day.
An essential part of the Agreement is, besides, the commitment of the parts to defend the democratic principles, the human rights, the State of Right and the responsible administration of the State.
No *me allow to judge the subjects posed by his *Señorías, but wanted to say that maybe this moment of dialogue with the Commission #would have to circumscribe to the debate and to the decisions taken by the Commission, because, of it contrary, runs  the risk to finish in another instrument, the that goes to begin inside some instants, is to say, the turn of questions.
Personally, I am favourable to the idea, that *yo consider important in front of the citizens and to the problems that arise, of a #european strength of civil security to act better together, with more rapidity and of a more visible form in case of natural catastrophe, so much in the territory of the Union as in the outside and God knows that catastrophes do not are missing, as it shows the actuality.
To tenor of an agreement with the humanitarian agents more representative, the help will go especially directed to consolidate the humanitarian structures already existent in the zone and to help to the local population to help to the displaced with medical help, alimentary help and hostel.
Subject: conjoint Service for the community help to the countries no members (*SCR) there #be not time to give to the Commission with the litany of problems to that they have to face up the *ONG of the north and of the south by it that refers  to the reception of credits for projects already agreed by the ancient *DG *VII.
These attempts have a fine base in the correspondence kept among the #turkish Prime minister, *Ecevit, and the previous Presidency of the European Union: the Prime minister confirmed in a letter that *Turquía splits of the criteria of *Copenhague to carry out his integration in the Union.
To advance in this terrain need the support of the European Parliament in the granting of helps financial concrete and a general backrest to the approach and development of the relations among *Turquía and the European Union.
With regard to the amendment 1, the Commission always has been of the opinion that the politics on the renewable energy and the politics on the energetic efficiency are closely related among himself/hisself and have to be coordinated in common, but *nos ask #if it is not premature a letter on the renewable energy.
This resolution goes to encourage to the #turkish diet to intensify the politics of repression against the villages *kurdo and Turkish; to continue with the occupation of *Chipre, to follow with #the same *intransigencia and contempt to the decisions of the UN and, finally, goes to exert a negative paper.
And second, in our own house, the Commission has to put his things in order because in this moment the services of the Commission commissioned to attend the claims in front of the organism of solution of conflicts of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade are absolutely deficient.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, believe that to these heights #all in this Parliament coincide in the need to tackle the problem of the climatic change of rigorous form, no only for fulfilling a commitment assumed by the European Union but also by the indisputable global importance of the problem.
Has knowledge the President in exercise of the Council that the suspension of the free sales of taxes, against of the majority opinion of the States members, has weakened the strategy of airports, aerial lines and companies of maritime transport of *pasajeros to keep the rates it more possible drops?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the tragedy of *Ustica, with more of 80 dead persons, almost twenty years of investigations, in addition to the 15 victims that it is necessary to relate with this tragedy during and after the investigations, has to *obligarnos to *reflexionar on three crucial points: the transparency, the responsibility and the arrogance of some type of power military and no only military.
Of #the same mood that the tragedy of the mount *Cermis did not go only a #italian problem and tackled  to scale international, also *Ustica deserves this forum, deserves an explanation and deserves our respect in front of it that is taking the magistrature that will have to get until the bottom to end to determine the responsibilities and *atribuirlas to the one who correspond.
It has to have a complete cooperation among #all the States members of the European Union #if we want to be in conditions to exert the part that *nos corresponds in the reduction of the level of the broadcasts of gases of effect *invernadero, that so destructive paper are exerting at present in our own world-wide environment.
Now well, *nos have *percatado that the reason that the Commission wished to formulate the statement the Friday was that the Thursday there was a meeting of the veterinary scientific Committee that goes to occupy  of this question, and therefore the Commission wanted to be in conditions to give more informations the Friday.
An Office of Fight against the Fraud, created, as it is logical, to watch by the fine execution of the community budget, has *algo that see with the establishment of a control in #all the directions applied without discrimination #any no only to the agents, but also -like somebody already has signalled- to the members of the institutions?
It was a very important decision in *pro of the creation of this office, as the fight against the fraud exerts a central paper in the assessment of the #european politics by part of the citizens and of the citizens of the States members.
Finally, the directive constitutes also a good example of a consistent performance of the European Union in the field of Subjects Inner, in the inner market, but, to #the same time, constitutes an opening to the international cooperation.
We need the advantages for the security that indicate  in the Directive of the Mr. *Ferri, but also need to focus with #a lot of greater amplitude the form of *ocuparnos of the world-wide technical norms in an industry of importance capital for the European Union.
The European Union has assumed the commitment to fund the reconstruction of *Kosovo. At present, in *Kosovo no only is necessary to reconstruct the bridges, the schools, the technical infrastructure, but also reestablish, of general way, a democratic civil society and peaceful in the region.
Without embargo, #this did not means that it #can opt  for following the road of the discounts and think that they will be able to release  quietly resources to fund the politics in other fields by means of linear cuts in the agricultural sector, that did not includes only the costs allocated to the agriculturalists, but also for the group of the rural space.
Also it #can create *algo of space, and maybe was an idea for the negotiations with the Council, to take out of the bottom for the humanitarian helps the 89 millions allocated to the humanitarian actions in *Kosovo and *incluirlos in the integral package for the finance of the region.
This year, that is a key year with the war of *Kosovo, the events of *Timor, the earthquakes of *Turquía, the commitments of a Union that pretends  more responsible in the international scene, the Council *nos proposes a budget of 92 *millardos, is to say, 4 *millardos less that the budget of the previous year.
On the other hand, also it is necessary to elaborate -in this look do not agree with #some of the orators that *me have preceded- a statute of the political parties Europeans. In effect, *yo believe that it also is necessary a greater transparency and a greater efficiency in the field of the finance of the to scale #european parties.
In fact, we do not have to forget that the true competitor are *ellos and that, therefore, only the budgetary politics directed to protect the investments and the economic growth, *nos will allow to seat the bases of a Union surely stronger from the point of sight structural and economic.
Without embargo, and assuming that the fishing is a community politics #whose finance gives off of the Treaties, has found  among #all a formula that allows not refusing in first reading the amendments of the Council, included the referred to the fishing, but differ his approval until the moment in that it achieve  a financial agreement with the Council.
*Yo Want to remember that the Parliament has supported to said federation of associations that groups to the organisations of women #european and *le has entrusted the transposition of the platform of action of *Pequín in the field of the no governmental organisations, and *me seems that it #would be disastrous that any organisation of women #can benefit now of said budget.
Our politics of communication awards a clear priority to keep and improve the credibility of the *SEBC and the confidence in the euro, being both things -the credibility and the confidence- crucial elements for the fine course of the monetary politics.
The commission also refused the point of sight of the Greens, expressed in his amendment of today, that it #would be necessary to modify the relative mandate to the stability of the prices to take into account the difficulties to the that #would confront  only the manufacturers #if they dropped his prices.
In effect, on the one hand, #all *nosotros have appreciated the increasing paper that said Institution - and to #the same time, of reflection, #all the Union - has come exerting in the last times in terms of economic politics and, especially, labour; by #another, #this has not sufficed so that the euro did not suffer the effects of the speculations and weakened  in front of our competitors - that do not have to exclude at all - that they are the States Joined and the *NAFTA.
It has been the first meeting of this type since the European Parliament ratified the new School of European Commissioners, and the new President, Roman *Prodi, has declared many times his sincere commitment to explain much more with the Parliament in the taking of decisions in the future.
In *tercer place, this summit has been important because although until then we had reached to take reality the Economic and Monetary Union, without embargo, this special summit has given a *primer step to a Union of the Security, to a space of freedom, security and of the right for the citizens of *Europa.
Before yielding the use of the word to my colleague #Michel *Barnier, that goes to present to His *Señorías the goals of the Conference *Intergubernamental, wish to appreciate again to the Parliament the support that has loaned to the Commission in this project, project of *Tampere, spirit of *Tampere, letter of *Tampere, but especially project of the citizens of our common Union.
It is not *superfluo work in *pro of a reorganisation of the Treaty to go back it more readable and more accessible to the citizens and to imagine a day a more comfortable modification of the common politics, by opposition to the fundamental principles of the Union.
It deletes  the right to veto, diminishes  the influence of the small nations, the President of the Commission transforms  in a species of Prime minister in a European Commission increasingly powerful, and the EU #would be a military Union.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0028/1999) of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market concerning the common position (14248/3/1998 - *C5-*COD 1994/0011) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the facilities of transport of persons by wire (Speaker: Mr. *Miller)
A madness, the committed by the #american Senate, that, as it said the Commissioner, Mr. *Patten, probably not even has committed  by strategic calculations, but by internal fights, it that worsens the question and, especially, as it has  *recalcado, incites to other countries that already are nuclear powers, to not ratifying the Treaty, and incites to other countries to purchase nuclear arms.
Gentleman President, do not need to go back to go in in the subjects that so *sucintamente has *resumido the Mr. *Patten in particular - except that *me #would enjoy to go back to take upsetting in the danger that this action of the Senate send the mistaken message to the falcons of the *Duma #russian that up to now have not answered to the initiatives directed to the nuclear disarmament.
Gentleman President, am very satisfied that the speech of this Parliament was so unanimous, and is well that the Commission, the Parliament and the Council have *recalcado the importance of the support of the European Union to the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs.
In relation with *Rusia, always are in the agenda #the same subjects, #any one that was the institution involved, so much #if it treats  of questions of the fight against the criminality, of economic reforms, of a reasonable legislation in *Rusia, for example, on the bunch of the Banking or the taxes and in any point #can detect  that they produce  some effective progresses.
#Can accept  the amendment 11, relative to the paper of information of the points of contact, on condition that his regional actions, that #can complement his national paper, base  in the disposals in vigour in the different States members and do not comport increase #any of the financial contribution of the Community.
I have taken fine note -with joy, have to say it- of the enthusiasm that has expressed  in this enclosure, of the enthusiasm with the that young deputies and less youngsters have engaged  so that the youngsters of our continent #can in the future -more still that in the past, because #everyone agreed also in underlining that the program "Youth" has contributed already a lot to millions of youngsters- build on it that already has taken  well.
#This #would have to facilitate the payment of the community contribution to the budget of the European Observatory of *Estrasburgo for 1999, is to say, for the year in course, #whose delay hampered and hampers the operation of the institution, and *yo create - although #all the commission thinks it same - that his operation is important and fundamental for the European Commission and the 34 States members that form part and that continue incorporating actively to the Observatory.
Without embargo, has been missing a juridical foundation *vinculante and #this is it that wants to create  now on the base of the section 3 of the article 130 to of the Treaty of the *CE, taking into account that the centre of information has to contribute fundamentally to strengthen the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry improving the flow of informations.
We finish to decide -have to remember it- that the common rule contained in the Agreement *interinstitucional and accompanied by the necessary measures allocated to facilitate the development flowed of the investigations of the service, of compliance with the decision of the Parliament that attaches  to the Regulation like Annex, will apply  inside the Parliament.
. (THE) The *altanería of the *superpotencia #american, put already clearly to the discovered in the criminal bombardments against *Yugoslavia, adopts dimensions of own provocation of a conception of empire only in front of #all the villages of the earth, with the continuous decisions of the Senate on the investigation and the development of arms nuclear.
After the recent decision of the Senate to return to the actuality the known "war of the stars" , voting in favour of *financiarla, in clear transgression of the Agreement *ABM, the refusal to ratify the Treaty of No Nuclear Proliferation supposes a *provocativo contempt to the world-wide demand of general and definite cessation of the nuclear proofs.
Main goal of this community legislation is the extension of the regulation mentioned, that regulate the international rail transport of dangerous commodities (*RID), to the field of the national transport, is to say, the transport that takes place in the national territory of each #one of the States members.
It is therefore by it that this report, seen like an isolated initiative, #can cause the impression to encircle  to a very concrete question, but when situating it in the #european frame, remains clear that goes much more there of the specific subject of the transport of commodities dangerous by railway.
On the other hand, these subsidies never go to get to a part of the population affected by east tie up: to the Mrs. #Manuela, that has a fishmonger; to the Mr. #Antonio, that has a shop of appliances; not even, to the carpentry of bank, that practises  in a school-workshop of *Galicia, in *Rianxo, because they do not go to have ships that repair.
Gentleman President, take part in this debate to show my position and to show also our wish of support to #all the postures that contribute, so much in the Parliament as in the European Commission, to the attainment of a new agreement of the European Union with the Realm of *Marruecos.
This granting is, in our opinion, a good incentive for #all the women and #all the men that in the world, in our regions, struggle by the application of the peace, by the defence of the human rights, by the freedom and the democracy.
The *segunda reason is that, in the past and also very recently, this subject has loaned  to operations of image that #can have been amused in *algún case, like the image to take smuggling of meat among two countries of the Community, but do not think that it was necessary to go back to resurrect some wars among our countries because *eso #can seem a parody concerning a subject that is very serious.
They refer  to five subjects: *rastreabilidad, supplementary proofs, relative questions to the derivative products, supplementary information on the controls, the inspection and the controls of the Alimentary and Veterinary Office in the facilities of *Truro, in *Devon, in the that sacrifices  and exports  this product and, by *ultimo, on the question of the labeling.
Of course, still they have not adopted  official decisions and, as I have said to His *Señorías takes a moment, the constitutional structure of said agency is still for deciding and also his reciprocal effects with the other institutions of the European Union and with the national agencies of alimentary security of the States members.
In effect, #if the Central Bank says the clear things, takes , by like this say it, the *haraquiri; #if, when talking with #this other actors, do not says the clear things - neither will have to take it because the Central Bank has to take other things - then talks for talking and loses the time.
Also it treats  that it establish  sure enough a dialogue with the Parliament, since our participation is necessary in the practice so that the dialogue define also some very concrete guidelines in favour of the citizens and the citizens, that #can *confluir afterwards in the Forum on the employment, under the #portuguese Presidency.
I have to say to the President of the Council *ECOFIN and to the Commissioner *Solbes Watches that it that initiate  in the dialogue *macroeconómico in the next days will not refer  so only to it that is occurring at present, but that will serve to create the ideal atmosphere so that, in case that there #be a problem or difficult questions, #can *sentarnos, in reality, with the social speakers and contrive solutions for our problems.
#All *nosotros, a new Parliament and a new Commission, have to materialise a decision that was taken in the Council of Colony, before being here *nosotros, and believe that it is our political will develop, change, give a distinct form to this dialogue a time that have tested it, *cuando have the first experiences and *cuando see in how direction will have to make the changes.
These persons have more difficulties that his colleagues of other economic sectors to the hour to defend  in front of the discriminations, especially, because they do not work with his colleagues of form permanent and neither in a place that was fixed and easily accessible for the #sindical representatives.
I have to underline that there #be a big distance among the proposal of the Council and the of the European Parliament; and the Commission comes with a conciliatory proposal, of a transitory period of 7 years for the application of a maximum level of 48 hours.
The EU goes to provide technical help to develop the energetic resources, to boost the effective use and the saving of the energy, and to cater clean and renewable energy, in addition to the use of technicians that are respectful of the environment.
Finally, I believe that it is of big importance the establishment of these regular contacts among the European Parliament and the Argentinian, and no only in this matter but also in the economic terrain, social and cultural, since it is an obligation of the European Union consolidate our presence in this country with the that the Europeans have *tantas things in common.
In our quality of organ legislative European, will not be able to avert have to establish in the future some maximum values and some clear terms with seen to achieve a perceivable reduction of the broadcasts of gases harmful.
I expect that the strategy on the inner market *nos give the opportunity to expand this cooperation to the preliminary stage, in the that fix  the priorities of action; and to the stage of execution, in the that it is necessary to occupy that the rules work of optimum form.
Have the greater opportunity never known to take that the Only Market was a reality for #a lot of exclusive agents and #SME in our States members that before #can have not thought in selling out of his immediate place.
Each fixed country his own priorities in matter of politics of employment and to this *respecto, like members of the *ELDR, go to *permitirnos celebrate the fact that during these last years was promoting  in the majority of countries members a politics of employment liberal that takes upsetting in guaranteeing the suitable incentives in matter of fiscal and social politics.
In the amendment 1 say that "we urge especially to the creation of a strategy of convergence social similar to the process of *Luxemburgo for the employment, with #whose help #can ensure  the priority of the model of cohesion social in the economic politics and of employment" .
It calls the attention and invites to the reflection the fact that the countries situated out of the zone euro have a tax of activity higher and #if we abandon the European Union, find even a tax of activity even more high, *me refer to our Norwegian neighbour.
Therefore, the Commission #can accept, in principle, the need to study the possible expansion of the scope of this concept, to include other characteristics of the vehicles, as they #can be the noise and the consumption of fuel and other technologies of propulsion.
Gentleman President, as they signalled previous orators, the best way to celebrate this convention is that it have converted  in a powerful and important tool for the European Union, so much for his inner politics as for the external.
Big part of #everything *eso has to  to the cruelty or the negligence of the adults and it minimum that they #can take the adults is to watch by that, *cuando a boy *carece for real of family,  *le apply the disposals of the Agreement of The there #be to the hour to offer to this boy an opportunity in the life by means of the adoption.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0052/1999) of the Mrs. *Haug, in name of the Commission of Budgets, on the proposal of decision of the Council (*COM(1999)333 - *C5-0092/1999 - 1999/0139(*CNS)) relative to the system of resources own of the European Union.
And we do not forget how much time has happened since it began his application and how many positive changes there #be had during this time. It #can mention as main the creation of the *UEM from 1 January 1999, the aspired enlargement, with the countries of *Europa central and oriental, *Chipre and Malt and, finally, the Diary 2000, that prescribes, among other things, the modifications that have to take in the agricultural sector.
I believe that in rare occasions has occurred that a speaker had to occupy during a budgetary exercise of more of 60 transfers of credits and five supplementary budgets, a big number of modifications and *complementos to the budget *originario, it that in the last debate on the budget *rectificativo and supplementary *IV *le has moved to say that it no longer recognised to his own boy, is to say, the budget 1999.
And *le take the word so that in the year 2000, in a conjoint work, much more intense and more open, from the principle #can avert that priorities like the regions *bálticas or the actions in favour of the boys are not the first affected, because #one has the suspicion that perhaps they are not *ustedes those who do not want to execute *eso, but other instances that are behind.
The report *nos remembers that to reach an important improvement of the measures of protection of the world-wide environment and the reduction of the broadcasts, need the dialogue and the consensus with our commercial competitors and with the countries in development.
Another challenge, of capital importance, refers  to the contradiction -that *me seems especially strong- among the liberalisation of the energetic networks, favourable certainly, to a drop of the prices, but also, to #the same time, to the waste, and to the promotion of a rational and economic utilisation of the energy.
The directive on great facilities of combustion to reduce the dioxide of sulphide and the oxides of nitrogen and the program Car *Oil to face up to the problem of the quality of the air in the cities are some very stood out examples.
And to conclude, gentleman President, varied orators have taken reference to a wider debate in the that they contemplated  #all the relative looks no only to the looks of demand and environmental but also to the look of our energetic sources and of our energetic dependency according to the forecasts of future.
Gentleman President, have had knowledge that the services of the Parliament -do not know #if by instruction of the Speaker- have forbidden a conference of press of the President of the Court of Accounts of the European Union in the venues of the Parliament.
In this frame, our Parliament already had the occasion to approve the proposals of modification of varied directives allocated to improve from the point of sight technological the engines and the quality of the fuels.
In effect, while it keeps  very wanders in relation with the greater part of the relative environmental questions to the sector of the energy, this resolution asks that, in the countries of the European Union, the production of electricity of nuclear origin conserve, in the future, at least the part that has at present.
Today we have voted in this Assembly on the report of the colleague *Chichester and have said in this context of a very clear mood that refuse any *imposición or any type of recommendation indirect to change to the nuclear security.
For the States of the that it treats  is an important argument because they know that the European Parliament has to give his assent at the end of the negotiations of adhesion, is to say, that without the European Parliament #can not be and is by #this by it that the wishes of the European Parliament are of the greater importance in this question.
In relation with the deficiencies in the registers of the livestock and other, the application of the plan of export according to a calendar established, #such as *yo understand it, protects the public health and guarantees the alimentary security in relation with the export of meat of bovine of the Realm Joined.
Gentleman President, the Commission presented recently to the Council, to the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee a communication subordinated to the subject "The victims of the delinquency in the European Union - reflection on the norms and the measures that have to adopt ".
To reach the economic and social stability, increase the social welfare of the citizens of the countries candidates and avert the risk of *dumping social in the current States members, the enlargement will demand that the countries candidates *modernicen his systems of security social.
The adoption of the Letter of the Security in *Europa, #if it signs  in the next days, will be definitely an element that will enhance the authority of the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in *Europa, and will be definitely a valuable complement of the development of the politics of security of the Union.
*Cuando *usted Was General Secretary of the Western European Union and #this integrate  in the European Union, #this will pose, of course, a new task of parliamentary control and the European Parliament will have to assume this function together with the national Parliaments, that will conserve likewise his function of control in this field.
We achieve, definitely, have a common coin, have advanced in the field of the economy and has got the moment to advance in the field of the politics, and very specifically in the field of the external politics and of the politics of security.
The #french delegation of our Group  *opone to this modification of the juridical nature of the act, in the sense that the regulation allows to take better in consideration the impact of the budgetary discipline in the States members as in the community institutions.
Without embargo, also think that, #all time that the Russians *nos have asked that we act like observers in the elections to the *Duma, have to consider very seriously the suitability to answer to this request of the Parliament, since *ello #would constitute a new contribution to the dialogue and to the development of the democracy, and perhaps also of a political more suitable, in *Rusia.
It Important is that *le take to know to *Rusia that this message is explicit, that it is necessary to finish with the use of the violence against the civil population, that it is necessary to begin the negotiations with the representatives chosen legally in *Chechenia, that the humanitarian help is necessary and has to get to his destination and that the *OSCE #would have to have a paper determinant in the solution of this conflict.
But the peasants, that will have been deleted, the liberal professions *marginadas, the textile industry, the chemist, the footwear, the heavy vehicles, the pieces of furniture, the fuselages, the toys, #everything *eso that will have delivered  to the competition *extraeuropea, how will take with *ello?
Thus I expect can cover, comprise and recognise the aspirations of the world developed and of the world in roads of development, and recognise the enormous advantages of the free world-wide trade, to the time that recognise also the need *imperiosa to reach the transition that allow and confer powers to the world in development to convert  in a speaker in equality of conditions of the globalisation.
The *mundialización leaves to feel his effects in the social field in #all the countries, but is necessary to ascertain that, in a series of countries less advanced, the norms of work international admitted in the frame of the International Organisation of the Work do not respect  sufficiently.
From the point of sight of our interests *multilaterales #as well as of our own interests all depend of the content of the agreement that has signed ; the #american Congress has wanted to have the novelty of the content of the quoted agreement, procedure by the *cual this Assembly #would have to have more charm that antipathy, although *me complicate the life.
We ask that it apply  the community method, by analogy with the article 48, expect that the present Commission a concrete proposal that serve of base for the negotiations and also expect can reach a consensus with the Council and with the Commission on the agenda and on the procedure of the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
To our opinion, the double legitimacy of the Union, like Union of the States, on the one hand, but by the #another side also like Union of the villages, has to remain reflected in the recognition of the power of *codecisión of the Parliament in the relative looks to the content of the futures Treated in the future negotiations with seen to the review.
The political tensions that have characterised the start of this term of office are not preventing the necessary convergences among the distinct, important, the most important, parliamentary Groups in the terrain of the strengthening of the Union, of his Institutions and of his politics.
Gentleman President, *le appreciate that *me concede the use of the word some instants in this moment of the debate, in the that have been able to listen with attention to the speakers to the that it already had heard, but also to the representatives and to the orators of the different Groups that occupy the seats of this Parliament, is to say, to #many of His *Señorías.
*Dimitrakopoulos And *Leinen the fact to having seated the bases of a new *foedus, of a luck of pact after the #european unit that organises  around the differences, tries the mediations and, especially, treats to find some principles and some fundamental units.
The Commission presented afterwards to the Council, to the European Parliament, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions his communication containing the plan of action to combat the drugs during the period 2000 - 2004.
My opinion is that in this meeting argued  the subject of the drug of way correct, more coherent, to design the future strategy, especially in it that *atañe to the trade with drug and affine terrains as, for example, the fight against the wash of money.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, as I have said, the intention of the Commission is to take out to *relucir this subject in the bilateral conversations related with the taking of a preferential agreement on the liberalisation of the services and of the acquisitions of the public sector among the EU and *Turquía.
Report (To5-0066/1999) of the Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the European Office of Fight against the Fraud (*OLAF)
*Señorías, it that go to say *reviste some importance, since they have contributed  modifications to the text that did not obtain the necessary qualified majority in this Plenary in the partial period of sessions of the month of October, to instance of the greater political Group that then expressed reservations and posed requirements of greater explanations.
The commission likewise has accepted an amendment of the Gentlemen *Nassauer and *Brok, by means of the *cual -read literally the amendment that converts  in the new article 4 of the project of decision- "have to follow without changes the relative norms to the parliamentary immunity and to the right of the deputy to no *testificar" .
My Group has examined very painstakingly the report and have got to the conclusion that it treats  of the technical materialisation of the agreement that signed the Parliament in relation with the parliamentary immunity, and that they will not cancel  the privileges without having  followed the procedure prescribed.
Report (To5-0066/1999) of the Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the European Office of Fight against the Fraud (*OLAF)
#can not  refuse in advance the requirements of other countries members of the *OMC so that we reform our agricultural politics in the Round of the #Millenium, taking that this agreement really get to be an instrument of development that contribute to diminish the differences among poor and rich countries.
Now well, nobody doubts that during the negotiations, this text of commitment, given to light with pain, will be object of multiple pressures by North American part, *cuando the Union did not presents more that an apparent homogeneity and did not has of a comparable juridical arsenal to the of the States Joined, able, #if it was necessary, to deter to the North American part.
The second principle #would have to be the "confinement" of the *OMC to represent a strictly delimited paper, and keep out of his field of competitions sectors that only #can depend of the sovereignty of the States and of the institutions chosen by the citizens, since said sectors *atañen to the own identity of each society.
Thus, although the text of the resolution subjected this morning to vote was acceptable with regard to the general goals that *nos had fixed, graces especially to the numerous amendments presented by the members of my Group, have not voted in favour of said text, to respect the commitments that have assumed in front of the constituents of the #french Departments of *ultramar (*D.Or.*M.).
Like this, it is fundamental that the European Union, the States members and #all the international community keep a strong pressure on the #indonesian authorities so that, with the greater urgency, disarm and control to the designated "militias" and believe the conditions of security necessary for the return of the refugees to *Timor Oriental, #whose territorial integrity has to be respected entirely.
It wanted to stand out also the proposal that has taken  of sending of a new delegation of the European Parliament to *Timor Oriental, precisely to verify *in crazy how is passing and occurring this process of reconstruction and have of #all the necessary elements that allow to follow keeping the of *Timor Oriental like a subject that deserves the unanimous attention of #all the #european deputies.
They have to cooperate without reservations with the Sent Special of the European Union, with the European Union, with the Nations Joined, with the Organisation of the African Unit and with #all the agencies of help humanitarian to take all it that it was necessary to end to carry peace and stability to *Ruanda and to the region of the Great Lakes of *África in general.
Only it wanted *decirles that in principle was adherent of this resolution, as it is logical, but to my mood to see has initiated  a very dangerous game that consists in using systematically the resolutions to open an ideological debate on the letter of rights fundamental.
Nevertheless, wail deeply that our amendment, in the that express our wish to suspend temporarily in the frame of this war the agreement of association and cooperation in virtue of the clause on the human rights that carries included, have not deserved the support of this Assembly.
It is a vice that weakens the will, that complicates to the individual in a dependency that enslaves it and depersonalises it, that finishes with the bows and the social relations, that engenders delinquency, increases the insecurity and feeds the criminal networks of world-wide field, that challenge to the law and to the power of the States.
The action in the field of the education, of the family, the economic cooperation with associations and *ONG, and very especially in the field of the leisure and of the sport, complement some performances that owe *desterrar of the life of our youngsters this valve of leakage that sometimes *les supposes to attend to forms of evasion that finish *destruyéndolos.
In spite of direct and indirect support of the European Union to the bank, the *BEI enjoys to present  publicly like a totally normal bank and like this has justified in the happened his relative inaccessibility, in comparison with other public institutions like the World-wide Bank, in questions of cooperation and of control in front of the administration.
We have struggled *duramente from the Commission of Control Budgetary during six years to be able to throw a glimpse to the accounts of the bank and yesterday reach at last an agreement on the control of the bank by the office against the fraud, the *OLAF.
The subject is of special importance, given the urgency of the subject, in the measure in that we no longer have excessive time to set up the new procedure, since the current system finishes to finals of the month of January and it is necessary to reach a bilateral agreement among the Bank and the Commission.
And it has promised to present a recommendation in the that will collect  #all the relative subjects to the public health, the health of the sporty youngsters, the health of the sportsmen in general, with seen to a big action *concertada of the States members in the fight against the doping.
Today we fulfil with our mandate, lady Speaker and *Señorías, because the Commission has decided to present a relative plan to a communication on the *salvaguardia of the current sportive structures and on the maintenance of the social function of the sport in the community frame.
Lady Commissioner, the congratulate by it that has had to see in relation with the set up of the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, although I also ask, as sporty, that, the same that they go  to impose to the athletes some strict norms in the subject of the doping -sew that *me seems very well-, *les listen to *ellos and put his interests above the economic and commercial interests, thing that no always has taken  up to now.
Gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, today the Union is an institution that did not respects the minimum principles of the democracy and of the State of right and by #this, to *nosotros, the radicals, federalistic Europeans, promoters of the States Joined of *Europa like the posed *Altiero *Spinelli, *nos results difficult to consider as true progresses the small, really small, reforms that appear in the diary.
Wail also that our proposal of resolution common do not mention the problems linked with *Eurodac, in the precise moment in the that the Council finishes to announce, in contradiction with the Treaties, that this organ #would have to follow being purely *intergubernamental, it that excludes to the Parliament and to the Court of Justice of #all control to the *respecto.
It is necessary to have care: #if in *Helsinki the Council and the Governments will not open the diary of the Conference to essential institutional subjects and already mature, will not be credible the speech on the enlargement and will put  of self-evident that do not knows  pose a vision *previsora of the development of the Union in #all his dimensions.
It treats  of a general problem and, therefore, go to include, no in the section of the enlargement, but in the agenda the general assembly of the summit, that so much the States members like the aspiring to the adhesion have to improve the fulfillment of the rights of the minorities.
Also there #be a section devoted to the priorities and to particular subjects of the human rights, as, for example, the rights of the woman, of the boys and of the minorities, #as well as the rejection of the pity of death and of the racism.
In opinion of the Commission, so as to offer a more complete panorama of the situation in matter of human rights in the field of the European Union, #would suit that the report considered in the future of way more balanced the three *pilares of the European Union.
The challenge that have for the next #millenium is to leave that the needs of the boys guide the social work in #all his forms, having like point of game the right of the boys to a father and to a mother and to grow in some safe familiar surroundings.
In the proposal of the relative Commission to the bottoms for the promotion of the economic and social development of *Turquía and the consolidation of the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía proposes  that #this *englobe the period 2000-2002 because *nos have dipped so much in this year that it has taken  too much late to establish new budgetary lines with this end in 1999.
The financial help to *Turquía #can not  separate of the commitments in the fields of the social development and of the democracy, of the State of Right and of the respect to the human rights and the rights of the minorities.
Gentleman President, feelings of solidarity and fraternity with the village of *Turquía *nos carry to be against of the entry of this country in the European Union, and *ello because, like the experience of the #greek village already has shown, the village of this country do not has at all positive that expect of #such entry.
Although I appreciate and I appreciate the contents of the Report *Morillon, consider that a strong signal has to be the to postpone this decision until the #turkish Government do not confirm the suspension of the pity of death and open a negotiation to solve the question *kurda.
To the contrary, the Commission of Environment wishes to leave clear with his proposal, that is more concrete and also more rigorous regarding the norms of exception, that #can not  admit a politics of environment of double road, but that the goal has to be achieve a high level of protection for #all the persons in the EU.
By this reason, there #be not at present plans to study the incorporation of other types of vehicles, for example the trucks, because it supposes  that his efficiency of combustion is high, or the vehicles of two tyres, by his scarce contribution to the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon.
Those that more auditions celebrate and more reports read on these subjects, more *me convince am that the tendency generalised is, on the one hand, to a drastic shortening of the period of transition of the double circulation of the national coin and of the euro and, by #another, to the materialisation of a period of *front-*loading advanced at least to 1 December 2001.
Rather, it #would compete by the title of greater construction *fallida of the world, as it goes directed to endow to the greater commercial block of the world of an only coin founded on a base that until his introduction only has been able to  sustain during a period of five years of the #postwar period in *Alemania.
I create, therefore, that with these two great modifications that have incorporated  in commission, beside #others, like a greater precision in the labeling and the information to the consumers, the Parliament contributes to avert that a text -that believe that has also his fine parts, as I already have signalled- #can have converted, by unreal, in dead letter swims more be born, and ask thus sincerely to #all the approval of this report.
Report (To5-0071/1999) of the Mr. *Morillon, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the relative Council to the actions directed to reach the economic and social development of *Turquía (*COM(1998) 600 - *C4-0670/1998 - 1998/0300(*COD))
Have the taste to give the welcome, in name of the European Parliament, to the members of a delegation of the #moroccan Parliament, headed by the President of the Council of the Moroccan Parliament, Mr. *Jalal *Essaïd, delegation that finishes to get to the grandstand of invited.
It has to  to that this law to amend the #italian Constitution has been presented to the Senate in three or four occasions and has bumped always with the opposition of the left, although #this has talked of filter on the possibility to change the law to allow his return.
It #would be it for the producers and the workers of the less favoured countries and no, as it has said , for the multinationals that, in spite of #everything, #would find, as they always have found, the channels to increase his industrial and commercial penetration in any place of the world.
The Court of Accounts has the task to check #if this goal reaches ; has the task to check #if the financial performance adjusts  to the disposals of the budgetary diet and gives to the Commission instructions about it that it is necessary to modify for an ordered budgetary execution.
An idea that in the countries of the north always has had rooting, in *Austria, in the #scandinavian countries, in *Alemania, also in *Inglaterra has existed always the question of the training of adults, but in the countries of the south has not been so rooted.
The Community has to encourage to ensure the hit of this plan of control, that to continuation will be an example for other regional organisations, and the support given by the Parliament to this proposal shows that, in this field and also in #others, gentleman President, and *usted knows it very well, share #the same point of sight.
These statements -is not of more remember it- refer , by a part, to that the deputy do not exerts #any of the charges enumerated in the article 6, incompatible with the mandate in the Parliament and, by #another, to that contain exact informations on the professional activities, rewards obtained or other functions exerted and any economic support, in personnel or in material.
Like the system of permissions contains a mechanism to deliver among the countries the no used permissions, #can reassure to the Parliament that it do not exists any risk that  *despilfarren or that they do not use  the permissions that have been attributed like part of the basic contingent.
Second I expect of *usted a clear demonstration about how much time more goes to last the dilatory manoeuvre of the Commission regarding the Novel Regulation *Feed, and #if it considers *usted timely, so that the users have at last clarity, support this proposal, in concrete tackle this moratorium, that besides already went partially formulated by the Council of Ministers.
The decision to follow boosting #all the possibilities of the technologies of the information to improve the competitiveness of the Union and the aspiration to that *Europa occupy the *primer place to world-wide level like society of the information are essential parts of the development of the economic security.
The politics of the European Union concerning the countries of this region is disintegrated Why do not takes advantage of the EU the existence of the *OSCE to reach a pact of stability for the *Cáucaso jointly with these countries, with the #russian Federation, the States Joined and *Turquía?
#If we contrast said propositions with the promise to concede the statute of candidate to *Turquía and the simultaneous announcement of the celebration of a conference in the that will not take part *Turquía in the spring of the 2000, jumps to the sight that the granting of said statute of candidate has been too much precipitated, that is a cheque in white in discovered.
It do not considers the Commission that the renewal of said public agreements contravenes the Directives on the procedures of adjudication of the public agreements of services (92/50/*CEE, 93/37/*CEE and 89/440/*CEE), in view of that it has not summoned  any public bidding and that any #another company of the EU has remained excluded of this important market?
With the vote in the Plenary to the planned hour -or was, the Thursday-, the Parliament will have fulfilled his obligation and issued punctually his *dictamen, with the end to guarantee in it that of *nosotros depends the relief without interruptions of the members of the Court and the necessary collaboration with #the same.
The new article 280 of the Treaty attributes also to the Court of Accounts new committed in the construction of a legal body that provide an equivalent effective protection against the fraud or #any one other illegal activities in the States members.
The Court of Appeal has revoked the *dictamen of an inferior court and has condemned to two men by *injuriar the flag in a peaceful demonstration, although the legislation of the territory includes the International Pact on the Civil Rights and Politicians.
To instance of the Commission already are taking part in the *preparativos of the content of the conference, that will take place in February. We expect to receive a similar signal by part of the Council put that this institution still has not pronounced  on the presence and the number of representatives of the European Parliament in New *York.
Proposal of regulation of the Council (*CE) on the distribution of the quantities of cereals foreseen in the title of the Agreement of Help Alimentary 1995 for the period of 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (*COM(1999) 384 - *C5-0258/1999 - 1999/0162(*CNS)) (Commission of Development and Cooperation)
The European Union, shaken besides by the resignation of the Commission *Santer in the course of the preparatory works, has followed a politics of research of commitments with the #others great powers, moving away of the claims of the countries in development and of the interests of the civil society.
Second, to #the same time that in the field of the car take  #a lot of efforts to reduce the pollution of the new engines, #would have to elaborate  a #european program very *voluntarista, to end to delete quickly the ancient car park, often very *contaminante (no *me refer to the cars of collection).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the continuation of the debate of the oral questions to the Commission and to the Council, in name of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, and on the course given by the Union to the program of action *Beijing.
The Commission took the caution to entrust these fears to his Managerial Committee Scientist so that *le gave an opinion on #if #this questioned the decision to raise the embargo and the terms of the plan of export in base to the date in particular.
Nevertheless, we cross, and I say it another time, a stage in *Europa in the that, perhaps, the feeding never have been so safe and, without embargo, the confidence of the consumers in the foods diminishes each day, no only in *Francia and in *Alemania, but also in other countries, due to the fact that this discussion lengthens  in absence of a political dynamism.
My opinion is that the additional negotiations and the protocol of agreement that reached  among #all the parts and experts involved offer new guarantees to the consumers of the European Union -and no #all are #french- that the meat of *vacuno exported according to the plan based in the date is so safe like any #another of the European Union.

No only by the fact that stood out North American jurists signal that here it #can exist a judicial error, as it #be to occur, but also because it treats  of a citizen of the EU, ask to the Commission and, of course, to this Parliament that take all it possible to convert this pity of death perhaps in a pity of chain perpetual or for *aplazarla in a *primer moment.

The resolution that today debate has to be a contribution more to put brake to the situation of the women of a country, *Afganistán, #where the diet of the Talibans is seeding, with his authoritarianism, the terror among the population and the international alarm.
For the #afghan women, the freedom of expression, the right to the work, the right to assist to courses on the health and the familiar planning, the access to the education, #all these things, #such as the know, simply do not exist.
In the case of *Nicaragua in this case sustain a distinct opinion of the of #others that have taken part here treats  unambiguously of the State of Right like #such and, therefore, that in a State of Right the individual has to be protected in front of the arbitrarinesses of the upper powers of the State.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, *Tayikistán no only is the poorest country of the resultant states of the ancient Soviet Union but also the that in the last five years has suffered more the eddy of the ethnic fights until #this have expanded  finally to a civil war.
Without embargo, the financial help in form of *empréstito #would have to award only #if it is possible in fact a suitable control of the financial help by part of the European Union, #if it continues the process of reconciliation national and #if they organise  of free and democratic way in March of the 2000 the elections, especially, the elections to the parliament.
Then it results obviously interesting to know #if the Council of Ministers of the EU is had to use his position and his can -although we give economic help for the development of *Marruecos- bear *presionar to the government of this country, so that it do not go back to call to a plebiscite that  *postergue for the future, but that really #this make .
Of compliance with the article 6 of the Protocol for the inclusion of the *acervo of *Schengen in the frame of the European Union, for the execution and back development of said *acervo, the Republic of *Islandia and the Realm of Norwegian will be associated on the base of the agreement signed on 19 December 1996 in *Luxemburgo.
True is that his experience of speaker and the so remarkable contribution to the advances of the European Union take that this text go to be a base of reflection indispensable for the next Commission of Institutional Subjects.
The Parliament by his side has answered to the Mr. *Herman with the approval of the modifications of the relative regulation to the votes and the amendments, #as well as with the reduction of the number of commissions on the that will decide still in this session of today.
The conclusion of said recommendation was, in *resumidos terms, that regarding the political criteria Malt do not presents problems, but that in the economic area sure enough need  some complementary or structural reforms, while this interruption of two years in the *preparativos of Malt for his adhesion has caused also some delay in his adoption of the *acervo community.
So that all #this #can regulate of form *jurídicamente coherent, also will have to adapt the field of application of the Regulation 17/62, and like this proposes it the Commission; finally, the Commission wants to introduce the possibility to exempt with retroactive strength from the date of his subscription those agreements that did not go presented individually, but yes have right to exemption.
In *tercer place, *me will refer to the idea of a code of fine administrative behaviour, that mentioned  by first time in the Report #Perry on the own activities of the Commission of Requests in 1996-1997 and that it was supported in the Report *Newman on the annual report of the Defender of the corresponding European Village to 1997.
Like this as, it did not is necessary *extrañarse that the application of the group of these absurd community norms believes a cumulus of difficulties, that give place to the presentation of resources in front of the Commission of Requests and the Defender of the Village.
In consequence, the Commission attributes #a lot of importance, at the end of this term of office, to the fact to put  to the day in the processing of the requests, so as to be able to examine, with occasion of the two last meetings of his Commission of Requests, chaired by the Mr. *Fontana, the greater part of the *dossiers still pending.
*Me #Unworthy the fact to ascertain that, *cuando #all the political parties, with exception of the extreme right, recognise in the arrest of *Pinochet the new virtues of an international justice, have followed  having a conversation with *Milosevic, although has the most bloodstained hands and that they weigh more «crimes against the humanity» on his consciousness.
In place to integrate in his breast to the ancient *Yugoslavia and favour, in this way, his political democratisation and his economic and social progresses, the European Union -with the European Parliament in command- has boosted his *desmembramiento and created, at least indirectly, the conditions so that they produced , yesterday, the wars of *Croacia and of *Bosnia and, today, the of Serbian.
The utilisation of vehicles private poses big quantity of regional and local problems that, of compliance with the principle of the subsidiariness, require a type of approach lightly different, that have been elaborating mainly by pipe of the program of action for the network of citizens.
Little afterwards, the members of the Commission of Transports and the representatives of the European Commission *deliberaron. After the consequent debate in the Commission of Transports, had to ascertain that the majority of his members did not has  *retractado of the position adopted two months ago.
Nevertheless, I create -and already it has said  here- that *nos find in front of the typical case in that a concept that in principle back and approve, to know the promotion of the transport combined so as to reduce the transport by roads and take advantage of the possibilities offered by the railway and the navigable roads, goes out bad unemployed person by cause of a specific measure.
In place to allow that the consumers benefit  of the competition, the current situation characterises  by the existence of a big diversity of prices with regard to the cards of credit, the loans *hipotecarios and other services -the communication contains indications very important in this sense-.
The debate on the control of the country of origin regarding the control in the country of reception has prevented up to now an important evolution to systems of #european control or to the establishment of a #european supervisory authority.
#This was reason of anxiety, since it did not is necessary to forget that, after three years of work, the program *DAPHNE needed, by a part, a solid juridical foundation and concrete before 1 January of the year 2000 and, by #another, the juridical foundation that *nos proposed #can not deny the political line that had originated it.
*B4-0391/99 of the deputies *Banotti and #others, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European-*B4-0398/99 of the deputy *Malone, in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists-*B4-0421/99 of the deputies *McKenna and #others, in name of the Group of the Greens in the Parliament *Europeosobre the murder of *Rosemary #Nelson.
We are not *hipócritas *erigiéndonos in teachers of these countries that are crossing a difficult fed up period. After all they finish to go out of #a lot of years of occupation foreign and dictatorship, *algo that always has gone accompanied of #one some disintegration of the moral structures.
We go to ask to the government that occupy  that #all the #cypriot citizens have freely of plural information so much on the advantages as on the problems of the adhesion to the equal that expect the celebration of a referendum to decide the belonging of the country to the EU.
It is truth, of course, that in spite of the *interrogantes specific that arouses in the relations among mandators and *mandantes in this end of century, the right of request is #one of the privileged means through the *cuales the Parliament exerts his control on the Commission and the Council -#as well as on the States members-, in benefit of the #european citizens.
To conclude, #would wish, to the sight of the big quantity of work that represents the processing of the requests received, support explicitly a review in depth of the methods of operation of the Commission of Requests, in #whose case is not difficult to comprise that #this interrogate  on the best way to face up to the task that *le *incumbe.
It did not fits the lower doubt that the resultant experiences of the initiative *DAPHNE will be beneficial to the hour to structure the new program *quinquenal. By means of this program will be possible to support the cooperation among the no governmental organisations and the local authorities.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, «the violence against the women is a problem of the men». The international day of the Woman, the Commissioner *Gradin invited precisely with these words to the men to take the word on the violence against the women.
Regarding this concrete look, believe that it runs  the risk that it remain  in a gesture of fine will, since they do not go to vary the current taxes of growth and that the already persistent unemployment goes to keep  in the future, an unemployment that, on the other hand, affects very especially to the youngest generations.
Gentleman President, the Commission continues his active politics with the end to reduce the dependency of the Community of the import of proteins vegetal and to increase the use of cereals in the *forrajes for the livestock.
The reform of the Common Agricultural Politics that undertook  in the year 1992 has given place to a considerable increase of the use of cereals in the *piensos, wall of twenty millions of tonnes to the year, #as well as an important fall of the import of *forraje and -especially- of vegetal proteins for the livestock.
The Commission has assumed always his responsibilities to the hour to guarantee the competitiveness of the #european industry of the starch, of his industry of processing and, in particular of the sector *biotecnológico that uses the starch and his derivatives like matter prevails.
Therefore, gentleman President, have estimated *proponerle, following our jurisprudence, following our norms established that the parliamentary immunity do not protects to the same member, but to #all the Assembly and to this Parliament, that do not suspend  the parliamentary immunity. #This say it in particular because we think, in the line of my illustrate precursors, #Georges *Donnez and #Jean *Defraignes, that treats  here in some mood of the «*fumus *persecutionis».
I think that there will be a *reforzamiento and a better follow-up of the relations among the Parliament and the Commission in matter of control of the budgetary management and expect that, with this regulation, our Parliament #can take a still better work in matter of control of the budgetary management of the Commission.
Therefore, the European Bank of Investments and the Bottom have to release more bottoms and, on the other hand, the States members have to have the possibility of *oxigenar his economy through his own budgetary politics, not taking the pact of stability even more strict but by means of a more flexible interpretation.
*Cuando #Everything concludes, wanted to express on my part the wish that this institution prosper, and so that it prosper *carecen of importance the old clashes among the Commission, the Parliament and the Council; #all joined have to take care this plant that now *brota, so that it #can *medrar and *fructificar, for well of the European Union and of his finances, and, especially, for well of the taxpayers, is to say, of the citizens of the European Union.
The reason of the resignation was, as it is known, the report of the Committee of Experts independent on the responsibility of the Commission and of individual members of the Commission by cases of fraud, corruption and nepotism that have produced  in the course of a series of years.
As it puts of relief the speaker for the procedure of approval of the management for 1997, our colleague, the Mr. *Brinkhorst, the administrative cooperation among the Commission and the States members, #as well as the of the States members among yes, has to take more intense put that the budget executes  to a large extent by the States members.
At the beginning of the month of December, following -it is necessary to remember- the position of the Socialist Group, the Commission of Control Budgetary decided without embargo recommend to the Plenary the granting of the approval of the management to the Commission.
On this approval of the management, on this report of our colleague, the Mr. *Brinkhorst, have elaborated also #some specific documents. I owe *decirles that am a so much irritated by the fact that we have not received, at all, any reaction of the current Commission to documents that shortly go to have three months.
Second, the question of the decentralisation and the transfer of competitions of the Commission, in particular in the sphere of the external programs, is extraordinarily important, but need norms very strict for the delegation of the management of the community politics and always have to  pursue actively.
And said #this, gentleman President, *nosotros *nos confront today to a change that *resume very well the philosophy of the Parliament, a change that, in words of the Commissioner Mr. Ear, endows, from the first of May, to the European Union «of an instrument more *performante, more opened to the dialogue with the citizens, more democratic and more projected to the external world».
It has to have a serious debate among the scientists of both sides of the Atlantic, because I do not believe that the States Joined are indifferent in relation with the health of his citizens: they are not still convinced that it exist a danger and, #if we have of proofs, is adapted *presentarlas to the States Joined and to the rest of the world.
Without embargo, *me see forced to call his attention on the fact that the permission to apply a type reduced is a disposal that *atañe to the harmonisation of the relative legislations to the Tax on the Value Added, contemplated in the article 93 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, ancient article 99.
Roman *Prodi is a *europeísta convinced, a *reformador economic and politician of tested hit, a politician *avezado in administrative subjects, that contributes likewise the necessary vicinity to the citizens, and after listening his previous intervention *yo wanted to add also that it is a candidate that *aúna the vision of a project, the sense of the reality, the pragmatism and a clear consciousness of the needs.
#If *ustedes, in his quality of deputies of the European Parliament, take #his the proposal of the Bosses of State and of Government and approve the day after tomorrow the nomination of the Mr. *Prodi, the Governments will proceed to continuation, as following step, to designate of common agreement with the President nominated to the personalities that propose  appoint like members of the Commission.
Finally, it is necessary that approve  a reform directed to increase the transparency so that the Parliament, at least, have access to a document of the so prompt Commission like #this deliver it to a committee, to a company, to a country, to a journalist or to any #another person that do not form part of the institution.
It adds  likewise the important subject of the effort to convert in more dynamic the #european economy -in his speech appear #a lot of indications to the *respecto- inside a balance that has to be new, but that it has to exist, is to say, the balance of character social of the #european economy.
In effect, in his statements prevails an idea of development understood like continuous growth without loaning attention to the natural limits of the resources: an infinite growth is a dangerous utopia of the economists that #can not find an answer in the reality.
It has been missing an action in the past, but also in his intervention, with regard to how warn the conflicts and #can not forget that the #italian Government that *usted chaired, in #one of his last decisions, on 12 October 1998, put to disposal of the NATO the #italian bases with seen to a possible war in *Kosovo.
Said amendments of commitment no *surtirán the effect expected, is to say, limit the negative consequences for the consumers and the producers of honey #european of a regulation that do not protects sufficiently the quality of the fine #european honeys against the honeys mattered and, it that it is worse, that favours the fraud.
I #can not by less that regret that the Commission and the Council have not followed the example of the Parliament, that approved by unanimity my two reports on the situation of the #european apiculture and on the improvement of the production and of the commercialisation of the honey.
So much the States members like the Commission have coincided in underlining that any delay in the adoption of the strategy #can give place to false interpretations by #russian part and *yo believe that to #all *nos interests that they do not intensify  the tensions among the European Union and *Rusia in the complex international situation current.
The new institution, «the gentleman or the external political lady», has to have a predominantly preventive function and collaborate with the *OSCE, the UN, etc. #All #can regret not to have it reached in the *Balcanes and that at the end was necessary the intervention, without embargo, also is necessary to signal that we have to be had to *ello *cuando produce  rapes so grave and evident of the human rights.
But there #be an amendment of the liberal Group, that #a lot of deputies think to support, in the *cual proposes  -on the base of the text that the Council *nos has offered in the contrary sense- an alternative text that believe #can obtain the approval of the Council.
Gentleman President, #can not  talk of the Statute of the deputy and of it that #this means today without taking an effort for containing a true dose of indignation, caused by the climate in the *cual have developed  the debates, under the pressure of the complaints formulated in #some media, that have caused a true distortion in the discussions.
Never I have understood to the socialists, that in a principle demand a big increase of the *gravámenes for the utilisation of roads, but that afterwards throw  backwards in front of the requirement that the Parliament, in his big majority, believed correct in the year 1997 and that it was more elevated of it that the Council has proposed now.
Said writing was inscribed in the register of entrance of the post of the European Parliament the past 12 April, and *me announce that they expect that the official announcement of the register #can formulate  next Monday 3 May, the day before yesterday, in the opening of the Plenary of the European Parliament.
The creation of an identity of security and of #european defence is now the central element of the process of integration #european after the creation of the inner market and of the Economic and Monetary Union.
The process of *Luxemburgo consolidates  and begins to give his fruits in terms of national politics for the most systematic employment, more integrated, more ambitious and, to initiative of the #german Presidency, will step supplementary in the road of this #european Pact by the employment, of the that *yo recommended his application already in January of 1996.
The only question that  *nos poses is #if, taking into account the reduction that has taken  of the financial perspectives of the 2000 to the 2006, the European Union goes to have in the next years of sufficient resources for an own politics of the employment, since practically #all the community politics have had to be *recortadas.
But, even in the supposed that #all these worries went object of examination with seen to the Summit of the bosses of State or of Government, will not suppose a sufficiently adapted answer to the gravity of the crisis of *Kosovo and no *suplirán the patent absence of *Europa in this specific flank of the continental actuality.
Colony has to give a signal also in this field to make this economic politics that establish the goals that have to reach as, for example, a different relation with the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the relaunching of the quality of the #european product, the no *imposición of the companies.
In the agricultural politics, thanks to a more intense orientation to the world-wide market and to the environment, the agriculture in the countries candidates to the adhesion obtains already today some important foundations of planning for the orientation of his agricultural production.
After the resignation of the Commission, after the problems of fraud and of bad economic management, how #can justify the majority of this Parliament that this Assembly reveal  unable to reform any thing that have relation with our assignments and the financial management of this institution?
I urge to the Commission so that it take  really seriously his function of control and carry out in his programs the marked goals in the new regulation -develop sustainable, promotion of the employment, promotion of the equality of opportunities of women and men, improvement of the environment and of the small and medium enterprises-, and that do not retreat again in front of the States members.
It is a package of bottoms to launch to our regions to the new #millenium, seven years of support for our communities and regions more *marginadas that need our commitment and our community solidarity, for the youngsters, for the unemployed of long length and for the women repatriated: persons that want to have active part in the regeneration of *Europa.
The work that have taken in representation of the Parliament in this report, in narrow contact with my colleagues -the Mr. #Walter and the Mr. *Sonneveld-, has treated precisely to coordinate #all this process of help and, besides, to include the criteria of the Parliament.
*Tercer Point: here it do not treats  of the question of the granting in the sense of justice or injustice or of the envy but that the pressure of prices that exert the exploitations that follow living with an excess of compensation by the high payment of premiums, will affect to the small *amenazándolas in his existence.
With the new introduction of measures for the rural areas and with the strengthening of the measures of accompaniment existent from the reform of 1992, has given  another step to a global agricultural politics for the rural areas.
*Yo Believe that this message encloses a double danger: first, because it puts of self-evident, in mouth of the author of the reform, that the current measures of reform will not be sufficiently effective, and #this even before applying ; and second, because it is not possible that the agriculturalist and the #european grazier develop his activity and schedule his future without a frame of minimum stability.
A time that have implanted  the relative Regulation to the Social Bottom for the new period, the Social Bottom *recobrará new life thanks to that takes  greater upsetting in the dimension of the employment in #all the community politics and in the structural Bottoms in particular.
Because it is crucial. Of it contrary, will not constitute the bananas a precedent so that other pertinent products of other less developed countries lose his markets, and #would not give *ello place, on a long-term basis, to amendments to the world-wide system of the trade to protect to the poor against the multinationals?
#This illustrates the point contained in the question of the Mr. deputy that the diet of *Sadam *Husein uses the situation of need of the civil population to impose the suspension of the sanctions without fulfillment of the conditions of the Resolution 687 of 1991 on the armistice.
Gentleman President, according to the article 7 of the Protocol, that integrates the *acervo of *Schengen in the Annex to the Treaty of *Amsterdam in the frame of the European Union, the Council agrees with majority qualified the details of the integration of the Secretariat of *Schengen in the General Secretariat of the Council.
Subject: The interpretation in the Council According to data of the agency of #news *TT of 30 March 1999, in the meetings of the Council three of each four #swedish representatives see  forced to use a foreign tongue in the negotiations.
Subject: Agreement with *Croacia Taking into account that, as a result of the clashes armed in the neighbouring countries, the economy and the tourism of *Croacia have resulted considerably damaged and that the country has seen  militarily loomed, the celebration of an agreement of trade and cooperation with *Croacia #can contribute decisively to the stability of #all the region.
These looks of the initial proposal have been modified after a negative vote of the Parliament takes some months and, of this way, the final proposal establishes a unitary instrument of intervention in the sector of the fishing.
Likewise we regret that in relation with the possibilities of cooperation national do not yield  the election of the zones of the Goal 2 that remain out of the strict criteria to the States members, but that, as before, remains limited by the Commission through some criteria and a reservation of consent.
It is fundamental to guarantee that #all the regions with communities *pesqueras follow having an every time greater access to the structural bottoms for the sector of the fishing without that produce  any attempt for reducing the levels of finance or for excluding said access increasing the complexity of the procedures.
As already it has signalled  in the course of this debate, the system provides obviously an important bond among the Commission and the representatives of the national authorities presents in the committees and that assist to the Commission in his executive function.
Of course, the Commission will follow contributing actively in this work with the hope to be able to get to an agreement, before it finalise the #german Presidency, that satisfy to the three institutions and that, therefore, *redunde in benefit of the citizens of the Union, to those who have to serve, and that will be undoubtedly by millions awaiting awake to these hours of the night the result of this debate.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the report (To4-0261/99) of the Mrs. *Jöns, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the agreement mark on the work of length determined celebrated by the *UNICE, the *CEEP and the *CES (*COM(1999)0203 - *C4-0220/1999).
The #german Presidency recognises fully that the integration of the *acervo of *Schengen in the frame of the EU *reviste a special importance of face to the future activities of the European Parliament and understands that the Parliament have #a lot of interest in following of wall the previous steps to said integration.
The agreement establishes, besides, that a considerable part of the disposals of the *acquis of *Schengen, especially the disposals that have to see with the free circulation of persons, asylum, immigration and border controls,  *comunitariza in his greater part and, therefore, the Parliament and the Court of Justice will see  involved in the future in the development of this politics.
*Señorías, #if we want to struggle against the increasing illegalities, is necessary that the that offer services through the network are able to facilitate #all the necessary information to look for and find to the providers of contents illicit respecting, as it is obvious, it that has the community Right regarding the respect of the personal data.
In this moment debate a directive, that is the relative directive to determined juridical looks of the electronic trade in the inner market, that treats to harmonise determined looks of the Right of the States members through this procedure -a directive- that, in reality, are looks of private Right.
As it occurs always that it has  a subject that interests to #a lot of groups of pressure, #one of the problems that arise is that the groups of pressure cancel  #one to #others, which shows how the deputies of the European Parliament have to be able to face up to the that exert the pressures, to the equal that have to be able to face up to the journalists.
In matter of responsibility of the operators of networks in line, the initial proposal of the European Commission, without denying the relative problems to the illegality of the content, distinguishes the responsibility of the different actors, in function of his real activity.
The limitation of responsibility affects to #all the on-line illegal activities of third, #such like disloyal competition, deceptive advertising, but also to the piracy in the field of the right of author, like this deduces  of the explanation of the proposal of the Commission.
It is also the case of the amendments that try to modify the field of application of the directive of a way that is not coherent with other directives on services of the society of the information (amendments *núms. 27 and 63) and of the amendment 31, that modifies the definition proposed of the commercial communications.
*Nos Cheer that, together with the texts of the new Regulations, have seated the bases for an effective collaboration in the management of the bottoms, also thanks to the Code of behaviour among the Commission and the Parliament with regard to the application of the structural politics.
The contingent of 600 representatives of the Nations Joined to organise and observe the process *referendario is constituted by civilians disarmed, to the that in his moment will add  also 250 also disarmed policemen, without possibility #any to defend to nobody, neither to himself/hisself same, in front of the activity *impune of the militias *prointegracionistas that seed the terror in *Dili and in the rest of the territory.
*B-0462/99 of the deputies #Harrison and #others, in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists-*B4-0491/99 of the deputies *Pasty and go *Bladel, in name of the Group Union by *Europa-*B4-0506/99 of the deputy *Telkämper, in name of the Group of the Greens in the Parliament *Europeosobre the political manipulation of the trials in *Malasia;
And, second, the Council #be to agree a formula that will provide a juridical base for the remote access to a terrestrial season for satellites that there #be in #Italia by means of the introduction of a new clause in the project of agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal questions.
The present proposal basically takes case *omiso of the European Agreement for the Protection of the Human Rights and of the Fundamental Freedoms and of the disposal that appears in the article 8 on the protection of the private life of the persons.
Finally, it wanted to take #this like reason to appeal again to the Council so that we are proud no only by it that take in the cultural field, but also by *preocuparnos that these programs find a suitable finance, because it do not reaches  at all #if we excite to the public with these wonderful programs of the European Union but afterwards *les assign a ridiculous financial endowment.
After the exhibition of the year 2005, for my big joy, have been already assigned to *Japón, specifically to *Nagoya, wanted to *recordarles that in the exhibition of *Osaka got  to a series of errors bureaucratic scandalous, and *cuando had built  already a pavilion of *Europa, denied  to plant the statue of *Coudenhove-*Kalergi.
To fault of a positive action of the Commission, #whose plan of #tending action to strengthen the competitiveness of the sector, that examine in 1998, has not had up to now a concrete result, #some States members, as *Francia, *España, *Portugal, have taken measures to brake the escape of places of work to the third countries.
*Usted Has been Vice-president under my Presidency and the that have followed, and has won  in this house a big appreciate by his work, first like Vice-president, especially in the delicate votes, but also, of very ancient, by his #european commitment, that *nos has carried to collaborate in other tasks and other claims.
His big energy after #one *Europa free and joined politically, his respect to the democratic institutions, his creed in a Parliament that keep at last a strong relation, conscious and transparent with the Commission, no *nos leave more that expect some years in that at last the *asociacionismo of *antaño remain *relegado to the past and begin a true collaboration among #all the Groups of this Parliament.
Lady Speaker, in name of the Group of the Green/ Free Alliance European, wanted to *sumarme to the term that *usted has fixed so that the second inform of the Wise persons was in hands of #all the members of the European Parliament before 30 August, is to say, before they give beginning the audiences with the new Commission.
The Federal Government German #would have wished, of course, greater progresses in #some fields, as for example in the Agricultural Politics, field in the that it will be indispensable to tackle very prompt new reforms with reason of the round of the *OMC, but in spite of #all the commitment in his group constitutes a very fine base, an extraordinary base for the entrance of the Union in the century *XXI.
Under the #german Presidency of the Council was foreseen the transposition of the Diary 2000, an ambitious project of reform, with the end to deepen the integration of *Europa and prepare to the EU for the enlargement to the East by means of some substantial reforms.
Gentleman President, the Greens think that during the century *XXI the paper of the no violent methods for the solution of conflicts #would have to be more important that the of the military interventions and that the strength, that *excepcionalmente #can be necessary, only exerted  previous mandate of the UN.
The #european public has lost his confidence in the national authorities and #european attendants of the control of the medicines and of the control of foods; no longer  *fía neither of the Government neither of the Governments neither neither of the scientists.
This precise goal a strong synergy among the Commission and the Parliament, a Parliament that has the democratic representation of the #european citizens and that, therefore, has to offer a fundamental contribution to the reforms of the #european Institutions.
The increase of the sessions to open doors of the Council, the facilitation of the access to the documents and the publication of the diary of meetings and of agendas of the different committees and commissions boost of concrete form the principle of transparency.
With regard to the process against *Öcalan: the Commission shares the opinion issued on 29 June by the #german Presidency of the Council after the Court of Security of the State condemned to death to *Abdulah *Öcalan and expresses again his basic rejection to the pity of death.
So my question to the President in exercise of the Council and to the Commission is the following: until how point have *meditado in depth on the political measures and the economic and financial commitments that result necessary to build a Serbian free and democratic and *reintegrar the Serbian free and democratic to the economy and the political body Europeans?
In this look *me #one to the here presented postures pleading by the security of the defenders of the freedom of expression and also to the reflections on the different means with the that we #can contribute to the materialisation of this freedom of expression in the country in question.
And we are not judging only to a Commissioner that has had an unacceptable behaviour, are talking of an ancient member of this Assembly, a distinguished member of parliament that went even president of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, of a #ex minister of Economy of *Alemania and of a Commissioner with a long leaf of services.
I believe that *cuando #this *perseverantes colleagues resolve in this case that has posed  in front of the Court of Justice, and advance  to the events failing without celebrating dress #any that are in front of a clear rape of the object of the article 213 and that withdraw  to this man his rights of pension,  *arrogarán a function that competes to the courts.
When talking of the pollution of the dioxin it is necessary to say that the investigations of the #belgian authorities and the inspections of the Commission indicate that the pollution produced  when adding  a no adapted substance in the process of manufacture.
Before happening to treat the approach agreed in the Council of Agriculture wanted to *recordarles the effective and timely performance set up by the Commission and supported by the Permanent Committee of Veterinary Medicine of the countries members, performance by the that established  #all the measures of exception required by the principle of prevention.
I expect that it bear #this *Bélgica #can have the solidarity of the Union, because it is clear that do not matters #if a crisis like #this have been caused by an illness, by an accident or even by a criminal act. To the consumer, to the agriculturalist or to the company that have been the victim *le will give the same.
Therefore, the States members have to give, or have to go back to give, to the Commission, a clear and firm mandate so that #this was the spur of #one *renegociación intelligent of the rules of the *GATT, that today day constitute an obstacle to the application of the principle of caution in the sanitary and alimentary fields.
We have to be able to say, as it takes the motion of the Socialist Group, that has to *imperar the principle of legality, that are a Community of Right, and that unless we take a universal application of #this, it that never took  with the derivative rule of the *EEB, the situation will not be able to improve.
To the hour to evaluate the situation, consider decisive to have of a more global vision of the question, #as well as treat to find solutions that, in the field of the elasticity of the structure, #can *evidenciar #some looks related with the problems of these territories of the south of #Italia.
Without embargo, #if *usted reads the Regulation will check that in the paragraph 6 of the article 170 says  that the constitution of the mixed commissions -that they are *algo distinct to the delegations *interparlamentarias-, is to say, that the constitution of the mixed commissions with the countries associated has to make under #the same conditions that the constitution of the commissions.
In the taking of this decision, the Commission took into account the fact that it did not exist any previous decision of the Commission neither any precedent of the Court of Justice that served of reference in the case of the *CFO with regard to his politics of sale of entrances.
Given the circumstances, therefore, is not #willing, gentleman Commissioner, to recognise that the fans to the football will think that the fine of 1.000 euros is absolutely ridiculous -that it is it that paid  roughly in the #black market by an entrance for the party *Inglaterra-Argentinian-, that the *revendedores of entrances will think that it is a fine news and that the true fans to the football will feel  disappointed?
I believe that #if #this had produced  in the sector of the telecommunications or in any #another, the idea that we went back with a symbolic fine in circumstances in that #some have increased his benefits in 200 or 300 millions of pounds #would have been so ridiculous as *le seems to the fans to the football the symbolic fine.
In effect, continues the Commission of Subjects Constitutional: "The statement of constitution of this Group, in particular the annex 2 of the letter of constitution, directed to the President of the European Parliament, excludes #all political affinity.
It will correspond to the new Commission establish a deeper assessment of this second inform and, to this *respecto, the responsible Vice-president of the reform of the Commission, the Mr. *Kinnock, will answer along the debate to the most concrete points that pose  to the future.
For frustration of #that of the Commission and of this Assembly that have promoted the reform, and finish to listen to the Mr. *Dell'#Alba, the advances that have made  until the moment have been sporadic and no *preconcebidos and have not been put in practice like consequence of the management of a program of change.
I do not want to anticipate the debate of the Thursday, but wanted to say already with #all clarity that, for example, the relative discussion to the creation of the Agency of Reconstruction in *Kosovo aims in this direction so much regarding the juridical situation as regarding the administrative structures that have foreseen .
It is necessary to remember, for example, that only four States have ratified the Agreement of the European Union on the cooperation in the fight against the fraud in the European Union and that in these moments, therefore, there #be not juridical foundation to struggle against the fraud.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5­0003/99) of the Mrs. *McKenna, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer on the proposal of decision of the Council by the that establishes  a community frame of cooperation in matter of accidental marine pollution.
After having doubted a bit, *me have left to convince by the arguments of the Mrs. #Jackson to fix in a directive some minimum criteria for the environmental inspections and not to limit to the proposal of the European Commission of a recommendation no *vinculante.
#A lot of colleagues also have formulated questions on the suitability to separate the #ex competition in front of on the budgetary control of the #ex competition *post on the application or formulation of the budget in the breast of the Commission.
I think mainly in a statement that has taken the ambassador of States Joined takes #some days in front of the European Union in the that cheers  that the group of work *biotecnológico of transatlantic economic association have got to a project of agreement on the processes of approval of new varieties *transgénicas.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the long path for the nomination #be to finish: it finishes a period agitated from the point of sight institutional of the life of the Union, a period that has allowed to the Parliament express his potentialities and reaffirm with conviction his democratic vocation.
Gentleman President designated of the Commission, have valued his statement regarding the enlargement of the European Union and the reform of the Institutions, #as well as the consolidation and the economic growth of #all the Union, and the sustainable development to create new places of work.
#If we want to recover the confidence of the citizens and the citizens need transparency in relation with the execution of the budget of the EU in #all his details, felt of the responsibility in the handle of the bottoms of the taxpayers and budgetary efficiency in the application of the community politics.
The Mrs. *Diamantopoulou, #whose wallet also includes the equality of opportunities, in addition to the employment and the social dimension, has given samples of a big commitment but, how will be able to act, gentleman *Prodi, #if *usted already the has gagged of entrance and has left in other hands the fight against the violence and the discrimination?
Lady Speaker, like the previous orators, believe that the creation of a judicial space European, by a part, and the instauration of norms general for the control of the immigration, by #another, in mood #any will solve the problems of the delinquency *transfronteriza neither of the immigration.
It has to conclude, as, that independently of the question that treat , already was the asylum, the immigration, the migratory flows, *Europol or the Letter of the fundamental rights, exists a direct relation among each #one of the #european citizens and the subject of interest.
Lady Speaker, after the problem of the work, the most urgent demand that the #european citizens formulate to the community Institutions is the to face up to the need of security that, by his characteristics, #can not be resolved *autónomamente by each #one of the States members.
It Only that pretend to say with #this is that to the *traspasar the competitions to a level determined logically also have to move the legal obligations and the own competitions of the parliamentary cooperation #as well as the rights of decision corresponding to the level that it treats  because, of it contrary, #would create  a legal gap and member of parliament.
In *Tampere will give  also political orientations on delicate questions, like the politics of immigration, that require a new approach of the relations North-South; like the free circulation, that requires a true harmonisation of the politics in matter of granting of visas in *Europa; like the right of asylum and the right to the health for #all the refugees.
A time begun the process to achieve some minimum rules, #can combine  with terms, creating like this a strength that promote to the achievement of a reliable juridical field, which is a requirement so that the citizens #can circulate freely, with security and confidence, but also to create guarantees of security to the hour of the enlargement.
Finally, because it takes  of the public relief of this new #european space the stone of touch of the confidence of the citizens without reducing the problem to the traditional controversy "freedom against security", but that recognises  the magnitude of the new imperative and worries #whose resolution expect of *Europa the #european citizens.
The Council expressed the day before yesterday his deeper indignation in front of this performance and also in front of the attempts that they have been object so much the citizens of *Timor Oriental, like the workers of organisations humanitarian, the representatives of the Church and the defenders of the human rights.
Also it is very stimulating the wish of the Mr. *Prodi to boost the enlargement of the Community, to give the maximum priority to the creation of places of work, and to work in narrow collaboration with the Parliament in the Conference *Intergubernamental.
But in reality, am optimistic because I believe that #one #can familiarise  quite well with this matter, in spite of the words of #some of our colleagues that compare the Commission of Budgets with a market of livestock, giving to understand that the resources move  of a side for #another and that sometimes the documentation is worse prepared that the that presents  in any municipal assembly.
Alas this government has had #a lot of friends in this Parliament during years and years, and #a lot of governments of the European Union have given priority to the lucre of his industries of armaments concerning the fundamental human rights of the miserable village of *Timor oriental.
*Me Gives the impression of that *él, to the equal that the spokesman of his delegation, Mr. *Galeote, has diverted the turn of questions to the Council to take an unacceptable personal disqualification to a colleague that has expressed political opinions entirely respectable.
Estimated gentleman *Korakas, *cuando get to the questions that has decided  answer in common, *yo *le will give an explanation, but have to follow an order, have to respect this order so that the session #can have a good end and *yo am not had to consent that there #be more previous questions or of order that prevent the normal operation of the turn of questions.
Since the ideas on the Union are so different and that the interpretations of the decisions of Colony are so contradictory in different places of the Union, #can not  say then clearly that "yes, are advancing to a common defence" or well "no, there will be a common defence" ?
In October of 1998, the Council requested to the Presidency that proposed common positions, according to the article *K.3 of the *TUE, in relation with the project of Convention of the Nations Joined and his Protocols. Of this way, the Council pretended to contribute to the negotiation and avert contradictions among the future convention and the community instruments.
To be the case, has taken already the Presidency in exercise the initiative to inscribe this point in the agenda of the General Assembly of the next autumn or has intention to take it in the next days with arrangement to other modalities of procedure?
The Council has decided recently continue his politics in this sense in #all type of forums *multilaterales and present for the first time a project of resolution for the pity of death in the session *nº 54 of the General Assembly of the Nations Joined.
Gentleman President, the Council has taken postures in diverse occasions on the negotiations in matter of the world-wide trade and in reference to the " Round of the #Millenium" ; the last time, in the conclusions of the meeting of the Council of Subjects General, the 21 and 22 June 1999.
*Ello #Would improve the paper of the Parliament, that already receives a quarterly report on the activities of the agency and has the important mission to approve the management of the director of the agency in the application of the budget.
#Can reinforce  perfectly the collaboration in the civil and penal subjects there #where was necessary, respecting fully the tradition of the International and Civil right, the democratic rights, ensuring the traditional principles of the material right and of the procedural right.
Thus, the Commission has made, and will follow making, profitable efforts to help to *Rusia in his arduous transition by means of actions as it is to centre the technical assistance in the fight against the bleaching of money and the crime organised, and support the efforts to advance in the state of right in general.
Lamentably, neither in the agreement *Kumanov concluded among the NATO and the #yugoslav Government neither neither in the resolution of the UN that has awarded the mandate for the international presence in *Kosovo, mentions  with an alone word the situation of the #albanian prisoners in *Belgrado and of the missing.
It is necessary to recognise, gentleman President, that this building has an important structural defect: in relation with the building of *Bruselas supposes for the deputies the decrease of his dispatches, no by the square metres that #can have of less each dispatch but by the fact that they have to share it in #all his activities with the assistant.
Affected by a crisis of the *cual *ellos are not the cause and of the *cual neither control his consequences, the #belgian agriculturalists expect on the other hand that the #european solidarity concretise , that this crisis of the dioxins recognise  like *epizootia, to #the same level that the crisis of the "crazy cows" in Big *Bretaña.
On this subject have a Green Book, go to have a White Book and 800 directives, but the bottom of the question, the reality, is that #this is a consequence of the politics and the decisions *economicistas that have taken  in *Europa, and of the globalisation.
Besides, the inept form to tackle these questions by part of the respective governments and of the own EU has undermined gravely the public confidence in the capacity of the politicians to tackle these crises in the alimentary chain.
Memory, afterwards that #others, that the project of budget of 2000 foresees a spectacular fall of our help, a reduction of two thirds of the credits of commitment that will happen of 16,5 to 5,5 millions of euros, in the same moment in that it that imposes  is precisely a reinforcement of the international mobilisation.
Some better statistical and a better knowledge by part of the rest of the world of it bad that is the situation #can be #some of the factors that increased the understanding of our populations about the need to make greater efforts in favour of *África, also in the general plane. As this problem is related with the grave situation of *África.
The review of the financial perspectives is in any case *algo significant also by other reasons and is related totally with *aquello in that it founds  the question of the reasons of the finance, is to say, that the war of *Kosovo has caused a situation that is surprising and new, for the that had not taken  reservations in the financial forecasts.
It wanted to also, in my first appearance in front of this Assembly, insist once again in *algo that already took in the Commission, and is in the need to establish the best possible relations among my responsibilities in the Commission and the managers of this Assembly in the corresponding subjects.
The amendment 3, especially a time adopted the document of work of the services of the Commission on the campaign of takeoff, that has been transmitted to the Parliament and to the Council, no only accepts  but that the Commission *les gives the graces and the receives with big satisfaction.
Gentleman President, #would wish to go back to congratulate to the Mr. *Langen by his contribution to the continuation and consolidation of the program *ALTENER, since it do not is necessary to forget that this program is our main instrument, although no financial, to carry out the strategy of the European Union on the renewable energies.
This intellectual political-isolation, the economic sanctions and the material outlay every time greater that demanded the maintenance of the old order finished conducting to the economic stagnation and to the political recognition that this situation #can not continue.
It is of common sense that #if this agreement was ratified by the national parliaments #whose main function, and say it among parenthesis, is once again verified, #all third country #can use a denomination of origin controlled #european with the end to negotiate afterwards a financial transaction.
After a meeting among the two parts, celebrated to the beginning of September, the European Union considers that the agreement has that the #south african do not have to follow using the denominations "Port" and "Sherry" after the period established of twelve years, by it that it is necessary, from this time on same, think in substitutive names for the #south african products that it treats .
I expect sincerely that this agreement, seen from the concrete angle of the cooperation for the development, contribute to the eradication of the poverty and the promotion of the prosperity in *Sudáfrica with full respect of the democratic principles and the fundamental human rights.
But I finish of *decirle, #if #such Government or #another -sure enough, no only affects to #Grecia: they have produced  catastrophes or shaken of diverse intensity in other countries, but of lower gravity- now well, #if #such or *cual Government requests it, *nosotros #can help and fund with charge to the Structural Bottoms the studies of prevention that #would allow to know the existent risk in places inhabited, as it mentioned *usted same in his question, but also for the factories, with the secondary risks of industrial catastrophe that *ello #would involve.
My question based  in a visit that took three weeks ago to *Belgrado and in renewed contacts that took the past week with the democratic strengths, with #all the political parties in the opposition, with humanitarian organisations, etc. that sent signals of help to counter the bad image of the rest of the world that propagates *Milosevic.
The Commission asked also to his Scientific Committee of Veterinary Measures related with the Public Health that issued a *dictamen on the possible negative effects for the human health of the administration of the six hormones with seen to intensify the growth of the animals.
Before the case *Öcalan nobody put in cloth of trial the optimum relations with a State that always had declared his will to keep an increasingly narrow cooperation with the Community until the point to ask his adhesion to #the same.
Precisely the military line invariably hard of *Ankara in front of the question *kurda, in spite of the call to the dialogue by part of the PKK that includes the renunciation to the fight armed, underlines the utility and need to contrast the situation with the criteria of evaluation.
*Me Pleases to inform, therefore, that the President *Arafat has backed the report #make recently on the strengthening of the #palestinian institutions, elaborated by an independent operative group sponsored by the Council of Relations External with an important help of the European Union.
The political benefit of the genetic investigation for the humanity sees  gravely eroded by the interests created, that take an use of the technology that is not compatible with the sustainable development, and that often goes in in conflict with the acceptable ethical norms.
To the hour to examine these fields, is especially important that analyse the problems that will have to surpass in these sectors: for example, the index of growth that at present is of the 13% in the EU, it that shows the capacity and the scope of the regulation negotiated; #as well as his complexity.
I believe that #if we develop our own agricultural production, the States members of the Union will be competitive in the sector, perhaps no so much in the prices, but it is necessary to take into account the quality and also the fact that the importance of the autochthonous production grows increasingly among the consumers.
For example: for #one of the main producers of tomatoes of Big *Bretaña that at present pays 363.000 pounds by his consumption of gas and 60.000 pounds by his consumption of electricity, the introduction of the tax proposed of the climatic change in Big *Bretaña #would increase his receipt of the light in 149.000 pounds.
I call the attention of our colleagues on the danger that supposes for the credibility of our Parliament the excessive utilisation of this procedure of urgency, especially *cuando treats , as in this case, to examine a text elaborated by an external organism.
In what it refers  to the function of the Commission, wanted to *recalcar that up to now, basing in the Article 296, the States members have exempted to the trade of arms of the field of application of the norms of the Treaty, it that has prevented #all intervention of the Community.
To request of the Council, the Commission is preparing a communication on the congestion and the delays of the aerial traffic and there #be not doubt that it will occupy  of this question again and will propose initiatives in the sphere of the management of the aerial space.
Without wanting to *adelantarme to the decision of the Assembly, call the attention on the fact that the Conference of Presidents has included this point in the agenda of the Friday because the Thursday is foreseen a meeting of the experts on said subject.
Lady Speaker, to end to avert any misunderstanding and ambiguity regarding the functions and respective competitions of an Institution like the European Parliament and of an Office as it is the *OLAF, wish to underline that so much in the *quinto considering as in the separated second of the article 1 affirms  without shadow of doubt that have  *salvaguardado and respected fully the disposals of the Treaties in general and, in particular, of the Protocol on the privileges and the immunities.
It #would have to *habernos surprised -since #this do not exists in #a lot of parliamentary democracies- the fact that the deputies of the Assembly chosen #can be controlled by an organ that depends in greater or in lower measure of the executive, and although, in this case, the *OLAF is controlled by a committee of control independent, is directed by a manager designated by the Commission.
The #another subject very important in the project of budget is the strengthening of the resources of the Court of Justice of the EU, that results especially visible in the improvement of the conditions of utilisation of the services of translation.
After these measures, is to expect that the Court #can execute much better his work, reduce the number of texts no translated and serve with greater efficiency to the States members, the citizens and the companies, in the interpretation and the application of the community legislation.
The Commission proposes that the necessary bottoms fund , in the first place, by means of a redistribution inside #the same *rúbrica of measures of external politics, second, using a minimum part of the reservation of flexibility and, in *tercer place, by means of a redistribution among the politics in the different fields, which will force to modify the financial perspectives.
The Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary (*ECON) considers that this effort follows being an absolute priority of the politics and that still is necessary to make a big work until they put  in circulation the notes and the coins in the European Union.
And it is necessary to remember also that the Council of *Berlín approved the financial perspectives after an extraordinarily complicated consensus, with some initial positions very distant among the Governments and, besides, with a European Commission resigned and a European Parliament at the end of his term of office.
By #this, the Group of the Popular Party European has commissioned a study that examine the possibilities to organise the promotion of the personnel and the assignment of tasks in our services, for the ends of our own administration.
Therefore, it is possible to continue the promotion of the products of quality without asking supplementary costs, and thus I ask to the Commission that do not detain the promotion of the products of quality, since after #this find  difficult regions, products of the earth and the entry of our familiar exploitations.
Now well, I manifest my total concordance with the speaker #Jean-#Louis *Bourlanges -to the that congratulate by the quality of his work- regarding the obligation that in the budget for the year 2000 attend  important needs recently arisen in the field of the category *IV, "external Actions", without putting in *entredicho #others previously formulated, as it pretends to take the Council.
In the Annual Report of the #ECB takes  an exhibition detailed so much of the preparatory work end made by the *SEBC in #day of the introduction of the only coin as of the main economic events and monetary occurred in the European Union in 1998 and in the first weeks of 1999.
It is a reason of special satisfaction for me that his President have gone back to highlight today that the Central Bank European also contemplates the protection of the consumer like an important task in the frame of the Monetary Union.
Now well, #if I know to read well the Treaty of the European Union, treats  of an essential element of the balance looked for by #that that have set up the Economic and Monetary Union, with the hit that know had account of the conditions of the step to the euro on 1 January of this year.
It knows *usted that this institution has shown with clarity the will to exert fully the competitions that *le awards the Treaty; it has biased  to hear to each #one of the members of his directory, gathers  with *usted regularly and takes of this appointment, in the day of today, the point *culminante of this performance.
Finally, I want to take advantage of the presence of the Commission in this debate to remember *algo that also has been repeated many times by this Parliament and that, anyway, is very important for our Group: the economic politics do not finishes  in the coin, do not finishes  in the monetary politics.
The other way around, it has worked well in #a lot of cases and agree in that it is necessary *presionar with the end that they establish  the formal democratic structures external and is in this point #where the so prompt -members of parliament as it have produced - will be the fundamental agents, also in the civil society.
We do not pretend the creation of a rigid system and the special character, the capacity to act and the identity of THROW like #such, are an all that consider important to avert that I THROW, in so much an organisation of aid humanitarian, involve  in the heavy machinery of taking of decisions of the Commission in general.
We expect with interest the creation of the organism that will have to elaborate the letter of rights fundamental and #would be suitable that was chaired by a representative of this Parliament and that present a document that confer direct rights to the citizens of the EU and *les allow, like individuals, exert his rights in the European Court.
It is necessary to take more *solidario the social model European, so that it was  in conditions to warn the marginalisation and to boost the independent establishment of the persons, #as well as to promote the equality of opportunities for #all the groups of citizens, also for the immigrants.
Without embargo, the Council do not has  brave to get to an agreement on the development of a common system European of asylum and of a bottom for the refugees, #such as they had proposed the European Parliament and the Commission and no *limitarnos simply to a convergence of norms and of procedures.
*Me Concerns that, simultaneously to the common norms, have not posed  effective measures of solidarity among the States members *cuando like this demand it the need to answer to situations of urgency, as in the case of the massive flow of #albanian citizens and of the *Balcanes to #Italia as a result of the political crisis of these countries.
In the first place, concerning the calendar, this reform -*permítanme, *Señorías, *expresarles my conviction- is the last occasion for a true reform before the big enlargement of the Union, before the meeting of the States and of the #european villages in a big political community and economic.
Proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on the leading protection against the *empotramiento of the vehicles of engine and by the that modifies  the Directive 70/156/*CEE of the Council (*COM(1999) 32 - *C4-0094/1999 - 1999/0007(*COD)) (Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market)
(The Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that amends  the Directive 92/61/*CEE of the relative Council to the reception of the vehicles of engine of two or three tyres (*COM(1999) 276 - *C5-0012/1999 - 1999/0117(*COD)) (Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market)
The contradiction results frankly ridiculous in the case of the #french Government, that *subscribió in the Treaty of *Amsterdam the financial and physical distribution of the refugees among the countries of the Union and now retreats in front of the consequences of his own signature.
Finally, taking loaned another time proposed and ideas of the report *Gillenhammer, have to say that I am had to send a letter to #all the companies with more of 1.000 persons, to #european level, *pidiéndoles that elaborate, voluntarily, a report titled "directing the change" to take a form of *benchmarking among the own great companies on how #can foresee the restructurings without creating great social problems and grave.
Finally, the #european socialists insist so that it review  the #european directive on the creation of a committee of company #european, so that it facilitate  an authentic information to the employees, in a normal and timely term, and celebrate  queries for real, it that supposes that they concede  half sufficient storms and means of *peritaje autonomous for the employees.
How felt has affirm that the benefits of *Michelin went up in a 17%, without saying #if they are greater or minors that the of *Bridgestone or of *Goodyear or of the other competitors, without saying that *Michelin is a company with a turnover of 106 dollars by worker, against the 141 of *Goodyear, without saying that *Renault that, #if no *me *equivoco is a company taken part mostly by the #french Government, goes to *Japón, buys the company *Nissan and, for no *cerrarla, sees  forced to sack to 21.000 workers that, without embargo, when being #japanese, *nos interest less.
It is to say, that the *margen was very reduced and, therefore, #can be useful -and without place to doubts will be useful- that our Parliament take to hear his voice after the of the Bosses of Government, that, in *Tampere, regretted the attitude of the #american Senate, when underlining that it constituted -quote- "an inopportune signal for those who seat the temptation to endow  of the nuclear weapon".
And in the Union, in #where #all have ratified the Treaty of prohibition of the nuclear proofs, have political arguments and morals for *dirigirnos to our American partners and *recordarles that have the grave responsibility to treat to stabilise the world and that have our help #if truly it #can  collaborate with *ellos.
A look that have to argue with *ellos, and that remains reflected in the article that quoted his *Señoría, gentleman *Elles, is that the unilateral character that today defend #some Republican, although no #all, to take justice to the Senator *Logan, corresponds to a politics of "only *nosotros" , for quoting the historical lemma Irish, and that #would result so disastrous for the world as it went it after the First World-wide War.
We need to boost there the values of the tolerance and of the respect to the cultural diversity and to the freedom of the villages to decide democratically his future and promote the coexistence, the solidarity, the sense of the justice and the peace.
*Me Take echo of the words of the Mr. *Gargani *cuando say that #all the subjects on the that have treated tonight in the Assembly try to guarantee that the culture was considered a priority; it is to say, no only, for example, that the euro or the places of work and the employment will guarantee the hit of the #european project.
The Commission is convinced that the participation of *Turquía in the programs allocated first of all to the youngsters, programs of exchange and meetings that strengthen the civil society, the democracy and the respect of the human rights, will favour the understanding and the understanding among the villages and the cultures.
And like this it suited , but here we are treating of another question, #this is, that presented  a proposal of resolution in the *cual appeared, in his last point, a question almost of courtesy, and is that it went  to remit the resolution to the president of this company, and it that happens is that the resolution of transaction that presented  carried this name.
Like this as, #if it approves  this commitment, will be necessary to vote the comment of the line *B1-4050, amends 507, with a favourable opinion of the Commission of Budgets and by means of vote by parts, requested by the Group of the Greens, #as well as the comment of the line *B1-406 on the amendment 69, this time by means of nominal vote.
In #such sense, *nosotros #can not accept the proposal of the Council to operate a reduction of the 10% of the credits assigned to the cooperation and to the development to fund the reconstruction of *Kosovo, #as well as the help to *Turquía, after the earthquake, or even the help to *Timor Oriental.
The worker is called, with the gun of the unemployment in the temple, to show  *solidario with the increase of benefits and accept agreements *humillantes regarding the terms, the conditions and the wages, as in the case of *MICHELIN, to finish losing definitively the place of work.
Lady Speaker, first of all, give the thanks to the Commissioner *Fischler by his intervention, and *le remember that the Wednesday of the next week expect that the President *Prodi or the Commissioner *Byrne avenge to the Parliament to take a statement about the measures that the Commission thinks to adopt after the publication of the scientific conclusions known to last hour of today.
I ask to the Commissioner *Fischler that, *cuando the School gather  next Wednesday, present immediately a proposal to create the European Alimentary Agency because, in my opinion, to having existed already this organism, the current discrepancy never #would have arisen.
We are #all of agreement in that the subjects of the alimentary security and the public health have to be the maximum political priority in #all *Europa, but the meat of bovine #british, #such as it has declared it today the Commissioner *Fischler, respects the goals of the public health established by the European Union.
It That, by the contrary, seems timely and desirable is that they take advantage of  these occasions to restart the work of organisation of the community Institutions, of the *cual this Parliament, in virtue of the mandate of #all the Europeans that represents, has to take load integrating the paper exerted up to now by the national Governments in the community construction.
No only we are determining and establishing his level of competition, but that, besides, *revestiría considerable importance determine clearly and signal the jurisdiction that the agency of security alimentary #would have in the community level and #which #would be his reciprocal effects with the agencies in the level of the States members.
Finally, it #would suit *usted *conmigo in that, although it existed -repeat, existed, in subjunctive- the agency that wishes to create the Mr. *Prodi and that still has not examined  thoroughly in this House, even in this case #can repeat #one and another time this same situation, as obviously they #would follow existing the national Agencies, that in any moment #can affirm that they have of new scientific data, so that his hope that said agency allow to avert situations like #this is a mere illusion?
Of course, have #a lot of taste in giving an explanation in relation with *eso, but have to remember to His *Señorías *algo that -am sure- know: they do not take  exports of meat of bovine elaborated with arrangement to the plan of export according to a calendar established from the Realm Joined, because in the first place it is necessary determine and approve some facilities for this end and the authorities of the Realm Joined no the have proposed.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, in name of the Liberal Group, support this initiative that consider very timely to ensure the necessary consensus in the economic and social field, absolutely indispensable to achieve the climate of stability, growth and greater occupation in the European Union.
It is essential that look for new and -better forms- with seen to the achievement of the goal of a development balanced and sustainable of #such mood that satisfy our needs and the of the environment and that do not have negative repercussions in the levels of life of the poor regions of the world.
It is to say, on the one hand, bankers, the Ministers of Economy and the associations of industrial, and by #another the Ministers of Work and the social speakers in the field of the unions, debate, and situate in the centre of the common politics the subject of the employment.
In spite of #everything, the sector of the transport in his whole, the maritime activities and the activities of the doctors in period of training remain excluded of the field of application of the relative directive to the ordination of the time of work of 1993.
Like speaker, have looked for a balance no only among the proposal of directive of the Commission, the first reading of the Parliament and the common position of the Council, but, especially, among the security and the health so much of the workers as of the remaining parts involved.
It treats , therefore, to limit the length of the time of work to protect the security and the health in the place of work, especially in the distinct sectors of the transport, the maritime activities and the doctors in period of training.
Regarding it that today has posed  with the amendment *nº 10, that is *algo that finishes to get to our hands, #would say that, by the first introduction that have of my collaborators, seems that the article 17, section 2 the include; But to be able to be clearer and treating of a first approximation, believe that for morning will be able to have a final answer on the subject of this amendment.
The agreement will allow to the two parts explode #all the potential linked with the capacities of investigation advanced of the countries in roads of durable development, as it has underlined , but also, as they #can appreciate His *Señorías, in the sphere of the concrete program "Energy-environment", in the sphere of the renewable energies, had account of the commitments of *Kyoto.
According to my experience, in the last five years, lamentably, the legislative norms on concrete looks of the only market always have debated  in this Assembly of way *fragmentaria, for saying it like this, without contemplating #all the links and interrelationships with other legislative subjects.
Of course, in our Group want that the attainment of the Inner Market comport a balance -as it has said *usted same, gentleman Commissioner- among the freedom of market and the need to protect the environment, the health and the confidence of the consumers.
Finally, from the point of sight of the active politics in matter of market of work, training and *recualificación, lines guidelines #all *ellas important, *me seems insufficient the level of convergence in reliable indicators of the efficiency of these politics inside the national plans of employment, in that the dimension of the community Institutions is anyway linked to controls of hit and of result.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, believe that it is intelligent and forced initiate this brief contribution to the debate on the guidelines of the employment *felicitándonos #all by the fine data that offers the #european reality and appreciating the work of #all the that have *empeñado it better of his intelligence in taking possible the that, at last, #can have a process of coordination in matter of employment, as it signals the article 128 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Now well, in relation with the of the report *Dimitrakopoulos, *Leinen, so that at least it #can have an intervention by group in a so important report, *yo #would propose that in this case suppressed  the turn of questions to the Council, with which #all the groups #can express, because it is a very important question for the Parliament.
The date of ends of the 2002 #would allow to the Commission take a total assessment of the effects of the new cycles of proofs type of approval, that will introduce  from the next year for the regulation of the broadcasts of particles *contaminantes of the new #european vehicles.
I want to manifest that the amendments numbers 3 and 5 go to be substituted by new amendments that modify the considering 18 and the articles 5, 6 and 7 to adapt the text that present to the editorial that has elaborated the Committee of Conciliation #Socrates and that goes to suppose a horizontal solution for the committees in the majority of the programs.
Without embargo, my Group has approved it with great objections and only because the Council has recognised and has used like foundation the definition of the World-wide Organisation. Of the Health , according to the *cual the concept of health has to be considered like a state of full corporal welfare, spiritual and social, and no only like the absence of illness and of weakness.
The Commission will study attentively the reports of this debate, and will undertake the necessary action to satisfy the worries of the Parliament, no only to celebrate the *décimo anniversary of the Convention but also to improve concrete politics, to end to fulfil with the goals established in this Convention.
It is of the opinion that the #finnish Presidency and, *eventualmente, the following, the #portuguese Presidency, have the worry that, for example, Big *Bretaña will happen  to the field enemy in the dispute on the rights of copartnership of the workers in the #european anonymous society?
But since there #be a delay, that already has regretted , expect that the time of this delay use  *constructivamente, and that the Council and the Commission, and also the Parliament, *reflexionen on the form to put the things it better possible in it that definitely is a key sphere.
This mood to proceed of the Council with the income of the European Union is not as very serious -it that formulate of a very soft mood- and, in front of the next process of enlargement, #can convert in an authentic mortgage that *nos prevent the possibilities of development.
On a long-term basis, it has to exist a direct relation among the finance of the costs of the Union and the citizens and to #that that now shout again gone up " of the taxes ", *les say incidentally that the charge of taxes and similar #can not increase in total for the citizens and citizens and that #this is the position that already adopt in March.
Besides, we are of the opinion, and *eso already had put it of self-evident with anteriority the Commission of Control Budgetary same, that it is necessary that believe  some reservations in the costs allocated to the European Bottom of Orientation and of Agricultural Guarantee, to be able to face up to the unforeseen costs.
Firstly, it is essential that the current disequilibriums of the budgetary participations because of the discounts that perhaps explain  historically dismantle  of gradual way, progressive, but *pertinaz and that the contributions of each country adapt  to his just measure from the point of sight objective and countable.
In the summit of the Council of *Berlín agreed  modifications for the part of the income in it *tocante to the maximum proportion of taxes on the value added that it delivers  to the Union, in it *tocante to the discount in the #british contribution and his finance and in it *tocante to the proportion of the *gravámenes agricultural and *aduaneros that the States members #can retain.
Gentleman President, believe that the report that are debating, with his proposals, #such as #this took form in the Commission of Budgets, contributes to the creation of a half balanced, austere and effective to reinforce the budgetary discipline that it is subject of #all and #whose application guarantees  only with the essential collaboration of the institutions and, of course, with the collaboration of the States members.
In it *tocante to the question of #if the costs that are foreseen in the frame of the enlargement for the agricultural sector will be sufficient, definitely will be necessary to observe continuously how evolves the situation in the States candidates to the adhesion and of how supposed has split  in *Berlín for the assessment of the necessary costs.
Without embargo, want to remember that the Parliament or the Union in general have developed during the years happened the procedure *Nootenbom until #such point that the transfers of credits to finals of year were almost impossible to see with clarity. Thus, we have insisted in this budget *rectificativo and supplementary to reach like this a greater transparency.
In addition to the report of the Mrs. *Dührkop, have heard before how have debated  the subjects of the own resources, of the budgetary discipline, and the truth is that it swims of #everything *ello *redundaría in benefit of the taxpayer #if we did not advance in the efficiency of the fight against the fraud.
They have exposed  three goals: first, promote the energetic efficiency; second, increase the participation in the production of the energetic sources less *contaminantes -the dip is the 12% of renewable in the year 2010-; third, reduce the environmental repercussions of the production and the utilisation of products energetic.
We have taken investments to increase the use of the sources of energy renewable and have declared our firm purpose to take into account the requirements of a stable energetic economy inside a process of enlargement.
The Commissioner *Byrne, declared it following in his appearance: the future of the politics in matter of public health do not have to circumscribe to the crisis of the moment, that has to have a high level of protection of the health in #all the community politics that we have to adopt a preventive attitude in matter of attention of public health.
I am safe that the Speaker will have to well write, in name of the European Union, to congratulate to #all the parts interested by his actions, his courage and his determination to carry out the process of peace and the disarmament and am safe that His *Señorías will suit *conmigo in that the peace in *Irlanda of the North *infunde hopes to #everyone and everywhere.
I will not mention the delivery *deshonrosa of an elderly of 90 years of part of Swiss to *Francia, since it treats  of a country that is not member of the European Union, but will mention simply the legislations increasingly *represivas that pretend to dictate the political and historical speech and of the that do not wish that they #can find favourable terrain to extend  of a #european State to #another.
By it that refers  to the proposal of directive, when reducing the terms of transmission of the judicial acts and *extrajudiciales of a Been member to #another are adopting an instrument that will allow that the judicial processes develop  in the best conditions of celerity and juridical security preserving the rights of #all the interested in the causes.
It do not aspires only to *subyugar to a proud village that insists in defining freely, *él only, the path of his country and the #his own, but that signals, of multiple ways, a self-evident intention of the imperialist Americans to impose his will, his law in the relations and economic and commercial activities international.
On purpose of #this, see by the communiqués of the agencies of #news of this afternoon that, after his mission, the World-wide Bank has reckoned that they will need  among 260 millions and 300 millions of dollars of the #EE.UU. For the reconstruction to half term in #that *Timor Oriental in ruins and that will procure that the majority of these bottoms the contribute donors in the conference that will celebrate  the next month in *Tokio.
The majority of the measures that appear in the annexes *II and *III are very effective to reduce the losses, for example, of resultant phosphorus of the agriculture and the future managerial-frame on the water the will complete with an instrument of plans of management in the level of the hydrographic basins.
Left lady Red, am totally of agreement and believe that the conclusions of the European Council of *Tampere underline the fact that there #be a horizontal approach among *pilares that cover the politics of immigration and asylum and the #others political of the European Union, inside the *cuales have the politics of help to the development.
These helps gave  with the condition that the companies had a commercial management -and therefore there was not a presence of the authorities of the countries or of the administrations of said countries-, that it carried out the suitable process of restructuring and that, at the end, obtained  some profitable companies and that they #can develop without need of new public helps.
In the frame of the chapter 24 of the negotiations of adhesion, that refers  to the cooperation in the fields of the justice and internal subjects, treated  on the controls in the external borders and the politics of visas of the EU.
I do not wish to repeat #all the points that so well has posed the High Representative, but had account that I have been invited to take part in this debate, it that *me full of satisfaction, wanted to say some words on the opinion of the Commission with regard to the creation of a politics of security and #european defence.
But the measures that #can adopt with the goal to warn the conflict and the human suffering include besides #many other things, like watching by the fulfillment of the law, the creation of institutions and the politics of trade.
And #if it remains another evident in the dictionary, is the following: while it follow being manager of the current competitions, neither a paper to smoke, or perhaps after the announcement that took yesterday #David *Byrne on the tobacco #would have to say any tissue of paper, will separate to the Commissioner of Relations External of the High Representative.
I understand that his opinion is that yes and, in this case: How opinion *le deserves the decision of the Council of Ministers that, in the first reading of the budget of the year that comes, has reduced the amounts to an inferior level to the of the amounts of the year 1996?
*Usted Has referred  to the reallocation of the resources and to the possibility to have appropriate means Agrees *conmigo in that, in this moment, the reallocation of the resources inside the European Union is much more important that pose the increase of the maximum limits of defence?
From 1990, since it came  down the clash among blocks, has gone back to be possible to rid conventional regional wars in *Europa, that open again the doors to the ancient traditional clashes among ethnic groups, to the disputes by the outline of the borders, etc., and to the resumption of the ancient cycle of the violence.
Along #all the Round of the #Millenium #would have to can formulate specific recommendations -of compliance with the section 5 of the article 97 of the Regulation of the European Parliament- that *nos allow to influence on the works before the conclusion of the new Agreement, follow his development and leave feel properly the weight of our opinions.
The seven fundamental norms develop the four human rights basic in the work: the right to the freedom of organisation and of meeting without fetters, the right of syndication, the right to not making works *forzosos, the right to enjoy of the childhood.
I have enumerated only #some of the essential looks, #whose importance also have signalled in repeated occasions #others and other colleagues, because #any of *nosotros will tire  to insist in the need that the subjects related with the environment and the protection of the consumers debate  in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
Another element reinforces also the powers awarded to the Commission in the frame of the proposal in study: the possibility to reduce the amount of the direct helps or to suspend the payment of the monthly advances.
They have forced to the Department of State to trace a strategic map of the possible routes: the most important #would be the route among the sea *Caspio and the #turkish port of *Ceyahn that affects to the axis among *Baku and the #russian port of *Novorossijsk.
Although we know that #this will hamper enormously for the European Union the conversations and negotiations on the *incumplimiento of the commercial agreement and of the agreement on the steel by part of the Russians. The terrorism #can not  and do not has to  combat by means of the employment of the military strength against #all a village.
Finally, keep the principle of the cultural exception, that recognises the possibility for the Union and the States members to preserve his capacity to define with freedom his audiovisual cultural politics in name of the development of an alive diversity and *enriquecedora.
We expect, finally, that the European Parliament #can exert an active paper in the Round of the #Millenium beginning by the previous knowledge of the study of the Commission on the hypotheses of impact of the effects of the new normative process.
And so that this free trade was a free just trade, is evident that have to conciliate the commercial norms with the norms that refer  to the protection of the environment, the rights of the workers, the agricultural model European or the protection of the consumers.
But I believe that #if we work joined of an open way with the common goal to improve the quality of life of #everyone, will be able to really confuse to the critics of the globalisation and show that the globalisation and the liberalisation #can be an authentic decisive strength for the sake.
In addition to strengthening in our own continent the legitimacy of the performance of the Union, the participation of the global group of the no governmental organisations- #can help to our negotiators to achieve the goals of the Union.
#That to those who concern the human rights, the protection of the animals and the environment have some a lot better perspectives to guarantee improvements in said fields inside a juridical frame and in a World-wide Organisation of the Trade, that in #one *gresca or law of the jungle.
Gentleman President, in any case and to #all the effects, take to state that I have presented this appeal three hours ago, with my signature and the of the president of the Liberal Group and with the agreement of the President of the Group of the *PPE, although it have not signed.
And #this supposes, among other things, that the goal of the new Conference *Intergubernamental has to be the improvement of the previous institutions to the reception of the new members, the improvement of the mood of operation of the institutions and of the #european politics.
Therefore, that first small reform, in the that only was necessary to talk of the Commission and of the weighting of the votes in the Council and to the that the Statement of Colony had added also the possible extension to qualified majority, do not has too much sense, answers to a distinct political logic.
*Nosotros, the Group of the Popular Party European and the European Democrats, #can and want to collaborate in this direction #if the problems of the Report *Napolitano resolve  of a reasonable form, and the problems are in the limit of it that *nosotros #can support with our vote, #if well we are not in mood #any truly satisfied.
We expect that the Parliament brake once again this frontal attack to the Convention of the Nations Joined on the refugees, to the Statement of Rights of the Boy and to the juridical security of the citizens of third countries that find  inside the borders of the Union.
*Cuando Convert the Agreement and the Protocol *EURODAC in a community Regulation, modify it so that it was in total consonance with the community legislation on the protection of data, included the new Article 286 of the Treaty, that fixes the disposals of protection of data for the community institutions.
The two questions that more seem to have concerned to the Parliament are the question of the minimum age for the taking of prints digital and the norms for the destruction of the data saved in the central base of data.
#If we had to destroy #all the data on the applicants of asylum in what the interested #can benefit of any class of condition juridical, the Regulation *EURODAC #would not apply  already to the situations in the that an applicant of asylum receives permission to remain in any #another quality during a brief space of time and, at the end of this period, goes to another Been member and requests asylum in *él.
The debate of today #can, nevertheless, contribute to a better knowledge by part of the House of the increasing threat that constitute the drugs, on the real and no imaginary database, and *coadyuvar to the achievement of improvements to short and long term of the critical current situation.
Without more preambles, gentleman President, declare that we agree, that approve the plan of the Commission; have, without embargo, reservations that formulate; reservations, that shares the own Commission, owed to the non-existent evaluation of the programs and to the insufficient general approach in relation with the existent real threat. During the last fifteen years, gentleman President, the drugs do not constitute simply a threat.
After the European Council of *Tampere it will be necessary to give priority to the prevention of the juvenile delinquency, urban and related with the drug, and to the gradual harmonisation of the legislation of the European Union on the traffic of drugs illicit.
Second, the *ORD (Organ of Solution of Differences), created in the breast of the *OMC, has demanded of the European Union that renounced to his own norms in fields so fundamental like the sanitary and alimentary security or even to his politics of cooperation in the question of the banana of the countries *ACP and of the regions *ultraperiféricas.
It is necessary to go back to examine the situation of disequilibrium that gives off of the fact that only the commercial agreements *multilaterales have ended in the creation of an organism of nature judicial, *cuando *ello has not been like this neither with regard to the agreements on the environment neither to the of the *OIT.
This doubt refers  to our capacity -and to our real will- to convert to the *OMC in an instrument of regulation, with the end to happen of a globalisation wished by #one #few and suffered by #all to a world-wide trade truly *reglamentado, that benefit to the group of the planet.
With the argument that it is necessary to simplify the application of the Agreement of *Dublín, the Council pretends to repeat previous attempts of *cercenar fundamental rights of the citizens of third countries by means of the creation of a mechanism of collected of digital prints controlled by a central unit, that cover no only to the refugees and applicants of asylum, but also to #all the citizens of third countries that find  in irregular situation.
*Nosotros Support these efforts of *saneamiento, contributing in the activities of two scientific centres and international technicians, the of *Moscú and the of *Kiev, and, #if it was necessary, are had to provide a supplementary help to these programs, very understood that, as *ustedes have said it during the debate, are now very near of the step to the year 2000 and that it essential has been to begin to concern  thus opportunely.
#If they do not have future, or better said, do not have a #worthy future, since "they are enclosed among the #albanian terror in *Kosovo and the repulsion and the discrimination of other countries, with the aggravating that the humanitarian help in the central part of the *Balcanes is getting to his end".
Equally, we agree a plenary and total support to the efforts carried out by the *MINUK, to create an operational civil administration, in conditions to assume the functions of police that at present are in hands of *KFOR and to create a society *multiétnica peaceful, able to take  charge of the reconstruction of *Kosovo and of the *restablecimiento of his society.
In accordance with previous statements, the European Commission has left very seated that any new judicial formality related with the contribution taken by the Mr. *Nikitin to the Report *Bellona has to be in full compliance with the principles and the norms of acceptance international in matter of justice and human rights.
The fact to say that it is intolerable that there are boys forced to work in place to go to the school, that #can not eat it sufficient, that the boys are sold like commodities, that are victims of physical violence or morals by part of the adults, is already a big step that, of course, has to translate in our political acts and in our daily life!
By #everything it aforesaid, estimate that this initiative is a step in the fine direction, with the utilisation of the modern technology of digitalisation of images with computer to help to the organisms commissioned to take fulfil the law and to the ministries of the interior to cooperate in #all the Union.
The debate *nos teaches that all it that collects  in our approach no *fructifica because the conjoint work of the governments do not suffices to take a new legislation in matter of structures of security on the base of the problems that poses the inner market and the speed of integration that #this involves.
*Yo #Would wish that this principle of opening that has produced  in the relations with the Bank follow advance and that at the end #can get to a result that was satisfactory for the Parliament and for the European Bank of Investments, without forgetting, as it said previously, that the *BEI is a financial institution that it #can give information without any restriction of subjects of #any nature.
Without embargo, as *sucede in #many other areas, the reasons that the agreements have been awarded to countries like *Corea are surely the conditions that in *ellos exist: for example, the workers of these countries receive wages very low, have labour conditions and measures of security very deficient and unsatisfactory due to the fact that the health and the security of the workers are not a priority.
Without embargo, seems that now the civil servants of the the General Direction of Competition of the Commission have the firm purpose to interpret the program in question like help to the dockyards, although the program do not affects to the competitiveness of #the same, since the ship that benefit  of the help will be able to commission in any country.
To finish, wish *preguntarle to the gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, how #can be possible for a Been member trace a politics of navigation, #if it #can not  entrust in the instructions given by the Commission  How the Commission in his recent correspondence with the governmental authorities has considered the Records of adhesion of *Finlandia with regard to the mentioned political?.
Lady *Doyle, *le appreciate his intervention and have to *decirle that *me have allowed *adelantarme to the wish of His *Señoría and, in name of the European Parliament, already have written to #all the bosses of the main parties *norirlandeses bear *comunicarles the admiration that feel by it that have reached and *enviarles our best wishes, the more *calurosos, for the continuation with hit of the process of peace.
Without our recognition, #some of these countries #can demoralise and *volvernos the back: his economies #would begin to diverge and the advances to the democracy and the respect of the human rights #would run the risk to detain  and #would lose  maybe for ever a big historical occasion.
Without embargo, declare with #the same firmness that #if it exists the risk that the enlargement conduct to the dissolution or #one *desvirtuación of the European Union, in the sense that we finish being only an economic and financial administration, but no a political Union, #if the enlargement comported this risk, then #would have to *rechazarla.
Gentleman President, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, expect that the Speaker in exercise of the Council have time to read, before the summit, our resolution on #the same and also the report that approve on the Conference *Intergubernamental the month of November, because I have thrown in fault a bit the reflection on #some of the arguments that bear *nosotros are absolutely keys.
The Council  *apresta to exclude - like this believe it - of shameful way to the European Parliament of the Conference *Intergubernamental and, especially, has  to ensure that the Conference occupy  only of three points of functional improvement of the Institutions and, therefore, to leave of the all *inalterado this incomprehensible castle of *naipes that they are the Treaties of the Union.
Finally, I want *expresarle to the Mrs. Speaker in exercise of the Council my sincerer congratulations because it has achieved, without need to modify the rule, thing that had not achieved  still, increase clearly the transparency in the European Union and, in particular, in the process of taking of decisions of the Council.
Likewise, in front of the multiplication of the systems of signing (*Europol, *Eurodac), the European Parliament #would have to have reiterated his request that it saw the light an independent commission on computing and freedoms to end to preserve our individual freedoms, in addition to the democratic control and *jurisdiccional.
Of the subjects that *nos has exposed the Presidency in exercise of the Council, the subject of the design in the new frame of the enlargement do not poses problems neither to this Parliament neither to the proposal of the Commission, neither neither to the Council of ministers.
Said communication, that the Commission foresees to adopt in the *primer semester of the 2000, will complete the report of the Council on the human rights, since it will occupy  especially of the concrete actions that it #can undertake the Community to promote the respect of the human rights in third countries, so as to back our statements and *darles consistency by means of serious and concrete initiatives.
(To5-0070/1999) of the Mr. *Morillon, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the relative Council to the realisation of actions directed to deepen the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía (*COM(1998) 600 -*C4-0669/1998 - 1998/0299(*CNS)).
Without embargo, the Commission of Environment do not agrees with the intention of the Commission to concede in some mood a cheque in white that allows exceptions without limit. In effect, the proposal foresees that the countries that have it that designates  like socioeconomic problems #can request a transitory period of five years, that to continuation #can *prorrogarse other five years more.
*Yo Believe that #if we achieve it and the Commission, as I expect, also #can take #his the proposals of our commission, will have marked truly a milestone in the improvement of the quality of the air acclimatise and also will have contributed a lot to leave clear that to the substances *carcinógenas no  *les has lost at all in the environment.
The proposal taken by the European Commission, reinforced by the report of the Mrs. *Breyer, that goes more far, poses the principle of the evaluation and the management of the quality of the air acclimatise by it that refers  to two sources *contaminantes important -the *benceno and the monoxide of carbon- produced the two by the circulation by road.
The Commission #can accept the amendment 15 in part and considers that this proposal #would have to adjust to the Directive 1999/30 inserting the words "in those cases in that it exist more of a season of measurement in the zone or in the urban core, at least #one has to be situated wall of the traffic and at least #another has to be oriented to the urban bottom" .
The proposal of the Commission contemplated a calendar of execution too much fast, and, by this reason, has  *prorrogado the entrance in vigour of the directive until the year 2003, date in that the States members will have been able to adapt his legislations to the requirements of this directive.
In any case, neither the Commission of Agriculture neither this Parliament pretend that no  *le facilitate to *Portugal this supplementary quota so that it go adapting and taking increasingly competitive in his production of tomato, but yes #would be an important occasion to happen of the system of quotas to the of thresholds by countries.
Today it wanted to accompany my intervention with a pair of considerations that, to my seem, do not refer  to an exclusively technical question, but that also represent a fundamental approach, as I think that also in the field of the agricultural politics #would have to reason in terms much more global, already from his approach.
It is well that in the monetary dialogue of the European Parliament with the Central Bank European take  patent, take  transparent #one and another time, *cuán important is the stability of the prices for this independent monetary authority, and that, thus, #this concern  that this goal impose  keeping the vicinity to the citizen.
Therefore, the community preference constitutes for the socialists our commitment with the sector of the community fishing, with our persons, with the fishermen, the workers of the industry *pesquera and the *armadores, that expect can keep his activity and his places of work.
Report (To5-0070/1999) of the Mr. *Morillon, in name of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, on the proposal of regulation of the relative Council to the realisation of actions directed to deepen the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía (*COM(98) 600 - *C4-0669/98 - 1998/0299(*CNS))
Far to identify  with the *adalides of his own countries in the planetary economic war, #one and #others *fustigaban together the capitalism of the multinationals, the profitability to *ultranza, the *mercantilización of the nature until the patented of the living beings, the *nivelación of the cultures, the *ahondamiento of the inequalities practically everywhere and, in particular, among the North and the South.
Gentleman Commissioner, *Seattle do not has *fracasado neither by it unsuitable of the Common Organisation of Markets neither by the electoral campaign of the States Joined that it also has contributed to the failure: *Seattle has *fracasado because the political will of the most important countries was to brake the international trade, in place to accelerate it.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, believe that *Europa with his secular tradition of the economy of market, of the free trade and of the economic freedom -that it is freedom without adjectives- has to affirm that the goal of the integration of the markets and of the freedom of trade is a goal of by himself/hisself that it has to conquer for *nosotros and for #all the other countries.
Gentleman President, the negotiations of *Seattle allowed to put of relief some political opening to #some of the positions of the European Union on the agricultural file, as in the case of the environmental worries, the *inocuidad of the foods or the development of the rural communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0092/1999) of the Mr. *Busk, in name of the Commission of Fishing, on the proposal of Regulation (*CE) of the Council by the that they establish  measured of applicable control in the zone of the Agreement on the future cooperation *multilateral in the *caladeros of the Atlantic northeastern (*COM(1999) 345 - *C5-0201/1999 - 1999/0138(*CNS)).
It is an important directive, in the first place, because -as it has said the speaker- is #one of these cases of tarpaulin full of set up of the possibilities that awarded the ancient article 138 *B of the Treaty of *Maastricht, is to say: that this Parliament launch an initiative that was restarted by the Commission and followed by the Council.
Besides, the calculations on the assessment of the needs of the permission of traffic, base  in the current traffic by the *Alpes, mainly by *Austria, without taking into account that this traffic is regulated by the limiting system of *ecopuntos, in the that they have reckoned  other quantitative analogies for the States members.
#Many of the amendments go directed to shorten the terms for the elimination by stages of the *hidroclorofluorocarburos and the bromide of methyl, goal that certainly shares the Commission to the light of his important and increasing contribution to the fight against the exhaustion of the coat of ozone.
With #everything, *me is *grato *anunciarles that the efforts of the Commission to guarantee that the European Parliament #can exert the paper that *le corresponds in the Conference *Intergubernamental have been *recompensados: the Parliament will have a statute of observer of right plenary in the group of the personal representatives.
In the Letter includes  the proposal of the European Union on a model of cooperation among the international organisations, designated platform, that #would apply , especially, in the prevention and management of crisis, and that #would reinforce the capacity of the Organisation to act with rapidity in the no military management of crisis.
Without embargo, *me had seemed more careful that, even treating of a Summit devoted to the enlargement, had situated  in a *primer plane the group of subjects relative to the Conference *Intergubernamental, highlighting in this way that neither the most modest enlargement will be able to work #if before they do not resolve  the pending questions and the institutional subjects.
Already we have achieved to open a bit the door, but, frankly, have to signal that the Summit of *Helsinki has not adopted the recommendations made by the Committee of Experts, chaired by the Mr. *Dehaene and based in the excellent proposals that prepared the European Commission under the direction of the Commissioner *Barnier.
There are #some progresses and the #can analyse with serenity: two representatives of the European Parliament will take part in #all the sessions of negotiation and will be able to take part to the principle of each meeting of the Conference *Intergubernamental; likewise, in each meeting of this type will have conversations among the President of the Parliament and the bosses of State and of Government.
It That pretend is that, with this program, in the next five years the global quota of the audiovisual products of #european origin increase to a large extent by means of a politics of support to the creation, the production and the diffusion of products audiovisual *auténticamente #european.
Subject: Letter of the fundamental rights of the EU From the point of sight of the Commission, #would have to be *vinculante to juridical effects the Letter of the fundamental rights of the EU that is drafting  under the mandate of the Summit of *Tampere #would have to be *vinculante to juridical effects?
The Commission initiated a series of actions special to support to the national authorities participants in the fight against the illicit nuclear traffic pertinent so much of the States members of the EU as of the States candidates, included seminars, programs of training and technical assistance.
I understand the constitutional arguments, the political arguments, but try *explicarlos to somebody that *carece of a ceiling on his head in *Kosovo, try *explicarlos to a pensioner that wants to receive the social subsidy in *Montenegro, try *explicarlos to somebody of the *ARYM that think that the difficult measures that have adopted  in this country in the last years deserve quite more support of the European Union.
*Nosotros Follow keeping the offer that already made the Parliament, with #a #symbiosis of discipline budgetary, on the one hand, and by the #another side, the will to consider cuts very concrete and no linear, as they pretended *ustedes, and to contemplate to #the same time the necessary political priorities and *financiarlas.
On the other hand, the President of the Court of Accounts has devoted yesterday, in this enclosure, «the persistence of the culture of the costs in the breast of the Community, that is more concerned by the volume of the costs that by his quality».
Gentleman President, with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam have increased considerably the attributions of the European Parliament, that has assumed new powers of *codecisión in the sphere of the prevention and the fight against the harmful frauds for the financial interests of the Community.
Therefore, already it is hour to finish with tight compartments among the Common Agricultural Politics, the structural Bottoms, the own resources of the Community and his internal and external politics and ensure that it exists an alone weight and an alone measure for #all *ellos.
The decision to carry out visible actions satisfies the condition of *evidenciar the positive paper of the European Union regarding the demolitions that ten years ago left after himself/hisself the communism and puts to proof the goodness of the western democratic system in front of the *fracasado *dirigismo previous.
Second, also *me has concerned that, in reality, the Commissioner do not propose to give #a lot of support to the *ONG, and #this is, exactly, it that says #a lot of persons that works in favourable projects to the democracy: that go to stop to the section of the budget that refers  to the democracy and to the human rights, in place to achieve greater efficiency inside other projects.
Gentleman President, the present recommendation invites to the Parliament to issue his *dictamen satisfied on the proposal of the relative Council to the technical harmonisation in the sector of the car *considerándola an important factor for the development of the world-wide market.
I do not know #if it treated  of a diabolical attempt of my #italian friend Mr. *Dell' #Alba so that we abandon *Estrasburgo, #if they were my Conservative colleagues of the Realm Joined that *equivocaron the day of the visit of the President *Chirac or #if it treated  of a gift *navideño of *chocolatinas #belgian that now will be hit to the walls of the playground.
Besides, I create -and it *deploro- that there #be a big absent in this resolution: they are the citizens, since we do not have to forget that further of the measures that #can take the States of the Union, are the citizens, the consumers, those who, through his habits, of his behaviours, will induce the change and will impose it to the managers.
It #would wish that our Parliament expressed again his reservations express regarding the system of the rights of pollution, the mechanism of flexibility, since, #if well we want to resolve the enormous problem of the effect *invernadero, #can not accept this process in that all #can buy or sell and in that they #can buy  the rights of pollution.
The abandonment of the nuclear energy #can be the subject of conversation of the populist in the countries developed of *Europa and in this Parliament, of the populist to *ultranza. It do not exists realistic alternative in any place, not even in the countries to the that the Union will expand  in the future.
Gentleman President, the Popular Party European has affirmed repeated times that considered fundamental the adoption by part of the Council and of the Commission of a public position before the day 20 December, date in that it will produce  the transmission of sovereignty of the territory of *Macao to the Popular Republic of Chinese.
The conjoint statement *luso-#chinese -to the that already has referred  here the Commissioner *Patten- is a fine statement and in *ella appear, in group, the great lines that #can orient the territory of *Macao in the next 50 years like specific zone, with his own specificity inside the #chinese whole, is to say, respecting #all the legislation that applied the #portuguese in *Macao.
- Report (To5-0091/1999) of the Mr. *Chichester, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies  the Directive of the Council 80/181/*CEE relative to the approximation of the legislations of the States members on units of measure (*COM(1999) 40 - *C4-0076/1999 - 1999/0014(*COD))
Report (To5-0075/1999) of the Mr. #Aparicio *Sánchez, in name of the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism, on the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (*CE) by the that it establishes  the distribution of permissions for the vehicles of transport heavy of commodities that circulate by Swiss (*COM(1999)35 - *C5-0054/1999 - 1999/0022(*COD))
In other words, #if the enlargement works, #if the program of the Diary 2000 reaches to improve the economic situation of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental, *ello will reduce by himself/hisself same the flow of refugees economic pertinent of said countries to the current States members of the European Union.
Probably, it #would fit to indicate still on this subject that #one of the important previous conditions to approve the finance of #all the projects reviewed and elaborated by the European Bank of Investments is that it take  in account the point of sight ecological, and like this took  in the case of the project *Gardaland.
It is conscious the Council that this problem affects to the information that facilitates  in the press on the results of the sessions *plenarias of the Parliament, since the journalists only #can be in a spot to #the same time (and usually gives  priority to the meetings of the Council in *Bruselas?
The #finnish Presidency demanded to the international community in the session of the 54 General Assembly of the UN that find the solutions and the timely answers to confront the new and unpredictable challenges in the frame of the humanitarian Right.
Gentleman President, the prevention and the fight against the illegal traffic of appropriate materials for the construction of arms atomic, bacteriological and chemical is the goal of the cooperation among the authorities *aduaneras, judicial and police in the frame of the cooperation of the Union in matter of delinquency, goal that tries to reach directly or well through *EUROPOL.
From this point of sight want to signal that it takes #some days, *cuando in *Helsinki adopted  the political decision to expand the European Union, with #all correction fixed  the political criteria of the *Europa of the fifteen, the criteria of *Copenhague, but it is necessary to consider that the new countries candidates to the adhesion have problems that up to now the fifteen did not have.
So that the citizens have the possibility to control that the application of law by part of the Court of Justice fulfils the criteria of independence and objectivity, traditionally inherent to the judicial system, #would be necessary that the application of the law occurred with transparency.
#All the that was present in the different commissions during the previous deliberation of the reports *Von *Wogau, *Rapkay, *Jonckheer and *Langen knows until how point the politics of competition and the future of the politics of the inner market *inciden in the future development of the economy, the growth and the employment of *Europa.
Gentleman President, receive with *beneplácito this opportunity to take a brief contribution to this debate and begin with the observation that a prompt and satisfactory solution of the controversy on the *inocuidad of the foods *reviste paramount importance for the consumers, for our graziers and, in fact, for the alimentary industry.
The Commission #can not accept the amendment proposed to suppress the requirement of a real debate among the Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the main proposal based in the article 152 of the Treaty.
Therefore, in the Record and in the Literal Record of the session, so much on purpose of the intervention on *Macao as in the Literal Record, on purpose of the interpellation to the Table with occasion of the resolution on *Chechenia, *yo appear identified like #Luís *Queiró, my colleague that seats  in the seat 571, and no with my own name, *Ribeiro and *Castro, that *me seat in the seat 662.
In my opinion the *primer point is that it underline  the importance of the trade of the skilled book, that bet by the quality and no by the quantity, that need the skilled advice and a special offer of the scientific and skilled bibliography, #as well as a service and attention *individualizados.
#If in the section 4º of the resolution includes  that it will displace  a delegation to *Kuwait, also will have to treat the problematic of the local Administration, #as well as the question of the procedure, because it results extraordinarily clumsy that a proposition of law of #this *envergadura #can not approve by a fault of procedure.
The Bottom created  to promote the urban and rural development, the development of the communities, to increase the qualities and to improve the quality of the environment; the justifications quoted in the amendments of the Greens are false.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0083/1999) of the Mr. *Xaver *Mayer, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal of regulation (*CE) of the Council that modifies the Regulation (*CEE) 1696/71 by the that it establishes  the common organisation of markets in the sector of the *lúpulo (*COM(1999) 302  *C­0081/1999  1999/0128(*CNS))
In my opinion this space constitutes the *Balcanes of the future, #one *Balcanes to scale world-wide. And by #such reason is of vital interest for *nosotros, so much more what that there has seat a series of powers nuclear, stabilise that space and prevent that the ethnic conflicts of there have effects especially the world.
Anyway I wish to reassure to #all the honourable deputies, to the equal that have taken it with the countries candidates, with the certainty that on our part the, *llamémosla, institutional crisis to the that *nos confront in this moment and that of course *repercute also in some sense in the work of the Commission, did not has to carry and will not carry to delays in the process of the enlargement.
It wanted to conclude saying, also to the own countries candidates to the integration, that has been and follow being, also today, our philosophy that has to value each country candidate by his own merits and by his own progresses, although #this #can conduct to some differentiation, at the same time that it is especially important that leave clear that, while #some in a moment determined #can have advanced more that #others, #all the family of the enlargement will follow being an alone family.
Regarding the posture of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics ascertain that in bold strokes it shares the opinion of the Commission *cuando #this affirms that the modifications proposed will allow that in the future the politics in matter of competition will adjust  more to the economic reality.
As #this is probably my last speech in front of the European Parliament gathered in session *plenaria, wanted to give thanks to #all the persons with the that have worked during the 15 years that have formed part of the European Parliament and, in particular, to the fine citizens of the *Greater *Manchester Central, to the that have had the honour to represent from 1984 in the frame of the system of *circunscripciones individual.
The Commission shares likewise the importance that his speaker and #the same Defender of the Village attribute to the strengthening of the confidence of the citizens in the #european Institutions, in particular *cuando the citizens report situations that do not consider satisfied to the #european disposals.
*Cuando Directs a claim to the European Parliament, the citizen no only reports *algo that to his trial constitutes a bad application of the community legislation, but that to #the same time expresses his confidence in the Parliament and the other Institutions expecting that #this repair the injustice.
Regarding the first sentence of the text, taking into account the diversity of the subjects to argue in the field of «Customs 2000», the Commission prefers to leave to the States members the possibility to take part with more of a representative, so as to be able to debate specific arguments.
It treats  of a complex question, especially *cuando treats  of the question of the rates for the use of roads, but the deputies do not have to forget that #a lot of States members possess already plans to fix a price to the utilisation of the roads and that other countries expect *introducirlos.
Step now to our second argue. Also we refuse the concept of the Commission because it advocates consciously a preparation and an application in three stages, which comes to say that the distortions of the competition among the moods of transport and the companies of the different States members keep  in foot.
The NATO #can not be at the same time leading in a conflict and, according to the diary *Le *Monde , speaker of the *UCK, that *le provides information on the #serbian positions that they have to be destroyed; it #can not be a new police strength international that fulfils with a duty of interference and at the same time a humanitarian organism...
And it is *irrisorio that the proposal of resolution ask (in the section 3) the application of the decisions of the Nations Joined or that applaud (section 4) the «initiative» of the General Secretary of the UN, Mr. *Annan, without mentioning, although it was in two words, his content!
In this frame, results particularly *chocante that, by this reason, do not apply  the tolls in the metropolitan zones, in the that live the persons with greater incomes and #where #would suit *desincentivar the utilisation of vehicles private, and keep  in zones more disadvantaged in the that, by not having popular demonstrations neither electoral costs, increase  #all the years.
From a point of sight formal, #this is a correct attitude. After all, the Commission had not presented officially new proposals or proposals modified from the rejection of the proposal of the Commission by the European Parliament.
It wanted to also congratulate to the speaker, Mrs. *Thors, by his report and *congratularme that the Commission of Subjects Juridical have integrated practically #all our proposals, the proposals of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary, in his report.
To the *respecto, the speaker suggests to examine the favourable looks to the institution of a *Ombudsman , or Defender, of the European Union for the financial services; *yo #would propose to go even more far and examine more amply the measures of claim that they have at present the users of services financial in #all the Union.
The rhythm of the changes in the markets and in the financial intermediations has put of self-evident the possible limits of a sectorial approach and this phenomenon increases with the process of integration financial global.
I want to underline that, among other things, in the text asks  to the Commission that elaborate a #european rule, for the time being, lamentably non-existent, that guarantee elevated standard of security in the tunnels of roads and rail, and to the Council that adopt without more delay the proposal of directive on the controls of the commercial vehicles.
The Commission has promoted a relative wide legislation to the norms for vehicles, of the that also form splits minimum norms on the *inflamabilidad of the vehicles of engine, like part of his legislative program for the homologation EU of the vehicles of engine.
We take really a call to the European Commission so that *presione to Indonesian to end to achieve that it improve the situation, and *presionamos especially to the European Commission so that also it concern  by that the elections develop  well and by that, in these elections, concede  rights to the minoritary groups of the smallest islands.
Gentleman President, the previous orators already have taken upsetting in the intolerable attitude of the Government of *Birmania, that denied  to concede a visa of entrance to the Dr. #Michael *Aris just before his demise. Also they have referred  painstakingly to the support that receives this frightful diet by part of Chinese.
Gentleman President, there #be not any difference of opinion among the Commission and this House on the continuous and grave rapes of human rights occurred in *Birmania. The next 26 April will appear this country again in the agenda of the Council of Subjects General.
On the other hand, to the speaker no  *le #can deny the merit to having insisted in that the measures proposed #can not give place to a *encarecimiento of the transport. It adds that in case that the result was sure enough an increase of *losimpuestos, it #would be necessary to diminish in another place the charge for the users of the transport.
*Nosotros That we are the managers of his education and that, like politicians, #would have to be the most faithful interpreters of the needs of the citizens, have the obligation to report the origins of this violence and define the methods of fight more effective.
(OF ) Gentleman President, *me direct to *ustedes from my special situation, as I am the only deputy of this Assembly that came to the world before the *I World-wide War, that besides was chosen for this Parliament *cuando already had surpassed amply the age of retirement and that afterwards has enjoyed of 20 years of life and parliamentary work.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the oral question (*B4-0155/99) of the Gentlemen *Colino *Salamanca and *Garot, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the supply in vegetal proteins and the situation in the industry of the starch.
In this sense, the European Commission has elaborated proposals of action extremely positive that pretend to boost the sustainable urban development in the European Union. Like this, they foresee  fiscal incentives for the restoration of houses and obviously contemplate  special conditions for zones *extremamente sensitive, as it is the case of #Venecia.
It is the *noveno report of this term of office but no *le go to bore with #all the statistics; it regrettable is that it is not a very pleasant question really and here do not treats  of a legislation or the promotion of the #european integration, but of a subject of immunity parliamentary.
Gentleman President, the problem that *nos takes to see the suspension of the immunities that today we treat is not neither more neither less that a part of a general problem. This general problem is that this Assembly do not explains still with an only statute for his deputies.
Another problem that arose was the that in that moment probably there was not neither a majority in the Assembly to concede the approval of the management neither an absolute majority for *denegarla, by it that the Parliament was prisoner among these two requirements of different majorities of his Regulation.
Obviously, the pact for the stability was celebrated by *nosotros, but no  *nos satisfies to #all *nosotros with a politics of stability that *estrangula the public budgets and that *les deprives of #all political space of manoeuvre and also of the need to create conditions mark in the education, in the investigation and in the professional training.
I will finish with the subject of the set up of the *GOPE saying that the Commission expects *encarecidamente that, to the contrary of it that occurred the past year, the States members #can, along this *primer year of the euro, put of agreement on a content *prescriptivo precise, operative and no *edulcorado of the great orientations of the economic politics, especially regarding the recommendations by countries and to the politics of employment.
Maybe the fundamental characteristic went the deficiencies of the structure of management, that remains very clear in the paragraph 19 of the document attach, in the that it says : «The deficiencies in the structure of management *propiciaron operative distortions in the application of the politics». #Who knows?
Second, as it already has said the Mr. *Elles, gives an indication to the new Parliament -#if well never have to pretend reign after dying and, of course, no a speaker that goes to abandon the Parliament- on the type of questions that #can use  to judge to the new Commission during the appearances.
Gentleman President, wanted colleagues, with the examination of the report of our colleague *Brinkhorst on the postponement of the approval of the management for the exercise of 1997, our intention is not *hurgar in the grave wounds that have devastated to the Commission these last years *forzándola to resign.
I fear that his interpretation in contrary sense had a *tufillo of electoral campaign in place of the exercise of the pure reason, because it that have said has been very simple: while it exist the prohibition, #can not have risk for the health, because the meat with hormones is not allowed in the European Union.
#This allows to the States members orient his experiments to those sectors of the #can expect the maximum benefit, #if the experiment is wider, more data go to have with hindsight and greater goes to be the possibility to get to some definite measures very founded that they conduct to the creation of more stable employment and *eso was precisely of it that treated .
The recent experiences indicate that, in any case, #would suit to examine the possibility of the individual cessation, already was by initiative of the President of the Commission, of the Parliament or of the Council, with the participation in each case of the other organs.
Although there #be not doubt that the Parliament will confirm tomorrow his safe -nomination that by #one *holgada majority-, in September will have to face up to a much more difficult proof in front of the Parliament in big part renewed and in front of the *cual, will have to present to his School in plenary, #as well as a program of action that no *le will engage only to *usted, to personal title, but that will engage *colegialmente to the new Commission in his group.
#If it do not wants to trip in the successive obstacles that will have to *sortear, will have to have very present that his legitimacy, like President of the Commission, is a legitimacy delegated, that will be exerted under the permanent political control of the Council and of the European Parliament, that, political and directly, are the managers in front of the #european population.
This coincidence, that was not foreseen in the normal calendar, gives to this debate and to the back vote a character *algo dramatic, because, in some mood, is the political will of the *primer European Parliament that it was able of *presionar to the salient Commission until the point of *obligarla to resign.
We have to remember that, #if we have to give a hope to the *Tercer World, with regard to the *cual now have a big responsibility -#can not forget, in effect, that *Europa is the greater economic structure of the world, repeat, the greater economic structure of the world- then is undoubted that also have to guarantee a world-wide economic order.
The opening of the trade has allowed, in the last years, some spaces of growth to #some countries that were totally excluded of the world-wide game and has brought achieve -understand it and has gone back to remember  in his interventions- *gravísimas consequences for #some #european sectors and #some #european countries.
In consequence, have to ask the *imputación of *Milosevic; an enormous pressure on the Mrs. *Harbour so that it explain finally how wants to take in the next hours; the informative bombardment and the integration of country that, gentleman *Fischer, are asking from takes more of twenty years, #if we think that in 1981 Frame *Pannella asked in this Parliament the incorporation of the that then was *Yugoslavia in the #european Community.
*Yo Also pray to the Commission and to the Council that take note that in our quality of members of parliament #can take *algo more that celebrate these debates, that no always result too much interesting neither stimulating, and that the Council and the Commission have to include more closely to the members of parliament in the formulation, but also in the execution of the politics.
Given the calendar of the Parliament, the Council considers that said query is not possible #if it wants to adopt  the common strategy in the Summit of June, #all time that the definite project of the document will not be available until 17 May.
*Yo Wanted to highlight in particular my opposition to the efforts of the speaker so that it postpone  the adoption of the relative common strategy to our relations with *Rusia, that is of the maximum importance in these moments, since said strategy *rebasa with grow the frame of the bilateral relations with this country.
#If we do not take advantage of now the opportunity to solve an illegal situation that is in conflict with the article 6 of the Treaty and, among other things, delete the discrimination by reasons of nationality that have kept from takes years, no longer will go back  to present the occasion; now we #can take it in justice and in *concertación with the Council.
It #can be that his exhibition of reasons technical-juridical have been fine, but have the impression of that #some of his adherents hide an unseen motivation and that it that really do not want to is that it touch  to #some of his privileges. Because they serve  of a series of arguments very odd.
About the buildings wanted to leave also *algo clear -#this goes directed to *usted, lady Speaker, and to the Presidency: we Have declared our disposal to assume finally the promotions *ad *personam , that presented  in an amendment delivered to the Mrs. *Müller, under the condition that the Presidency fulfil it agreed and make the finance of the buildings in a term of 10 years.
We take it essentially because we accept that Internet is a form surprisingly *excitante to make new transactions -expand the trade, the industry and the employment in the breast of the Community- but never to coast of the individual consumers in any Been member of the Union and, in the measure of it possible, *protegiéndolos no only inside the borders of the Union, but also out of #this.
So that this proposal of directive on the measures that have to adopt against of the pertinent pollution of the engines allocated to *propulsar the tractors follows the orientations of the directive of 1997 on the pertinent broadcasts of the engines installed in the mobile machines no of road.
The balance among the #european institutions, in effect, has changed to be the that the Treaties of *Maastricht and *Amsterdam pretended: it is to say, we have got to a Commission #whose nomination and political action do not base  already only in the confidence of the Council but of decisive mood in the confidence of the Parliament.
And the that we have reached this condition of Parliament mature and adult is very important for the democracy, because the democracy do not works only with fine intentions or with personal contributions, as #all know, but with institutions that go further of the human beings, that take that the work of the deputies that do not go to go back have continuity in other deputies.
Of course, it is a bit difficult that the Council congratulate to the President of the Parliament, as #if the praises are too much intense interprets  as #if it had taken *algo badly. Thus, I want to say that *usted is a speaker of the Council, an uncomfortable speaker, conciliatory but *inflexible *cuando treats  of the defence of the rights of the Parliament.
In Colony will treat  the following questions: first, the European Pact by the Employment; *segunda, the calendar for the institutional reform in *ciernes; third, the European Letter of Fundamental Rights; *cuarta, the common strategy for *Rusia and *quinta, the development of the European Politics of Security and of Defence.
It is clear that the collective defence in *Europa goes to follow being task of the NATO, but the European Union has to develop the capacity also for an own military management of crisis *cuando from the perspective of the Union or of the *UEO exist need to act and *cuando the North American do not want to or #can not take part.
We ask, to the equal that in the text of the month of November of 1997, #this is, in the resolution *Méndez Of *Vigo and *Tsatsos, a document of the Commission that #can constitute the base of #one *concertación *interinstitucional in the that are involved the representatives of the civil society, the national parliaments and the regions.
And *yo believe that, #if the Commission is in this line, #if the European Parliament is in this line, #if the national Parliaments have been involved, the legitimacy that will have this document will be enormous, and any Presidency in exercise and the Governments will be able to accept a document of reflection.
I consider that it is on of the table the need of an effective coordination of the economic politics and of a pact for the employment, it that demands the political will to use for this end the possibilities created by the euro.
The speeches pronounced in the Parliament have outlined little by little the outlines of a thought on *Europa with #a lot of positive looks, in particular the wish to guarantee the autonomy of the Commission and carry out a deep reform of his administrative uses.
Of course, it is also a big hit in the balance of our political group, as the amendment of the Group of the Greens has been the only that has obtained an absolute majority and that has taken that the Commission and also the Council move .
In the last years have assisted to successive positions of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade in relative subjects to the trade of sakes agricultural and alimentary and to the odd coincidence of these positions with the interests and pressures of the States Joined of *América.
The case of the banana reveals that the interest of the signatures multinationals explains one thousand times more that the development of the villages, and the market wins the hand to the necessary solidarities that it is necessary to develop in the breast of a political community.
Sure enough, regarding the relative conflict to the banana, in name of the liberalism and of the globalisation of the exchanges, the States members of the European Union lose his capacity to operate a specific and privileged politics with #some countries in roads of development with the *cuales kept historical exchanges.
Precisely in the case of the social Bottom, that produces with grow some great services to *Europa, already was in the politics on handicapped persons, in the preventive politics of labour market or in the helps to the women, #a lot of things have been very questioned until the last moment.
I want to express my congratulations especially to the speakers, the Mrs. *McCarthy, the Mr. *Hatzidakis, the Mr. *Collins, the Mr. #Walter, the Mr. Baron *Crespo and the Mr. *Arias *Cañete, also in his quality of president of the Commission of Politics Regional.
Apart from the useful increase of bottoms, the new financial regulation supposes an important advance for being a suitable instrument to provide finance on a long-term basis for projects on a long-term basis, because it includes programming *plurianual, it that means that the promoters of the projects will be able to schedule with a security without precedents on the finance that #can expect with charge to the budget for the networks *transeuropeas.
Like this it has to be, #if we want the maintenance of the social model European -of the that #can *enorgullecernos-, but with the idea that it has to be a realistic model, in the that the improvement of the conditions of work was a reflection of the improvement of the conditions of productivity.
they are carrying out In cooperation with the pertinent international organisations and regional initiatives and, especially, with the States of the region, with the goal to make a Conference on the pact of stability for the *Sureste of *Europa to level of high civil servants that will be summoned by the Presidency of the European Union in *Bonn the 27-5-1999.
The position of the Commission of Agriculture neither has supposed an advance in this sense and go back to have to regret the statement of *inadmisibilidad of an amendment of my Group in relation to the subject of the modulations of the helps.
I believe that it has been #one of the greater hits of this Parliament, but do not is necessary to forget thus that, in it that to the regulation of application refers  -and #this is the *segunda splits of the Report *Arias-, still have to ensure the continuity of some actions; continuity without the *cual, in my opinion, the structural politics *pesquera loses big part of his sense.
We go to take use of this power, gentleman President, and wanted to warn to the Council that are decided to take it to guarantee, in the first place, the opening and the transparency -and here *me *congratulo by the efforts that has made to this *respecto the group of work of the Council- and, second, to guarantee that it exists #one *ecuanimidad among the Parliament and the Council.
In fact, we consider that the common position of the Council represents a step advance to reach a better protection of the health and the security of the workers exposed to the risks of atmospheres explosive, that cause fatal accidents each day.
This agreement, that includes the commercial goals of the interim agreement, incorporates a social philosophy, #one *panoplia of possibilities for the cooperation in questions #such as the professional training, the regional development or the support to the cultural diversity.
And finally, gentleman President, by #all these reasons, wanted to say that my Group is adherent that the European Parliament approve this *dictamen satisfied, and with #the same decision and with #the same hardness with the that *nosotros condemn in his day the rapes of the human rights that had produced  in this country, with #the same firmness, repeat, ask that in this moment support  this *dictamen satisfied.
In the previous stage to the decision of the Council #can check how part of the personnel of the Secretariat of the Council  *opuso *frontalmente to the absorption of the employees of *Schengen *arguyendo that had not happened by the procedure of selection usual.
Formally, it do not needs to consult to the Parliament, but politically is not correct, since the integration of *Schengen in the Treaty, the election of the juridical base, determines how will develop  the future *acquis and, therefore, #which will be the paper of the Commission, the Parliament and the Court of Justice.
We do not forget, without embargo, that by #a lot of that the *SIS have incorporated  to the *tercer *pilar in virtue of the mechanism contemplated in the Protocol of *Schengen, the supervisory instance that watched by the correct application of the Agreement of *Schengen will continue exerting his work and will guarantee that the System of Information of *Schengen respect the protection of the personal data.
In the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens go to miss his open attitude, his constructive and independent character, even #if *nosotras two have had discrepancies regarding my use of his maternal tongue, the English.
Gentleman President, is a luck that *le have precisely to *usted in this moment of President of the Plenary of the Parliament because #this is #one of the last reports, #if no the last, of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and *usted has been during #a lot of years member very effective of this commission.
I appreciate to the Commission the have fulfilled his commitment to elaborate in #the same mandate the Green Book and the White Book of the trade, reaching that for the first time the Institutions tackled the sector of the trade in #all his looks.
His attitude -#if it allows that this law approve  by simple majority- will suppose that, in the future, a Friday in the morning of a day *nublado, with a majority of 48 votes against 47, a Parliament, by chance, will be able to abolish and destroy no only the financial perspectives, but the group of the building of cooperation *interinstitucional built during the twenty last months.
But, instead, I believe that this amendment is not admissible: it #can not  approve, by means of an amendment, after having argued a report that carries a different title, the text of an agreement, that, on the other hand, modifies noticeably varied parts of the report, although it treat  -in addition to the exhibition of reasons- of #some sections.
The that today *nos have abstained in the vote of the report of the Mrs. #Miranda of *Lage relative to the decision of the Council by the that establishes  an agreement of association economic and of coordination and political collaboration among the European Community and his States members on the one hand and the States Joined Mexicans by the #another obeys to varied reasons.
#If in the next General Assembly of the Nations Joined took  really this decision of a moratorium, believe that we will have directed a positive message to #all the countries of the world and will have posed a problem also in those countries that refuse to confront with decision this subject.
The *quinto look perhaps was the most positive of #all the process. It takes some days a president of the Constitutional Court has declared that #many of the legal disposals of *Turquía have to be modified because they attack against the human rights, because they attack against the rights of the democratic States.
It has chosen  a new President in *Djibuti. It is a good moment to remember that it has to put  end to the rapes of rights human, to the deal *humillante of the political prisoners, to the fault of rights of these prisoners, to the fact that  *les enclose in prisons without *otorgarles cares.
It is with this wish, gentleman President, that *me allow to express, through his person, my gratitude to the Table by the work developed in these five years, #as well as to the colleagues, especially the that take part in the meetings on the human rights and the problems of urgency, by the work made up to now and by #everything it that have learnt of *ellos.
Gentleman President, do not know how is it that it #would be necessary to take from the point of sight of the procedure, but *le ask, to *usted that it is an understood in #the same, that devise *algún mood that we #can take into account this event and show that sure enough we are to the so much of the real process in place of *aferrarnos to some dogmatic postures that do not contribute at all new and do not contribute in at all to resolve this tragedy.
The Commission has engaged  to continue with the initiative *SLIM/*INTRASTAT and the actions *EDICOM in favour of the companies, of compliance with the position of the Council on the needs of information in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union.
On this question said, and then was to the Commissioner *Cristoffersen: #this #can not follow like this, since there are #a lot of different systems of failure in the European Union; already it is hour that we #can create a #european anonymous society, no only to regulate jointly his creation but also his dissolution.
*B4-0338/99 of the deputies *Ferrer, *Peijs and *Chanterie in name of the Group of the Popular Party European on massive imports to low price in the textile market European, and-*B4-0339/99 of the deputy *Moniz in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists on massive imports to low price in the textile market European.
I think, in concrete, in the instruments of defence commercial that it has the European Union to delete the obstacles to the trade of the community products and also in the measures of *salvaguardia foreseen in the agreements of the Round *Uruguay that, maybe, the Commission #would have to adopt.
On the other hand, in the resolution on the communication of the relative Commission to the textile sector and of the preparation, and in #the same plan of action that afterwards elaborated the Commission, figure already a series of proposals in this direction.
A massive import in unsuitable conditions from diverse zones, among #others the Asian, that of a clearer way *nos concerns (and celebrate the special comment of the Mrs. *Gradin), #can give to the fret with the possibilities of this industry that -insist- has taken a big effort of adaptation.
#This considered that the reductions of charges social #can *falsear the competition among #european producers. It declared illegal the textile plan French, asked to the companies impossible repayments to satisfy and paralysed the enlargement to other sectors of this device allocated to save employments.
I will conclude mentioning the worry originated, in this sense, by the first statements of the Mr. *Prodi, that translate a very ideological conception of the notion of competition, since *él assimilates any regulatory action or *correctiva that carry out a State to a distortion of competition.
Gentleman President, *usted knows that I #be to be present in the sessions of the Fridays, but seldom ask the word because almost always are with #a lot of haste, have to take the planes, etc. Today, *excepcionalmente, being the last day of the present term of office and taking into account it early of the hour, *yo, in name of the Socialist Group, want *expresarle my recognition by his work like president of session.
Gentleman President, for the first time after ten years go to vote to choose to the President, or to the Speaker, of the European Parliament, without that it mediate #any of these previous agreements among the Groups *democratacristiano and socialist, that symbolised, in my opinion, a species of condominium that blocked the democratic debate.
In the breast of the Liberal Group have decided to support his candidature no to form a political coalition, but like political expression with regard to the partial period of constitutive sessions, because from time to time they require  political balances among the great political Groups Europeans.
With the decision of Colony relative to the celebration of a new Conference *Intergubernamental on the institutional subjects have opened, besides, the door to surpass very prompt the big second internal obstacle for the enlargement.
The #news that *Belgrado had accepted the conditions of peace got during the Summit of Colony of the month of June; and the resignation of the Commission after ten weeks of Presidency neither has facilitated at all the things.
Although our Group hailed explicitly the decision of the Summit of Colony to strengthen in the future the fundamental rights of the citizens and citizens and proposes  *apoyarla of active way, also criticise with #the same firmness the Pact in favour of the employment.
In the war of *Kosovo have seen how much weigh has to launch *Europa in the cymbal of the scales also under the perspective of the possibilities of configuration political that exist, of the possibilities that exist so that it #can practise  an external politics and of preventive peace, so that it #can promote  a solution to a conflict *cuando #this sharpens .
It is not a pomp of soap but that it is at last a concrete approach to get further of some guidelines by the employment to a coordination of the economic politics of the European Union, to organise a greater growth.
Without embargo, *me seems totally unsuitable not seeing the devastations that has produced the war, besides that in the *Balcanes, in the international legislation, in the international laws crushed, in the UN discredited and in the significant reduction of the autonomy of *Europa with regard to the Atlantic Alliance and the States Joined of *América.
Taking into account that a #roman donkey follow being it out of the #italian capital, as on the other hand it shows it the emblem of the list that, for the elections to this Parliament, carries his name, by coherence #can not *otorgarle my confidence for the Presidency of the Commission.
*Eso Showed perfectly, from the principle, his will of independence and his will to take that the Commission was without place to doubts, independent of the countries, independent of the national mentalities and also of the #ours political options here, in the Parliament, as it establishes the Treaty.
The range of resources to use in the external relations has to be consolidated with the end of *hacerlas more efficient, it is necessary to improve our capacity to warn the crises and it is necessary to increase our availability to react after the crises.
The commitment of *Europa #can not understand directed only to the reconciliation of the parts involved in the conflict, but that will measure  by the global capacity that will know to show to the hour to conciliate the Pact of Stability, the reconstruction and the unemployment always more increasing.
And here we have to be conscious of the fact that #if the development has to be harmonic, have to take upsetting in the word «justice», have to promote the #european judicial network, have to be able to give effectiveness to the sentences, take that the sentences are executive, so much the penal like the no penal, and have to facilitate the direct relation among the judges.
The development of the Union to a centralist federal model like the American it is necessary to avert it, and it is necessary to pursue a more decentralised Union #whose paramount principle  *acerque more to the model of confederation #swiss.
*Nos Seems an extraordinary fault of sensitivity in this concrete moment, in the current climate, having an interim Commission, that somebody #can in this situation simply say two days later that it wants to go  to work for a private company that it is #one of the main operators in the field of the telecommunications of the that is responsible.
Although it treats  of an observation that do not has at all that see with the debate in course, take advantage of this occasion to say that *me surprised very negatively the fact that usually, *cuando took part in the Committees of conciliation, the Commissioners were present and were #all mainstays less #one: the gentleman Commissioner *Bangemann, in spite of our complaints, did not take part never and sent to some civil servants.
With this end, the competent services of the Commission have gathered  regularly with the third states and have taken advantage of the session *plenaria of the *OMC/*SPS of the days 7 and 8 July to inform on the state of the question and of the legal performances undertaken.
It treats  of it following: *dígale to the Parliament how many veterinary and inspectors need , concern that the procedures to occupy the squares are faster and that the assignment of places inside the Commission was more dynamic, and then will be able to put in practice a better system of internal control in the Commission and also under his control.
We go to go back to open the negotiations with the *OMC and, to the equal that this Parliament in his group, expect of *ustedes, the Commission, that finally there are norms of health, environmental norms and social norms that avenge to limit, frame this theory, that day to day takes  more dangerous, of a free market #whose gain is the engine number #one.
Practically it has not taken out any education, from the point of sight institutional, of the so important crisis that the past month of March translated  by the collective resignation of the Commission, because of an irresponsible management.
It was an open popular party and friendly, that gave a big image of the sport, an image of the diversity of our squads and of our nations, an image of the existent fraternity in the breast of our continent.
In this moment see that there are some deputies in the Hemicycle that carry banners supporting a cause concerning the *cual the big majority, included *yo same, shares #the same favourable feeling, but #can *usted *indicarnos #any norm, #any rule or contribute #any guideline to this Assembly concerning demonstrations of any form that are not the interventions that make  according to the Regulation of the Parliament?
This Commission, the salient Commission, has celebrated it that probably went his last meeting the past Wednesday and, therefore, has not had occasion, in the brief lapse of time passed from the delivery of the document, to analyse in depth his content and take definite positions on #the same.
On the background of #all these considerations and the statements of today of the political leaders in this Assembly, guarantee by part of the Commission designated that the report goes to be treated like a fundamental ingredient of the proposals of reform of the Commission.
I believe that #this is precisely the decisive point: we have to learn to practise a successful management in the #european plane and #this only will reach  -it is necessary to say it with #all clarity to the Commission- #if we get here to common solutions among the Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
I say it because on 15 September - the Wednesday of this week, *cuando go to occur #a lot of things - is the date limit that it has given the Commission of Poured Radioactive of the Convention of *Ottawa to the #british Government to contribute proposals about how #can proceed  better to reduce the poured of radioactive substances in the half marine.
The *segunda #inspired -observation, clear is by my anxiety and by my big pity after the earthquakes of *Atenas- is that our environmental legislation, that will have to review and apply, did not includes still, or did not includes sufficiently, #if they want to, disposals referred to the uses of the earth, to the half urban, to the aggressions to the environment in the urban space.
The President designated of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, has left perfectly clear that proposes  guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work in narrow collaboration in the application of a program of work global in the Union during the next five years.
The impulse has given it the gentleman *Prodi, that has appointed a committee of experts to produce a *preinforme in name of the Commission *cuando the Council of Colony had refused explicitly this idea of the committee of wise persons.
In effect, in spite of the recommendations of the *primer inform of the committee of experts independent confirmed by the second inform that it finishes to publish , has not set up any initiative to modify the methods and the moods of operation of the Commission.
And #this because, further of the political balances in the distinct Institutions, there will be anyway a paper of the Council like representative of the Governments and a paper of the Commission and of the European Parliament, some Institutions with community and federal vocation and in what #such, engines of the integration.
In front of the Council that expresses the will of the national Governments and in front of a Parliament that is the expression of the villages, is necessary a strong Commission, responsible, call to propose apt initiatives to guarantee the aspirations of the #european citizens.
Gentleman President designated, along his intervention, *usted has insisted in a subject that *nos interests to a large extent, is to say, the need to undertake a fight by the #european identity, a fight without the *cual #can not  reach the ambitious goals that #all the villages of *Europa, this Parliament and #all the Institutions want to reach.
We expect that it impose  like priority the transparency in the operation of the European Commission, and that the main goals that pose  are the politics of protection of the citizens, of employment, of cultural progress, #as well as of solidarity bear with the villages that suffer by the fault of democracy and by the poverty.
Gentleman President designated of the Commission, #if today we had to choose among his *opositores and the reasons that have exposed and *usted, *nos #would find in difficulties perhaps until the point to have to *abstenernos or even vote to his favour, by it poor and unlucky that *nos seem the arguments that *esgrimen in this Plenary the last communist and the allies of *Milosevic against the NATO and our States, the conservative British and other.
Insisting in the political repercussion that have had the results of the recent elections to the European Parliament in the breast of the European Commission, until where have to get regarding restricting and impose to the national governments his election of the Commissioner?
#One third part of his candidates did not answer to the question of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of relative Opportunities to, the integration of the goals of equality among the men and the women in the general politics (*gender *mainstreaming).
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Commission, do not go to repeat it that already have expressed my colleagues of the *PPE and, in my quality of member of the #belgian delegation, do not go to introduce the #belgian inner politics in the debate.
The Mr. *Prodi *nos has said that it wants to that the Commission was an authentic #european Government and the Mr. *Poettering, president of the main political Group of this Parliament, has talked, even, also of this paper of the Parliament in relation with the European Commission.
So that the fight against the delinquency was effective, needs  a narrower cooperation among the States members, thing that translates  in an approach of the legislations, in the improvement of the police collaboration and in the coordination of the investigation of the offences.
The political challenge constituted by the asylum and the immigration requires a balance among the need of *salvaguardar the asylum like individual right and to offer the owed protection to the refugees, and the wish to offer resistance to the economic migration.
The extraordinary European Council of *Tampere has, beyond all doubt, a special importance, and *ello because it is called to configure political more complete for the freedom, the security and the justice in the European Union. In the European Union under his current form.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, receive with satisfaction the celebration of a European Council devoted in part to the space of freedom, security and justice, that testifies the taking of consciousness by part of the #european institutions and the States of the importance of the indispensable questions for the future of *Europa.
I observe with satisfaction that the Council and the Commission, with spirit *solidario, have adopted the necessary measures to guarantee to the #turkish authorities the help of the European Union and to cooperate with *ellas to end to relieve the sufferings of his village.
It is by it that our Commission of Subjects Constitutional asks that the European Parliament do not occupy a merely secondary place in a so important process, but that it #can collaborate in foot of equality with the Council, enjoying of #the same capacity of initiative and of decision.
It #would owe  also establish, as it foresees it the own Treaty of *Amsterdam, an effort *equitativo among #all the States members to confront the consequences that derive  of the received of refugees, persons displaced or the strong migratory pressures that have nature exclusively economic, like the that have his origin in the #mediterranean third countries or the flank south of the Union.
Of course, lady Speaker of the Council, that the migratory politics is inseparable part of the external politics, but in #a lot of occasions the external politics subjects  to #others *designios, *designios that they #can finish going back against the humanitarian look related with the politics of asylum and with the migratory politics.
Although it have been engendered among the fifteen prime ministers, #this is now his own government, released of the control of the countries members, *distanciado of the national parliaments, to years light of the constituents of on foot and of the fiscal taxpayers and without having been subjected still to the control of the European Parliament.
In these historical moments in that the Basques bet by the #european construction like democratic path of understanding, conciliation and peaceful coexistence with #all the Spaniards, #as well as with #all the other villages of *Europa, it that less need, it that more #can affect to the peace that look for and long for is that it do not respect  #ours residual fiscal sovereignty, our economic concert.
The maintenance of the criteria of *Maastricht and of the Pact of Stability deprives of the lower credibility to the "European Pact for the Employment", it that, together with the insistence in the *flexibilización of the relations of work, reveals clearly that it bets  by #one *desreglamentación every time greater of the labour relations.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the capacity of the Commissioners to answer to the enormous expectations that have aroused and to introduce a very different type of behaviour and of culture in the new Commission, *nos took to expect the demonstration of a capacity to effect true reforms, transcendental and radical.
President *Prodi, wish #a lot of luck and #a lot of hit to the Vice-president Palace, that will commission  of the relations with the European Parliament and of #whose qualities am more that convinced, #as well as to #all the active commissioners in my field of work -the Mr. *Patten, the Mr. *Verheugen and especially the Gentlemen *Reding and *Vitorino, that have been #ours colleagues during years-.
The assignment of these bottoms supposed an important challenge for the credibility of the European Union, and the fact to have  approved without modifications in the Commission of Budgets is a proof of this big responsibility to the that *me referred.
The behaviour of the national authorities in these subjects has to adapt to the valid legislation of each country under the control of his political and juridical organs, and has to respect the international norms of protection of the human rights.
But it is that, besides, I believe that the Council has answered correctly and #would be well that the socialist deputy, that besides is spokesman of his delegation, took the duties and studied a bit more how is *eso of the #european construction and did not leave in ridiculous to his parliamentary group with questions on questions that are not community competitions and that they have to solve in the national field.
But the necessary coordination #can not give place never to that any Been member of the European Union evade his own responsibility: neither the State neither #any of the administrations that compose the territorial political-division, as it has occurred in the case of reference in my country.
The States members, in the measure of it possible and to instances of the country President of the Union, will continue his work of *adecuación of the common positions with the project of Convention and also will try to get to agreements in the questions that influence of important form in the interests of the Union.
In the Council of Subjects General of the past June took  a decision, by the *cual the Commission will have to present during the month of September a proposal that ensure that the politics of the Union in the sector *platanero fulfil the norms of the *OMC.
As it will know the Assembly, the proposal of the Commission is relative fundamentally to the creation of an agency that commission  to apply the programs of reconstruction community, initially in *Kosovo, but later, *cuando the circumstances allow it, also in other regions of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia as Serbian and *Montenegro.
To take into account the evolution of the political situation in the region, the article 6 of the Agreement establishes that, at the end of the year 2000, will be reexamined the advances in matter of refugees and will evaluate  likewise the eventual programs of the *OOPS relative to the incorporation of the #palestinian authorities to his functions.
After it that have said before and also after it that has said the Mr. Commissioner *Kinnock this morning in name of the Commission and of it that *nos informed yesterday the #finnish Presidency of the Council in the sense that by the moment did not exists any *margen of performance to attend our amendments, pray to the colleagues that give his favourable vote.
Practically, in each section of his resolution, the European Parliament expands the interpretation of the decision of the Council of Colony, to end of *ensoberbecerse, of *marginar to the national Parliaments and to prepare the transformation of the future Letter in #european Constitution.
The workers have #all the interest in resisting  to the projects that are boosting , in putting to the discovered the hypocrisy of the European Union and of the States members and in changing, with his fight, these changes that put in danger his public freedoms.
But #all repeat it same: they are discouraged by the corruption; the conditions of investment are very *desfavorables, because it did not exists a viable fiscal system on a long-term basis, the laws change constantly, the infrastructure is scarce and, it that it is worse, the rights of property, included the rights of property intellectual, are deficient and garbled.
Gentleman President, seems that *Encélado is very angered with #Grecia and *Turquía and that, as it is a perfect ignorant of the dialogue and of the relations, has given loose rein to his rage of a catastrophic form, seeding the death, the anxiety, the pain, the despair and the crying in the two countries.
Gentleman President, the fight by the power in the Islamic Republic of will go among adherents of the conservatism and adherents of the reformism continues without diminishing until today, with #all the consequences that #this comports for the State of Right, is to say, the no application of the general principles of the State of Right.
When opening the session, *usted has announced that they have approved  #some initiatives and that have given  concrete answers to the parliamentary press, but, repeat, believe that it is necessary to take more to convert in easier the work of the journalists, so as to take to know to #all the European Union the important work that makes this Parliament.
Lady Speaker, *me cheer that Unit already have tackled the problem of the communication because apart from the failures - *yo #would say - human of this building, that on the other hand is very prestigious *arquitectónicamente, but inside the *cual there #be really #a lot of #stray space that #can not  use, believe that there #be also #a lot of problems of transport.
The massive industrial pollution of the foods by the use of additives, without respecting a reliable maximum limit, creates in the consumer the impression justified that the production of *forraje is yielding terrain in front of the utilisation of *piensos.
It wanted to say that the list of possible functions at all is exhaustive and, #if it existed the obligation to prepare an annual report and #if his civil servants appeared periodically in front of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer of the Parliament, #can guarantee  also his surrender of accounts.
All *ello with the end to be able to warn always the problems, in place to run preys of the panic *cuando the problems already have produced  and have *quebrantado the confidence of the #european citizens, in addition to causing grave damages to the public health.
Like this, the most affected states by the illness #would have to enjoy of the right to the compulsory licences that *les allow to produce, to the lower cost, generic treatments *anti effective HIV to avert the apparition of illnesses opportunist that conduct inevitably to the death.
This fact has a scope and a gravity without precedents by the form in that this illness affects very especially to a continent with the *cual the European Union keeps some relations and some peculiar bonds that, to my understand, have  *entibiado totally in these years and that have failed entirely his goal.
Thus the Commission of Budgets has proposed to the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy that demand a partial review of the financial perspectives and has achieved to include in this report a positive quotation on the subject.
*Yo Appreciate a lot and *me *congratulo, lady Commissioner, that the responsibility in this so important field *le correspond to *usted, as in his quality of #ex-Minister of #spanish Agriculture *usted already knows well that, in the frame of the #european agricultural politics, surely results much more reasonable to reduce the #obtaining of *excedentes that devote useful surfaces to the *aprovechamiento energetic of the biomass.
Gentleman President, *acaso it that more cheers of this agreement is that with *él happen of the rhetoric to the facts and the European Parliament, that has *propiciado and has followed of wall the process of negotiation giving impulse and acting like spur, #would owe today affirm that it will put #the same energy in the follow-up of the application of the agreement and his results.
In conclusion, #if well I receive with satisfaction that *Sudáfrica have reached a participation in important #european markets, expect that we also take advantage of the educations that give off of this agreement and watch by that in the future the rhythm, the *escalonamiento and the field of application of the agreements of free trade reflect more faithfully the different needs of the countries participants.
All it that the #european institutions offer to *Sudáfrica in matter of cooperation is a commercial agreement painstakingly negotiated so that the interests of the trade and of the #european industry are advantageous, an agreement that will not benefit to *Sudáfrica, only to this *ínfima minority of exporters of lovely stones and of agricultural products that have been the main *beneficiarios of the apartheid.
On the other hand, we do not imagine, gentleman Commissioner, that consider the possibility to increase the current level of the imports of the European Union in #south african wines -*les remember that they are 320.000 *hectolitros- without preserving a minimum of rights *arancelarios, save to risk to disturb gravely #all the #european sector.
After the transfer of some number of Directors General the past week, today have decided to take public the vacancies for the following places: general director of the General Directions of Companies, Agriculture, Education and Culture; *vicedirectores generals of the following Directions: Education and Culture, Competition and External Relations.
The difference among the parliament of a dictatorship and a democratic parliament is that the parliament of a dictatorship is always full and applauds , and a democratic parliament is not very full, because the persons is working in other spots.
Clear that it is a challenge, in addition to it that said before when answering to the question of the Mr. *Cox: begin to conceive a type of bureaucracy suitable for the goals that want to achieve and afterwards select to the better persons, with some consequences that, in #some moments, *descompensan notably the balances among the States.
I confirm to the European Parliament that, in the frame of the regulation of the Structural Bottoms, with the at present available credits #can contribute a substantial help to the #greek population that has seen  affected, is to say, wall of 20.000 homes, without talking of varied *cientos of victims.
The help to the displaced loans  through the International #Red Cross, whereas the Federal #Red Cross and the national societies of #Red Cross find  immersed in the enlargement of a program of canteens public, to the that the THROW will follow loaning his help.
Subject: Celebration of the first annual summit *UEIndia In his report To4-0066/99 of the 12.3.1999, on the communication of the Commission on the increase of the association Indian-EU, the *PE asks "to the Council and to the Commission that propose to the #indian Government celebrate annually a summit #indian-euro".
*Turquía Has to work still a lot and is necessary that advance still of considerable mood so much in the political field as in the economic, but in front of the enormous strategic importance of *Turquía for the future of *Europa, for the security, stability and the peace in *Europa, #would be a grave error *negarle the inclusion with #the same rights in the process of enlargement.
Nevertheless, to speed up this process believe that it is necessary *sopesar seriously the proposal of the president Mr. *Pöttering to fix a diary of meetings regular among *Turquía and the European Union, so as to debate of democracy and human rights, of minorities, of economic and social development, of security and external politics.
The process is a complex process - has remembered it the gentleman Commissioner *Patten - and, without embargo, today have even terms and steps in the *cuales will take place some facts that allow to discern the final solution, is to say, the recognition of two sovereign States and independent that #can coexist on the base of a reciprocal security.
And *ello in spite of it stipulated in the article *K.6 of the Treaty of *Maastricht, in the sense that the ministers of the EU will consult regularly to the Parliament on the main looks of the activity in the fields of the justice and of the subjects of interior and will watch by that his opinions "take  properly in account" .
Without embargo, the contradiction among the #european decision to raise the embargo and the #french refusal to take it creates an unsustainable situation, that shows, *cuando still have not fulfilled  six months from the ratification of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the *inconsecuencia of #the same that the have supported.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen Deputies, this debate that have wished to celebrate on the new cycle, poses, in my opinion, an important question: The Union contributes, by his own action, to the governments and to the #european citizens supplementary means to adapt  with hit and to dominate the globalisation?
*Finlandia Has proposed that the Council declare his intention to continue in the future Presidencies developing indicators and *benchmarking for other critical fields determined in the plan of action of the Conference of *Pekín and to engage  to study periodically the advances in the matters that argue .
It is precise and urgent that from #all the institutions of the European Union take a serious call to the Governments of *Rusia and of *Chechenia to finish with the bellicose climbing, to take *callar the arms and restart the political dialogue, using for *ello #all our springs -of the type that went- to be able to be listened.
*B5-0171/1999 of the Mr. *Salafranca *Sánchez-*Neyra and the Mrs. *Grossetête, in name of the Group of the *PPE, on the vote of a resolution of the General Assembly of the Nations Joined on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of the capital penalties.
The urgency is owed to that a fiscal substitute of the #italian Republic has presented an order in that they appreciate  grave responsibilities of high controls of the aeronautical for having concealed, have *silenciado and have not contributed to say it that knew so that it cleared  this case that *sucedió almost twenty years backwards.
Lady Speaker, wish to pose a statutory question put that the deputies finish to receive a yearbook, edited, when seeming, by the House of Trade American in *Bélgica, in the that it takes  a repertoire of the deputies to the European Parliament, indicating his references.
Already it is hour that it believes  juridical security by means of the approval of norms only for the providers of services of certification, on the one hand, and, also for the users, by #another, the *cuales -the same that in the utilisation of the cards of credit- will know with accuracy in how measured *les looms the danger of a responsibility.
I was the only speaker, together with the Mr. *Bourlanges, that gathered  with representatives of the agencies and have listened fine arguments so that they increase  the bottoms of the that have for the work that take with the countries candidates of *Europa central and oriental and to introduce in the market medicines no commercial that are of vital importance for a relatively small number of persons with difficult illnesses to treat.
Gentleman President, lady Speaker of the Council, lady Commissioner *Schreyer, *Señorías, the women are the half of the sky, as it already said an ancient #chinese proverb, and is very logical that the women of the European Union take part also in this proportion in the budget of the Union.
It True is that the Council in fact has declared in this context: we want to fund an important task for the future and also in the actuality, that surely will prolong  varied years, specifically, the help for the population of *Kosovo, and for *financiarla go to apply a cut of the 10 % in #all the budgetary lines.
Like effect, the initiatives of the #european citizens precisely see  braked, and therefore the reform of the Commission will have to contribute to an improvement of the service by means of a more effective cost, transparent and in accordance with the political elections of the budgetary authorities.
We have treated to answer to the no written norm to avert an excessive number of games and notes in the budget.
This amendment foresees the *consignación of a credit of 50 millions of euros in the financial reservation for the finance of the actions of the producers or States members that establish a control of quality integral in the whole of the alimentary chain.
Likewise, the European Parliament has invited to members of the Executive Committee of the #ECB and of his personnel to take part in other audiences on varied specific subjects, among *ellos the external representation of the *SEBC, the preparation of the notes of euros and questions of statistics.
The #ECB will act like catalyst of the change and, together with the national central banks of the *SEBC, will treat these subjects with the banking sector of the zone of the euro to end to exert a paper of support and coordination in this sense.
#This is the first occasion in the that the European Parliament has given his point of sight about the advances of the Central Bank European and, in this context, is my *grato owe the congratulate to the #ECB and to the Mr. *Duisenberg, like president, by his hit until the moment.
Thus, gentleman President of the Central Bank, believe that the meeting of this day, and mainly the *contrapoder ridiculous that tries to exert the Parliament in regard to the considerable can that  *le has entrusted to *usted, #can not more that concern to #all the that believe in the national sovereignty, that for the villages only is a form to control his destination.
Also I believe that the financial markets and the citizens of *Europa will not expect less of this new Central Bank, and that this Parliament will have to be relentless when pursuing the goal of a Central Bank open and democratic European for the near future.
But in the Treaty of *Maastricht did not take out the institutional consequences that  *dereivaban of this decision, and therefore we are talking today of the independence of the Central Bank, of the lace of the Central Bank with other institutions and of the pending problems.
In any case, have got to the majority position of my Group, basing this decision in the fact that the point of sight mentioned #can diminish, instead of increasing, the confidence of the market in the activity of the Bank.
For example, it exists our document that publishes  immediately after the meetings of the Council of Government that contains the considerations that have been important in the definite decision of the Council of Government in the case that they have changed  or no the types of interest.
By the contrary the editorial "without damage" clears, and #that is his intention, that the system of the euro did not has any obligation to act of this mechanical form #if it estimates that take it like this #would engage the stability of prices in the future.
And third question: #can deduce  of it that today have argued that THROW will keep his full identity to pipe the humanitarian help of the European Union in situations of crisis, or, rather, that the performance of THROW and the own humanitarian help will dilute  progressively inside the general politics of cooperation for the development of the Union?
They are too much numerous the politicians and the politics, the journalists, the defenders of the human rights and the citizens that have paid with the life his fight by a juster society and more human.
It did not treats  to create a new instance of review of the catalogues of rights fundamental national, but yes a juridical right that affect to the performance of the #european institutions and to the legislation that takes  for the citizens.
#If we consider it in his whole, the report of the Mr. *Dehaene pretends, on the one hand, the extension of the qualified majority and, to #the same time, the *constitucionalización of the Treaties and his division in two parts, a subjected to a very strict procedure, that requires unanimity for the reform, and #another by majority.
This last initiative of the EU, that comes to complement #others to national level, will help to create the suitable regulatory frame that allow to the #european companies be to the avant-garde of the development of services commercial electronic.
Like this, when favouring the free circulation of the capitals in the world-wide level, when pretending liberalise even more the investments, the #european governments transform the bottoms of pensions #anglo-saxon in authentic *regentes of the economic and financial markets.
I believe that, by the contrary, it is necessary to put in cloth of trial the social model European that is the social model of the *Europa of the unemployment, of the taxes, of the *Europa with a union that has an enormous power that blocks the economic growth and forbids to millions of #italian unemployed, French and Germans, #as well as to millions of immigrants find work, to protect situations that, with frequency, are not more that situations of privilege.
*Eso Wants to say that inside the Union it is necessary to get to a true coordination of the fiscal politics and to a formulation of norms social comparable for #all so that they do not go back to produce  the distortions of the competition that still result very sensitive today.
*Cuando A simple operation of communication allows to the *cotización of a company win the 12%, in spite of not to have created value #any, not to have produced neither sold any supplementary tyre, taking believe that simply they #can appear spontaneously wealths by the simple mechanism of the financial markets, is a total contempt of the human work.
The European Union adopted in July of 1999 a common posture, #whose goal is to intensify the cooperation in the frame of the to scale international actions to achieve the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs.
The Union supports the works *preparativos of the commission commissioned to create the Organisation of the Treaty of prohibition total of proofs and to elaborate to time and with efficiency the system of *comprobación of the planned form in the treaty.
It is necessary to guarantee to the less talked tongues the finance that deserve, of it contrary, excellent innovative projects - the theatre, the translation of literature after the end of the project *Ariane - and the education of languages, among other things, will suffer the consequences.
It wanted to say simply that the amendment 4 on the *comitología is accepted in principle by a simple reference in the text to the procedure of management established by the disposal of the Council, of 28 June 1999, by the that fix  the modalities of the exercise of the competitions of execution conferred to the Commission.
The report of the Council of *Europa on Politics of coherent family and integrated says: "The families have a paramount paper in the socialisation, because they transmit the values, the norms, the habits and the behaviour of the social group to the that belong his children.
Gentleman President, want to say in the first place that, of compliance with the article 157, by means of letter of 6 July 1999, the Council consulted to the Parliament on the proposal of decision of the relative Council to the participation of the Community in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector.
It wanted to take upsetting in that the activities of the Observatory and of *Eurostat do not coincide in terms of the period that covers, the geographic scope or the result, and #can be coordinated of an useful way to reach a clear vision of the complex reality of the audiovisual sector.
In this moment, the terrorists have been detained, the hostages have been released, but had account of the gravity of it occurred, and #if His *Señorías agree, will express, in name of the European Parliament, our solidarity and our condolence to the village *armenio, in a letter directed to the President of the Republic of *Armenia.
Gentleman President, in name of the Socialist Group *me #would enjoy to say that we support the approval of the agreement *interinstitucional, a fundamental piece in the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union by the form in the that tackles the problem of the fraud and treats the indictments of fraud
The coincidence of the announcements has put to the nude, of flagrant way, the scandalous and unfair look of the current economic logic and of this financial capitalism, that has finished for dominating *Europa and the world.
The present proposal pretends an extension of the transitory period previously mentioned until 1 July of the 2001, or even more, for the case of the transport of some squads to pressure, on the that they do not exist technical specifications detailed or sufficient quotations in the corresponding #european norms.
I am conscious, without embargo, of the need of *prorrogar the periods of the directive 96/49, with the end that the States members do not see  in the need to modify his national legislations for a brief space of time, thing that #would involve additional costs for the states and for the industry.
Like this as, today it is urgent to detain the privatisations, increase the personnel and occupy seriously of his training, establish the necessary budgets allocated to the maintenance and to the control of #the same, create committees of control professional/users on the traffic, impose a right of veto in front of the transfers *cuando the risks are real.
These negotiations will take place in a concrete context, marked by two new elements; by a part, the disappearance of His Majesty *Hassán *II, the last giant of the history of the century *XX and, on the other hand, the principle, accepted takes #some days, of the candidature of adhesion of *Turquía.
Without embargo, it is necessary to regret the *tardanza, that has created a social alarm and a state of nerves in the fleet that #can have averted, and the speculations and pronouncements that #can take worse that well to some negotiations that, by the importance of the agreement, #would have to develop in a discreet frame, calm and cordial.
Think it that think  of the agreement of fishing, regarding the consequences for the local population or for the fleet of fishing #european, there will be *poca persons that want to put to #the same level the humanitarian disasters like the had in *Kosovo, *Timor Oriental and the earthquake of *Turquía with this agreement in matter of fishing.
On 30 November it is next and seems that it goes  to conclude a new agreement, therefore, with a scarce attention by part of the Commission to the economic level of the regions of the Goals 1 and 2 that, depending to a large extent of the exercise of the fishing, warm up serious worries of face to the maintenance of the employment in the sector.
In the summit of #Florencia, celebrated in January of 1996, the Bosses of Government agreed that the decision to raise the embargo to the Realm Joined #would take  "pure and exclusively on the base of the public health and of scientific criteria goals, in accordance with the existent procedures that satisfy to #such criteria" .
We want common sense and want to base our decisions in the science because, in the differences that produce  in the future -and will produce  #many about the *inocuidad of the foods, because the consumers are very concerned now by the foods that buy-, the scientists, the objectivity and the independence of the scientists is absolutely crucial.
*Yo #Would not say it same of #all the sectors of our #european relations; neither it #would say it of our relations with the third countries, without embargo, in the breast of the Union, exists beyond all doubt a common agricultural politics and a responsibility of #all with regard to this politics.
Although in the frame of the #european politics the infringement of the Treaties was a fundamental criterion for #all *nosotros, like deputy of my electoral district #can not *mantenerme out of the political debate with this argument in the current circumstances.
It finishes to know  that the Minister of Agriculture #british, that belongs to his party, not even has established the dialogue with his homologous French, *algo that results ridiculous, #if it considers  the form in that they are  *caldeando the spirits in the process of this commercial war.
The Commission has taken well in agreeing a protocol of only a year, so much more what that during the last years the #angolan authorities have been victims of intense abuses, especially by part of the #russian fleet. This situation has caused a spectacular fall of the activities *pesqueras.
Although, sure enough, they have to complete some data or statistical on the that the Commission *nos has promised that goes to be strict, and having also in account the delicate situation in that it finds  that country -in state of war-, consider that the signature of this protocol of application provisional is very positive, #waiting for the renewal by a year or to that elaborate  a new Agreement.
So that the euro receive the weight that deserves, no longer only in the international economy, but also in the economic political-dialogue in the area of the Union, it is necessary to deepen in the common visions, especially, in matter of economic politics in the zone of the euro.
Our own investigations reveal that the economic development in the traditional sense is resulting limited in some zones by fault of the fault of water drinkable and because the European Union produces already more toxic waste that the that it #can tackle like by-product of the economic growth.
According to this institution, the own drivers, the carriers that work out of the sector of the transport, #such as the transport of concrete in the sector of the wood and of the construction, belong to the category of workers mobile.
The Commission of Employment and Social Subjects of the Parliament refuses this interpretation, in part, because these workers remain, then, partially out of the field of application of the relative existent directive to the ordination of the time of work.
The time that the Council concedes to the States members and, therefore, to himself/hisself same to adopt the directive that modifies the current relative directive to the ordination of the time of work, situates , according to the common position of the Council, in four years.
The effect of this amendment will be the to try limit to a year the period of reference available for the annual computation of the calculation of the labour day or, said of another mood, watch by that it was possible said annual computation, but no more.
Gentleman President, in a free market with boundless competition, the company that produce to a better price has the best opportunities of survival, also *cuando the product only #can be cheap by the bad labour conditions, the low wages, the environmental pollution or the cruelty with the animals.
Also it exists another look of the agreement that is surrounded of #a lot of secret. I take for granted that *cuando apply  the point 5 of the annex on intellectual property do not take  of a literary way, but that more in concordance with the general rules of opening that fortunately govern in the actuality in our Union.
In the first place, they are agreements that approved  quickly, by it that it wanted to appreciate to #all the speakers, #as well as to the members of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence and of the Commission of Budgets, that have examined the proposals in brief terms.
In the Realm Joined there #be a particular interest in the saving of fuels by the excessive levels of taxes fixed by our Government *laborista for the fuels, that pose particular problems to the residents in rural zones, like the #mine, in the that many times the public transport is non-existent.
*Yo Believe that #this is in reality #one of the central points of the directive: sensitise to the consumer on the problem so that it begin to concern  a bit by the reduction of the broadcasts of CO2 *cuando treats  of his favourite mate, the car, and include also this look in his considerations.
In the first place, from the Parliament want to be intimately associated with #all and each #one of the steps of the cycle that poses  in the inner market with the selection of the strategies, with the selection of the goals of second level and with the selection of the concrete goals.
And here *yo wanted to signal to the Mr. *Lehne that, definitely, has not read  the strategy of the Commission when saying that the social considerations were out of #this, because the strategic goal number 1 that has fixed the Commission is to improve the quality of life of the citizens.
To the directive on the electronic signature *le will follow surely, among #others, the directives on the electronic trade and the rights of author in the society of the information, and on the protection of the consumers in the sale to distance of financial products.
This sentence *nos carries to the question of the *conceptuación of the defence of the consumers like a requirement *inexcusable to prevent the free circulation of commodities, in the sense of the jurisprudence *Dassonville, *Cassis of *Dijon, etc. In definite, *nos conducts to the principle of the mutual recognition, that seems to be very wanted by the Mr. *Bolkestein.
It is precise to conciliate the reforms directed to the promotion of the dynamic competition and of the flexibility with the requirement of the maintenance, and also of the modernisation, of the system of security social. Like this I understand the #european model.
Gentleman President, *yo also appreciate to the speaker his excellent work and have to put of relief that the irrefutable data that has seen to drop the unemployment of the 10,1 to the 9,4 has to be valued positively, to the equal that the politics carried out by the European Union in matter of employment with the four *pilares fundamental, to the *cuales *me allow to add, anyway, the linguistic training and the problem of the immigration.
It has remained patent that from Colony advance some processes, the processes of the autumn and of the spring, but, how doubt fits, am always #waiting for proposals and practical procedures of materialisation of this narrower collaboration, that, anyway, gives  in a first stage in the corresponding commission, is to say, in the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects.
Only a Parliament that treats of *desterrar the political statements and the political signatures to the basements, a Parliament that, in fact, is governed by bureaucratic logics #can allow that the situation of discrimination of the no inscribed deputies that have less right that the other deputies, follow being #the same, from takes months.
Lady Speaker, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, although #all have supported the relative reports to the situation of the employment, are of the opinion that the tax of unemployment in *Europa is dramatically high and that against #this *nos  *nos occurs any effective recipe so much in the national states as in the #european plane.
The European Union and the States national members in #all moment have to work in narrow relation with the #european industries of the car and of the oil to guarantee that, of a time for ever, will disappear the pollution in a near future.
This program is important and answers to the commitment that *nosotros have to reach a high level of protection to the health in the European Union, as *nos follow tripping still with frequency with the effects of the violence in the Community. The *cuales constitute a very grave threat for the health.
Gentleman President, of course that I do not have at all against of the fact that a part of the budget devote  to the preventive measures against the violence exerted on the boys, the teenagers and the women, always that it apply  to a financial help awarded to the associations that occupy  of these subjects.
The present proposal will guarantee minimum standards of information and query that it is necessary to apply in #all the territory of the Union harmonising these fundamental rights of the workers - that already are presents in #a lot of States members - and contributing to the strengthening of the #european social dimension that it is the goal that #all have.
In fact, we attribute special importance to #the same and besides forms part of a wider matter that it has to see with the preparation and the accompaniment with a view to the changes in course in the labour market, so as to that #this do not produce negative results, especially in it that to the security of the workers and of his place of work refers .
I have proposed that  *instituya a suspension of six months for #all plan of restructuring, to allow an independent #sindical advice, and also have proposed that, #if the company receives public helps but do not respects the norms established, has to return the sums perceived.
Gentleman President, in my quality of speaker of the Agreement *interinstitucional of the *cual derives this decision, wanted to know the position of the Commission, because it has not pronounced  to the *respecto, on the proposal that take to exclude of the guideline the planned costs for the future adhesion.
Independently of it that think  on this source of electricity, do not fits doubt that it supplies an important part of our electricity in *Europa and takes it of a mood that do not produces broadcasts of CO2 neither of other gases that cause the effect of *invernadero and #that is the reason -the only reason- by the that has mentioned  in this report.
The sustainable development is not only a noble goal, is an obligation imposed by the Treaties, by it that it has to constitute the fundamental principle of any future energetic politics #european and to #the same time it is necessary to reach a balance.
I support the initiatives in the #european level that contribute to the measures adopted by the States members to fulfil his commitments with arrangement to the Protocol of *Kyoto on the limitation of the broadcasts of gases that cause the effect of *invernadero by part of the energetic sector.
It is necessary to keep the quota of energy atomic for the electrical production at least to the current level and perhaps there #be even that *aumentarla lightly to be able to get to the ambitious goal of reduction of the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon, to the that *Ustedes, estimated friends, lady *Plooij- go *Gorsel and lady *Ahern, #as well as #all the other in this Hall, have engaged .
In the practice, a similar proposal #would translate  in the arrest of the development of the renewable energies in the 5% as in any country there #be a minister of Inland revenue that want to fund the development of projects in other countries.
Gentleman President, in the first place want to appreciate and congratulate to the Mr. *Chichester by his positive and constructive report on the communication of the Commission to the Council and to the Parliament with regard to the consolidation of the environmental integration of the community energetic politics.
Without place to doubts this regulation supposes a remarkable step forward, by it that *le give the thanks to the Mrs. speaker, without embargo, will have to go back to tackle this subject regarding the nomadic boys, the boys of race #gipsy and, in consequence, to #all the internal problems of these families, among the that they explain  the related with the mobility in *Europa.
Said installation is obsolete, according to the classification taken by the Executive in the Diary 2000, in the *cual the nuclear head offices divide  in three categories: the of #soviet or obsolete type that they have to dismantle for being dangerous; the head offices that it is necessary to reform for *permitirles reach levels of acceptable security by part of the Union and the of western type, #whose number is lower, that #can follow working, with #such that the level of security follow being elevated on a long-term basis.
The abandonment of the use of the nuclear energy with civil ends do not appears in the agenda and is necessary to have present the implications of character economic and social of the decisions that the Union demands that they adopt the countries of *Europa central and oriental.
It remains of self-evident that it is in #one of these fields, to know the threat that represents the existence of *tantas nuclear head offices, but also of #all these armaments accumulated in the territory of the ancient Soviet Union, #where #any of the States members #can not pretend, only, act in favour of the security of the group of the continent.
Concerning the situation in *Alemania on the that *me has asked His *Señoría my conversations with the competent minister of *Alemania *me have allowed, as I have said before, conclude that the Federal Government of *Alemania wishes to advance to the lifting of the prohibition and that the resultant conversations of the difference with *Francia will dissipate #all the worries that #can *subsistir in *Alemania.
#This is my answer: the relative directive to the nitrates covers no only the pertinent nitrogen of the animal muck, but also of the #fertiliser chemists regarding the quantities employed, see the article 5 and the annex *III, and to the methods and periods of dissemination, that appear in the annexes *II and *III.
The Commission believes that the majority of the measures that have to adopt the States members -for example, the supervision of the transposition, the indication of the zones and the codes of fine behaviour, the programs of action and the presentation of reports- are simple.
The reality is that -as it signals the information supplied by the own #greek authorities- has produced  an excessive presence of the Administration in the direction of the company, and the commitments of the year 1998 #would have to have put end, once and for all, to this situation.
Subject: legislative Harmonisation in the Czech Republic Has the Commissioner knowledge of a study directed to the Commission elaborated by four #czech parties of the opposition in the that it examines  the slowness of the transposition and the legislative harmonisation in the Czech Republic and how conclusions extracts of #the same?
Another party that has governed before, #one of the great parties of the opposition, has said that it #can have an adhesion to the letter; it talks  in addition to a #turkish status, of a political discount and wanted to *preguntarle #if it considers feasible #such theoretical models or #if it puts like previous condition the full application of the *acquis *communautaire.
Even *me *atrevería to say, in name of the Green/Free Alliance European, that the majority of our Group seems to have taken to the idea that the European Union #can develop common performances for the management of the crises. But we want to establish conditions and guidelines very defined for this management.
*Me #Would enjoy to know, gentleman #Solana, #which are the political means, the economic and budgetary means -had account of the principle of "the that pay commands" , that *usted knows very well of his period of Secretary General of the NATO-, to achieve a strength that #can keep the peace and avert situations so dramatic like the that have lived recently in the *Balcanes.
*Yo Also consider the Council of the historical Monday, but in negative sense and by #others #a lot of reasons and here *me refer to the position adopted - incomprehensible - with regard to an initiative, promoted by a time by the European Union, #this is, the moratorium to the pity of death.
Gentleman Commissioner, is not very difficult to comprise that it that we had to have taken was to win supports through a serious negotiation, moderate countries that do not apply the pity of death, but that had positions and sensitivities with regard to the preamble - insist in the preamble - of reference to an article of the Letter of the Nations Joined.
I have to say that the relative legitimate worry to the military capacity do not disappears with the "*europeización" of the defence, that answers to a fundamental political plan and is a look of the process of integration political #european.
The round of negotiations on the world-wide trade has, therefore, an extraordinary importance and is precise that *Europa express  in said negotiations with an alone voice, so that the world-wide trade also contribute to promote the social and environmentally sustainable growth.
First, because we have taken two important reforms in the term of seven years -a big effort- and, second, because, to the contrary of the sacrifices imposed to the #european agriculturalists, the States Joined of *América have increased his subventions in 15.000 millions of dollars, in the two last years, in self-evident contradiction with the arrogant attitude *propagandística that at present adopt against the *PAC.
We ask with *usted that deploy  immediately the necessary humanitarian help to help to the *cientos of thousands of persons displaced by cause of the fights, but ask, gentleman Commissioner *Patten, that consider , in a *primer moment, a suspension of the economic help to *Rusia #if #this do not finds the alternative of resource to the negotiation and #if it continues his attacks *indiscriminados against the civil population.
Although of course we have to support the agricultural sector of the EU, as it recognises  in the report of the Mr. *Schwaiger, also have to recognise the need that the economies in development, in addition to reaching the markets, have to have access to the alimentary security so that the population have sufficient to eat.
Thus, I am very satisfied with the Report *Schwaiger because precisely it signals that, to #the same time that showed an open attitude to the world, owe *aferrarnos to it that for *nosotros has an essential value; and because this report tends, besides, a bridge among the political reality and it that *nosotros, in so much parliamentary, #can defend in front of the citizens.
We have had two important conflicts -the of the banana and the of the hormones- that the European Union has lost, and there #be had a conflict that not even *nos have brave to pose in front of the system of solution: *me refer to the #american laws *Helms-*Burton and *d' *Amato of application *extraterritorial to #european companies.
An activity *pesquera effective -#who #can argue it?- It constitutes, in spite of his reduced budgetary weight, a part no *desdeñable of a commercial politics and budgetary dynamics of the EU and has to consider  like an autonomous economic sector and a significant branch for the supply of foods.
In this sense is in the that are against of sectorial negotiations and in favour of global negotiations and are in favour that they see  the *OMC and his negotiations like an instrument for the creation of a juster society, of a more sustained development, in the that the man was sure enough the centre of #all the decisions.
The greatest States of the EU as *Francia, *Alemania and the Realm Joined had a volume of trade equivalent to roughly the 30% of his #GDP in the years sixty, in comparison with the current 60%, but then enjoyed of an economic growth much faster that now.
In *tercer place, why differ the negotiation of norms, that demands with reason our civil society and that expect the countries in roads of development to integrate the liberalisation of the exchanges and the development sustained, in fields like the health, the environment and the fundamental rights of the workers?
As they have underlined with #a lot of relevance the two speakers, this next conference has to centre in the institutional subjects, in #all the institutional subjects, with the remarkable and politically essential exception of the debates in course on a #european politics of security and defence.
#Everything *ello #can guarantee it an amendment that have presented jointly some colleagues and *yo and in the that conclude and demand that the constitutional part of the Treaty include a catalogue of competitions that define and delimit clearly the competitions of the Union and that impose the respect of the principle of subsidiariness.
As a result of different samples of opposition and of environmental considerations have blocked  the dramas of the road, and so much the national authorities like the Commission have initiated a reflection to review the strategies in relation with the different means of transport and consider the rail link like a future network *transeuropea *prioritaria.
Now well, the past 13 September restarted  the dramas in the road of the valley, in spite of which, the European Union is funding a study of feasibility of the *travesía rail and the Presidency in exercise affirms in his program that has to consider *prioritaria the reflation of the railway in *Europa.
My question, therefore, is #if they will follow forward by this disastrous path that no only affects to *Afganistán: the problem, in reality, is that the European Union continues funding the *PNUCD in the field, for example, of the programs on the hardening of the penal codes in countries like Chinese and *Birmania, countries in that the simple consumers of drugs are condemned to death and *nosotros, indirectly to *través of the *PNUCD, collaborate and fund this type of projects.
By the contrary, the Republic of *Chipre, in spite of being victim of the #turkish aggression since a 37% of his territory is occupied of illegal form by the #turkish army, do not imposes any restriction to the access to his ports of fuselages pertinent of ports situated in *Turquía.
The attacks of the police to the peaceful demonstrations, that repeated  constantly during the month of October in *Belgrado, show clearly that the fundamental values of the democracy, as they are the freedom of expression and of opinion, will not be respected in Serbian while *Milosevic and his Government remain in the power.
*Señorías, to finish want to remember that #if the experience of the application of this Agreement *Interinstitucional will suggest that #some of his looks have to go back to debate with the other Institutions, is *algo that it will be able to take in the future Today, without embargo, consider that have the duty of no *restarle value to the signature with the that have recognised our commitment to apply this Agreement *Interinstitucional.
The application of the five main indicators harmonised -demand of treatment by the *drogadictos; number of demises of *drogadictos, mortality and causes of demise among *drogadictos; incidence of illnesses *transmisibles related with the drug; *comparabilidad of the surveys on the utilisation of drugs, and behaviour and attitudes in front of the drug in the population in general, and, finally, the *comparabilidad of the estimates of the problem of the abusive use of drugs- exerts an important paper to this *respecto.
During decades, diverse governments, chosen but corrupt until the marrow -the last was the of the Mr. *Nawaz *Sharif- have allowed that in *Pakistán the rape of the human rights, the work in conditions *infrahumanas, the social catastrophe and an external debt *incontrolable are to the agenda and have destroyed the country.
These same governments have loaned his support to the diet fundamentalist of the #taliban murderers in *Afganistán and constitute a permanent and immense danger for the peace in the region, since they support and encourage the terrorist activities carried out against his #indian neighbours in the border region of *Kashmir.
Regarding the specific points that *ustedes have posed in the relative resolutions to the programs and to the projects of help to the development to *Pakistán presented by the Commission, suits to underline that #this affect almost exclusively to the poorest coats and more disadvantaged of the population.
The State, in his attempts for facilitating a juridical base for the protection and the deal of the boys, has to accept the preeminent right of the progenitors by it that refers  to the protection, the breeding and the *salvaguardia of his children.
Second, we have to demand *insistentemente to the States members that work with methods and uniform data, so that it was possible to select the best models for the fight against the drugs. We have to boost the cooperation among the police and the justice in the #european States to struggle against the traffic of drugs and protect to the youth.
Sure enough, the report of our mate is important and has to be debated carefully, among other things because the discussion of the report has put of self-evident that the politics of drugs in the European Union is #one of the most controversial subjects on the that we never have had to *pronunciarnos.
Thus I want to mention the importance that in the work, that carries out under the auspices of the Union, include like central element an informative campaign allocated to the youngsters, that today #can see induced to a large extent by mates of his same age and by other persons to test substances that *les are presented like *inofensivas, as *algo that is not more harmful that take a glass more of beer or a bit more of *güisqui.
Gentleman President, the report of the speaker, the Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, on the plan of action of the European Union in matter of fight against the drug of the Commission is a categorical document in the that the European Parliament  *opone clearly to the drugs.
In effect, treats  of a problem of today day and worrisome; we know perfectly that the drug affects to #all the countries and #all the social groups; we know also that the enlargement of *Europa to the East imposes, dramatically, the urgency of measures effective, since the control, that already results difficult, will find greater difficulties; we know that it treats  of a problem in increase.
Recently my country, the Realm Joined, has experienced an enormous increase of the arrival of persons; in my previous place of work like doctor in the Central Hospital of *Londres, #can observe that there was an important grade of illegal immigration and of fraudulent abuse of our generous politics of asylum.
*Me Said the Mr. #Martí, #one of his vice-presidents, that the *BEI is property of the States members and that, therefore, according to the Treaty is not an institution of the European Union that have the obligation to answer to the European Parliament, to the Court of Accounts or to *OLAF.
Anyway, the debate *me has seemed of big interest and expect that it that today have heard here was not an obstacle, without embargo, so that we #can follow forward in the approval of the distribution of resources, of the distribution of loans, from the next year and that do not delay  the community procedures.
After examining the *APIM/*Arbitrio on production and and imports of the Archipelago, the Commission concluded that although the majority of the economic sectors #can adapt to the requirements of the only market, the disappearance of the *APIM on 31 December of the year 2000 #can affect *irremediablemente to some sectors of production.
This situation and these proposals involve a worrisome aging of the fleet *pesquera #european, deter to the youngsters to invest, cause an important loss of market for the sector of the skilled dockyards, weakening dangerously to #some of *ellos, and take to run an evident risk in matter of security to our sailors shipped.
The valid directive in matter of naval construction contains #all class of muddy regulations of help regarding the investigation and the development, the environment, the innovation and the politics of support regional, with the consequence that it punishes  to the fine dockyards and rewards  to the bad.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, is an absolutely extraordinary fact that in the meeting of the Council of Industry of the last week approved  by unanimity the list of measures to delete the situation of competition disloyal created by the Republic of *Corea.
The Europeans were the that open the world through the navigation: the Scandinavians in the north, the #portuguese and Spaniards to *América, *África and #Asia, the Dutches, the #danish, the English, the French have sailed #all the waters with ships taken in our earths and our dockyards.
By it other, is impossible *evitarlas, but are talking of a political question very delicate and in this sense is important that the Commission and the Council know that in this Parliament exists a big consensus in relation with this subject and a big worry on the need that we find a solution for the problem.
*Permítame *pedirle That transmit to #all the political leaders of *Irlanda of the North and as we #be to say in *Irlanda "of the another side of the puddle" , to the #british Prime minister and to #all his colleagues, and also to the *taoiseach #irish *Bertie *Ahern and to his predecessors, the predecessors of both parts, our sincere gratitude by it that *nos have helped to achieve.
Besides, this agency has to occupy, of course, to establish the list of the products forbidden, watch the laboratories, elaborate systems of control, establish controls out of the competitions, exert the repression, is to say, struggle against the mafias that devote  to the trade of the products forbidden, but also of the prevention so that the youngsters  *disocien psychological and actively of the *flagelo of the doping.
My question is the following: it understands the Commission that the politics that has to develop in relation with the sport, and especially with the concentration to be able to that it generates  in relation with the audiovisual means, has to conduct to a conjoint action among his station and the that occupies  of the defence of the competition?
*Yo *le #Would ask to the Parliament that intensify his efforts for *presionar in this sense and procure to influence of cooperative way and *convincente on the Government, so as to that the sport obtain a foundation in the Treaty, specifically -which #would be very desirable, since it also #would go oriented in the sense of the subsidiariness- in #the same terms that the culture.
Some that talk of dates of adhesion seems difficult, although it #would be useful, extraordinarily useful, to boost to the public opinion of the countries affected, since it is increasingly evident a risk: some too much long negotiations #can cool the enthusiasm so much in the States members as in the countries candidates, as it remained patent in the recent polls made in *Polonia and as I #can check personally in this country, of the *cual returned yesterday.
I believe that we have to examine this question much more thoroughly for *presionar to the countries that have a shameful behaviour; we have to call the attention to the governments known like "*arrancadores of nails" , and the European Parliament has to be the institution that take the initiative to guarantee that the human rights appear among our main priorities.
But *déjenme say, to the thread of it that have said the two orators that *me have preceded in the use of the word -with those who do not agree-, that the fact that *Europa, and in particular the European Union, take of the human rights his flag, really his only flag, has this greatness.
Gentleman President, this report of the Council deserves our respect and there #be #all type of reasons to congratulate to the #finnish Presidency by his stake. Although I have to say that I regret a lot that the delegation of the Presidency in exercise finish to abandon the hall.
With the right to the life like central reason, the EU has to continue in his consistent line against of the pity of death and, through Nations Joined, has to challenge to the countries that consider ethical and morally *defendible the right of the state to remove the life to the persons.
This evaluation has to analyse the situation of the human rights, pronounce on the available measures to improve the situation, review the effect that exert these measures in the situation and take estimates on the result of #the same, #as well as publish reports on the assessments made and the results obtained.
It is hour to make the idea of the European Parliament on the creation, in the breast of the Commission, of an organ of control on the politics in matter of human rights that facilitated the execution of said political and informed on subjects related with the human rights.
In the *primer case, treats  of the finance in the three next years of a total of 135 millions of euros in virtue of the article 130 of the Treaty of the European Community and that requires the application of a procedure of *codecisión, whereas in the second, that establishes for #the same period the commitment of 15 millions of euros, will be able to be object of a simple procedure of query.
In his intervention in front of this Assembly on 13 October, the Mr. *Prodi suggested that an association for the similar adhesion to the associations established with the countries official candidates also #would contribute to that *Turquía advance with greater firmness to the fulfillment of the criteria of adhesion.
The majority of this Parliament yes has taken it after heavy debates, since the acceptance #would suppose a stimulus so that the #turkish Government reach an acceptable politics of human rights, a true democratisation and a political solution for the problem *kurdo.
*Yo Believe that the report is very important because with *él the European Parliament adheres  to the idea that the #european strategy constitutes a half adapted to expand the relations among the European Union and *Turquía, and that the application of said strategy requires a financial support.
To my mood to see, the true political priority is that they respect  the values limit in #all the zones, also in the of the called "hot points" and is precise to avert that some norms of exception wide open the door to that they do not move  the values applicable limit to the *benceno.
It do not treats , *Señorías, of *infundir fear, but is necessary -create *yo- take consciousness and take that it take  consciousness of the dangers that run, #if we do not adopt now realistic measures and necessarily severe that present the less possible exceptions to evaluate, control and limit to the minimum the broadcasts *contaminantes of these two harmful gases, so much more what that #this are more dangerous for the boys, the persons of age and #all those that suffer cardiac or pulmonary conditions.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0072/1999) of the Mr. *Pesälä, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the commercialisation of the forest materials of reproduction (*COM(1999) 188 - *C5-0128/1999 - 1999/0092(*CNS)).
*Yo Wanted to remember today the enormous catastrophe of the avalanche of takes a year in *Galtür, since #this shows *cuán important is the care of the nature, that has to be a worry of #all, and also that the alpine territory is precisely a very vulnerable zone, as they see  forced to ascertain repeatedly the connoisseurs of the region.
I do not go to repeat it that already has mentioned the respectable speaker on the concrete form in that we have to tackle the transitory period of the national coins to the euro. Yes I want to take two observations in the context of his report.
*Me Pleases to signal that the scientific committees, technician and economic supported the proposal, after examining the report of the committee adviser of the management of the *pesquerías during his session of November of 1999, in addition to the specific provisions on the use of networks of siege of *jareta #danish in the bank of *platijas.
Lady Speaker, want to congratulate also to the Mr. *Gallagher by his excellent work and want to say here that carry two years arguing long and tended about the community market of the fishing and that, at last, today *le corresponds to the Plenary of this Parliament fix his posture with this report that has been -and it is necessary to say it- approved by wide majority in the Commission of Fishing.
They have to know that from yesterday #all the ports *pesqueros of the #mediterranean seaboard are in strike, because the fishermen protest against the price of the diesel and the collapse of the prices of the #blue fish, of the tuna, of the sardine and also of the eels, that no longer sell .
The own European Commission has seen  forced to recognise that, from the application of the Union *aduanera, "in *Turquía has not made  any significant progress in the field of the human rights and of the democratic reform".
A village, a nation, #one *Europa that by a badly understood correction do not conserve his own culture runs the risk to disappear, by it that ask to my colleagues that undo  of the leaf with the text of the EU and use the beautiful cards *UNICEF #such as they are.
*Nosotros Also had a real house #whose sins are much more hovers of the current period, and wanted to declare, at least like spokesman of the Socialist Party *Panhelénico, that bear *nosotros is of the all inadmissible debate this type of things, because #this is to take part in questions very delicate, that have to debate in our country before getting to the #european field.
And it costs the pity reaffirm that, regarding the content, follow struggling by the questions of the environment, the protection of the consumers, the social rights, the human rights, the cultural diversity and the paper *multifuncional of the agriculture.
The truth is that the agreement in perspective was very bad for the agriculture, as *nos left in the point of game in a position weakened to negotiate in the future, but at the end are, more that never, in conditions to have an offensive posture in this new Round.
It treats  here of a juridical act that pursues it following: a coherent and durable system of measures of surveillance of #all the parts *contratantes in the areas mentioned: the experiences of the commissions of fishing of the Atlantic northeastern and of the Atlantic *noroccidental have to be moved to the community right of the EU.
This report on the verification of *credenciales brings cause and has his juridical foundation in the article 11 of the relative Record to the election of the representatives in the European Parliament *aneja to the decision of the Council of 20 September 1976.
The artistic style, in the attempt to reach a commitment, results the majority of the times in a defeat to the hour to legislate, with which of this principle the discussion no longer #can  centre in talking simple and clearly.
By #another, *carecemos of definite and complete statistics on the current flow of transport of commodities among Swiss and the European Union although this study is next to finalise, foreseeing in #the same regulation that in the year 2000 #can modify the current figures of distribution in the case that the real data divert  significantly of the that now they foresee .
And, without embargo, the only opportunity of employment that has offered  in *Derry up to now with the process of peace in course has been the of *Raytheon, the third company in importance of manufacture of arms of the #EE.UU. So that I consider a contradiction in the terms talk of a process of peace and facilitate places of work in the industry of armaments for persons that have been decimated by the violence.
It is precise to endow to the European Union of a politics *auténticamente democratic, oriented in favour of the human rights, that the convert in a factor of stability, in a factor in favour of the peace, of the development, of the human rights and of the democracy in *Europa in the century *XXI.
Of course, it #would be extraordinarily difficult and unfeasible request the support of the #european public to introduce the unanimity for the changes in matter of fiscal harmonisation or for relative decisions to the questions of politics external and security in the level of the European Council.
Also it has conceded  to *Turquía the condition of candidate for the adhesion to the EU, although it will have to fulfil the political criteria established for the future adhesion, among *ellos the show, of course, that the respect of the human rights is intrinsic part of the #turkish life.
The world is in roads to have a new *superestado at the side of the #EE.UU. Well it is truth that has approved  that the community army is not a community army because it do not has permanent existence; but in this case, neither exists a *Eurocuerpo or some strengths armed of the NATO.
They have achieved  great progresses in the field of the external politics and of security, but *yo throw in fault #one, to know, some authentic links so much of the High Representative as of the Commission and the Commissioner of Subjects External to the structures *decisorias of the direction of the organs.
As it finishes to expose the Mrs. *Siimes, exists an agreement among the Council and the Parliament on the possibility to devote the whole of the reservation of flexibility to the finance of the costs of the help to *Kosovo.
It achieved  reach an agreement to include in the Budget of the year 2000 other 300 millions, in addition to the 60 pertinent millions of the transfer of remainders of this year, and consider like part of the commitment for the year 2001 the 140 committed millions in the conference of donors.
In the document of the Commission on strategic questions approved on 10 December concluded  that they did not have to  subcontract the fundamental tasks in matter of public services and that the Commission had to have to his disposal a much more flexible group of relative disposals to tasks no fundamental in matter of public services.
I said literally that, in these moments, the Council did not considers necessary the permanent review of the bunches of the project of budgets for the exercise 2000, and have offered the application of the instrument of flexibility for the category 4.
Although it corresponds to the Bosses of State or of Government decide the definite statute of the Letter, the organ will have to examine in his proposal how combine the two pending questions: a text *jurídicamente *vinculante and smart to be included in the Treaty or a solemn political statement.
Like logical consequence of this circumstance, the masses of ice blocked #can elevate to a large extent the level of the waters of the *Danubio, it that it #can give place to floods truly dramatic. To his time, the floods #would elevate the costs of the reconstruction, it that #would not correspond  in mood #any with the interests of the Commission.
In his report on the application of the Regulation 1475/95 relative to the distribution of cars, that is foreseen for the end of the year 2000, the Commission will evaluate the repercussions of the system of distribution *exento in the prices of the cars.
The differences in the taxation of the different types of cars are, of course, a factor, but *eso *nos poses the question of the ease or the difficulty that *reviste for the European Union the adoption of any relative decision to the fiscal subjects.
I do not say it so much by me -*yo have time-, but by a consideration that to #a lot of and #a lot of colleagues, especially to the recently got,  *les escapes: in the development of a session *plenaria like #this do not take part only the that *nos find here in front and the and the interpreters that #can see in his cabins, but that behind have a gigantic device, that occupies , for example, that *ustedes #can have tomorrow early of the literal Record of the session.
In a modern economic system, #this are the vertebral column of the economy. By #this, *yo propose in an amendment that the investments do not limit  to a maximum of the 25 % of the total volume, but that adapt  to the capacity of absorption of the country *beneficiario.
Without embargo, have to remember that the security in the European Parliament is object of debate from takes long. Therefore, maybe it #would not be of more that created  a group of work that likewise informed to the deputies of the existent possibilities in the European Parliament to guarantee the security of his members.
In the SAW Conference will have to take a decision on the mood to guarantee the environmental correction like part of the global package of decisions, and the position of the relative Community to the subject of the maximum limits has not changed.
And *cuando say "to convince to his partners", treats  perhaps first of all to convince to the own countries of the European Union, because *Europa talks, but the fifteen States members of the European Union are had to make the necessary efforts and to respect, to apply, the numerous directives that vote here, in this hemicycle?
This question has, from the point of sight of the Union, two fundamental looks, and the first of *ellos is the performance of the European Union to reduce his own broadcasts, look that is key also for the international credibility of the European Union.
I agree with #a lot of things that have said  here on the value of the integration of the environmental looks in #all the sector of the transports and in the politics of transports In the Commission have given #some first important steps, but still remains a lot for taking.
As it has signalled the last orator, Mr. *Gollnisch, is true that *Macao represents a free society: a free city in the extreme of Chinese, in the extreme of #Asia, as it signalled the Mr. *Graça *Moura to the start of our debate; an extraordinary crossing go in Orient and Occident from the century *XVI.
*Hong *Kong And *Macao are two great international cities; they #can exert a very important paper in the continuation of the development and in the opening with hit of Chinese to the rest of the world; and in the exert of this paper, *Macao will have our best wishes for the thrilling period of the history that am safe *les offers the future.
(*FR) Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, as I informed to the with regard to the Commission *INDU on 6 December past, *cuando attended to present the conclusions of the Council "Investigation" of 2 December, the ministers gave his agreement to a new complementary program 2003 regarding the reactor of high flow of *Petten, situated in the Low Countries.
(*FR) Have to express my satisfaction when seeing that, finally, have gone out of the stagnation in the that were the discussions among the European Parliament and the relative Council to the program *Socrates *II, since the Parliament has known to show very firm in his position during this long procedure of conciliation.
The Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance have refused the proposal to diminish the number of permissions to distribute among the States members, as it had posed  by the Group of the Popular Party European.
The future enlargement of *Europa, confirmed by the conclusions of *Helsinki, poses the question of the respect, by the countries candidates, of the criteria of construction of the equality of sexes, #as well as of the criteria of promotion of the freedom of the women.
It has to answer in front of the #european courts, and the procedure has to be by the fast road to guarantee that they pay  compensations to the sector of the *vacuno #british, no only by the loss of the trade with *Francia, but also by the loss of our trade all over the world, like consequence of the damage *ocasionado to the reputation of our products of high quality.
In principle, the four important debates on the politics of competition -four reports related among himself/hisself- were foreseen for the morning of the Wednesday, but have remained postponed until the afternoon and afterwards until the night. By #everything *ello, urge to the Presidency to that it consider the possibility to celebrate said debates the Tuesday of the partial period of sessions of January.
By a part, has insisted  *metódicamente in that the States members have to adapt his legislations to the rule of the EU in matter of asylum, immigration and control of borders, #as well as to the stipulations of *Schengen, that have happened to form part of the rule of the European Union through the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Like this as, the European Bank of Investments  *atiene to this rule regarding the documents and to his publication, #if well the goal has to be, in general, the extension of the principle of access to the information and of transparency in the measure that do not put  in danger the commercial secret.
We have not protested neither *nos have denied, have put hands to the drama and have worked. In this context wanted to give the thanks to the speaker, the Mr. *Papayannakis, to the Mr. *Kindermann, speaker of the Commission of Agriculture, and also to the administration and to the juridical service.
The second point on the that wished to call his attention, before beginning the year 2000, is the following: we do not expect until November, as we have taken this year, to put on the table the definite regulation, that has to allow an immediate application, as it establishes it, on the other hand, the excellent report of the Mr. *Papayannakis.
The protocol on the protection and the welfare of the animals, *anejo to the Treaty by the that it creates  the European Community, asks to the Community and to the States members that, when formulating and apply his agricultural politics, have fully in account the requirements in matter of health and welfare of the animals.
Only I want *asociarme to the words of the previous speakers and remember a political norm: that the prudence no *nos goes to take never treacherous, and therefore I appreciate enormously the solidarity and firmness of the Commission of Budgets, that *nos has allowed to save the interests of the Parliament like institution.
In the last term of office have voted repeated times against the budgets because, in spite of the reports on the worrisome situation of the apiculture in *Europa, approved by unanimity the Commission has denied  to put to disposal the credits for the measures of conservation of the apiculture that had demanded.
In consequence, want that the relations with this important partner do not base  in the *ilusoria perspective to obtain the condition of member, but in the narrowest collaboration in an economic frame by means of the fulfillment of the derivative obligations of the Agreement of Union *Aduanera.
The most important result of the summit was the ratification by part of the EU of the ambitious plans on the enlargement of the EU, it that involves, among other things, the announcement now of a governmental conference that take possible this admission of new States members.
Here it includes  the help to #Sierra Lion, to the refugees in the neighbouring countries of #Liberia and *Guinea and, as already it has commented  here, the help for the *ORN, the psychosocial help in the camps of displaced, that have initiated programs of help for the boys soldered *desmovilizados and that tackle the frightful problem of the boys mutilated for *ofrecerles #any perspective of life.
Gentleman President, in the twilight of the century *XX, of a century that has been positively signalled by the peaceful revolution of the women, is really regrettable that there #be still countries like *Kuwait and *Afganistán, in the that the half of the population, the women, is deprived even of the fundamental rights.
A resolution of this nature on a Been member of the European Union #would have more felt that on a *tercer country, but #would constitute, even in this case, an attack to the operation of the institutions of this State and to the capacity of his citizens to resolve internally this problem.
We #can not *comprometernos during decades to the support to the producers of the most favoured regions of *Europa by descents of the prices occurred sometimes in the happened The solution #would consist in harmonising the helps by hectares of the most egalitarian form possible for #all the space of the EU.
His antecedent is the Decision 96/411/*CE of the relative Council to the improvement of the community agricultural statistics, that has put to disposal of the Commission a flexible tool that *le allows to adapt the statistical applications to the distinct needs of information to measure that go  producing changes.
Obviously, the *lúpulo is not the typical example to appreciate the importance that has the Common Agricultural Politics for the agriculturalists of the European Union, but shows his depth and his extension in the assistance to our agriculturalists.
Now well, to #the same time multiply  the financial helps, exceptional calls, to the most diverse countries of the planet, without that  *propicie any plan of group, so that our politics of cooperation only is #one wanders and immense dispersion, is to say, in sum, that no longer is a politics.
I believe that the proposals of the Mr. *Herman go very oriented, always that our successors have the political will to finish with this *rotatividad *paralizadora among the two great Groups and are able to take place for the political debate, is to say, for the voice of the citizens of the European Union.
In spite of the improvements that have introduced  in the legislation, especially the relative to the born boys from 1992, seems that the political class leader in *Estonia is contributing to keep a notion -in my conservative- opinion regarding the question of the citizenship.
Sometimes it is not easy *explicarles that a juridical culture really applied in the practice of the justice and of the Courts is precisely previous condition for an inner market that work, of #the same mood that a democracy is of course previous condition for the political Union.
I want to begin for underlining once again, and am talking by #all #that that inside the Commission are commissioned of the preparation for the enlargement, that are deeply conscious of the historical and only opportunity that has the European Union to bring the peace and stability to a greater part of this continent.
In the next autumn, the Commission will elaborate more reports on the progresses, but also is our intention make in October of the present year, is to say still before the summit of *Helsinki, an adaptation, or say better a readjustment, of the associations for the adhesion that *usted knows, in function of the progresses and developments ascertained in this moment.
#Some sectors that have his own specific rules that have shown his validity in the practice, as, especially, the agreements of distribution of beer, are working satisfactorily for the hospitality industry, for the great and small breweries, for the wholesalers and for the consumers.
With an assessment of the effects of the vertical agreements #can register better the situation in the inner market that with strict formal criteria. #This is like this besides since then the small participants in the market #would benefit  of the simplifications of the formal requests.
They #can not  fix thresholds in a small country like the #mine, in the that maybe there #be #one *cervecera dominant, but in a very limited market, whereas #one *cervecera like the «*Bitburger», contiguous to *nosotros, that has a much stronger position and a volume of businesses much more important no this considered dominant, because *Alemania is enormous concerning the Big Duchy of *Luxemburgo.
Also I give thanks to the President of the Commission of Requests, Mr. *Fontana, and to #all the members of the parliamentary commission by his positive attitude in his contacts with the office of the Defender of the European Village.
Likewise, I consider fundamental for the work of the Defender of the Village -and like this signal it in the report- the modification of his statute to achieve that the access of the Defender to #all the notable documents in the procedures that *él follows produce  it more effectively possible.
Regarding the performance of the office of the Defender of the Village in matter of information and communication, believe that said performance is a good example for other #european institutions, especially regarding the utilisation of the new technologies of the communication, as, for example, the approach of the citizenship to this institution through Internet.
It is very important that examine  in detail the Statute of the civil servants and that introduce  the necessary modifications to establish directly the obligation to the civil servants to signal the irregularities that #can perceive in the exert of his functions about the operation of the community organs.
The Commission, nevertheless, had the intention to convert said code in #one of the three axes of a more ambitious reform of the group of his internal and external performances that, without embargo, has not been able to get still to good end by the reasons that the Parliament knows perfectly.
Regarding the modification of the Statute of the Defender of the Village, with regard to this point or to the of the testimonies of the civil servants, obviously *le corresponds to the Plenary take the initiative in accordance with the article 138 And. Afterwards it will be task of the Commission -of the next Commission, obviously- issue his *dictamen to the *respecto.
These relative problems to the computer system were very present in the relative report to the approval of the management of 1996, that finally conducted to the fall of the Commission. From then, the European Commission has taken table *rasa.
We do not owe *sentarnos to expect the compatibility that have detailed in a document of work for the Commission of Transports, since before #this *suceda, will have happened ten years and *eso #can use like excuse to reckon the real costs by the use of the roads.
Gentleman President, like member of the Greens and fervent adherent of the resolution of commitment that have approved in this Parliament, wanted to express my respect to #all the collaborators of the NATO that in this moment are working in defence of the human rights in the neighbouring countries of *Kosovo.
As it knows the Parliament, the Commission adopted in the year 1997 a recommendation in this matter and is examining his application; it #would be, therefore, premature that engaged  from this time on to adopt a proposal of directive, since it will not be able to value adequately the situation until it do not conclude the examination in course.
The Bosses of State and of Government gave a political impulse to said process in the Summits of *Cardiff and of *Viena, impulse that has to end, in the Summit of Colony, in a report on the necessary measures for the realisation of an only financial market.
I know that the authorities of the valley of *Chamonix have reported in #a lot of occasions the step of thousands of trucks by this narrow valley and by this tunnel, that, obviously, had not built  for a so important traffic.
Of this drama, that #would have been able to  avert, have to take out the consequences and exert pressures no only in front of *usted, gentleman Commissioner, but also in front of the Council, so that at last it develop  a true political «railway-road» in the sector of the transports of commodities, and *ello so much for the difficult zones as for the group of the national territory.
Said #this, gentleman President, wished to signal, in name of my Group, that will not vote in favour of the four amendments presented on this resolution, no because we refuse the bottom or because we do not share the worries that express, but because we consider that perhaps this Parliament will have the occasion, in another moment, to go back to manifest, as a whole, his opinion on these problems.
It is regrettable that in #a lot of places of the world, and also in *Irlanda of North, the lawyers and the judges have found  in first line, #where the conflicts are more intense. The murder of *Rosemary #Nelson *nos shows once again the danger that #many of these professionals run *cuando defend the human rights more fundamental of his customers.
The call in favour of an independent inquiry has to  to the fact that it has  the conviction that an inquiry of the #irish police on the death of the Mrs. #Nelson #would not be all it rigorous that it #would have to be, as all indicates that the Mrs. #Nelson feared by his own life and that during long considered  in situation of grave danger.
It #can not  deny the implication of the heavy vehicles in the mortal accidents, since, in addition to some conditions of work too much difficult, the weight is also an aggravating factor, by what often is associated to an excessive speed.
In this debate on the loyal competition have to be conscious that in the field of the railway the wages are higher and the places of work occupy  usually for life. It More #likely is that in the sector deprived these conditions do not get  to give never.
It #can not give credit to my hearings *cuando #one of the experts invited to the celebrated audience with reason of the White Book signalled that by environmental reasons it was necessary to tax the fuel for the aviation with 4 *ecus the litre. Rates of *Concorde in the daily life, #who the goes to pay?
Lady Speaker, first of all, wanted to congratulate to the Mrs. *Bennasar *Tous, although absent, and also to the Mrs. #Colombo *Svevo that so *dignamente *nos has presented the subject this morning; but especially, it wanted to congratulate to the Mrs. speaker by his valuable contribution to the proposal of the Commission on the program *DAPHNE, #as well as by the form in that it has treated a so important question.
*Nosotros Support the request that, in the Consultative Committee, there #be a representative of the European Parliament and a representative of the *ONG, #as well as the request that it present  a report on the progresses made a time to the year, and no each three years.
Lady Speaker, the Commission wishes to give thanks to the Mrs. *Bennasar *Tous and to the Commission of Rights of the Woman by the report prepared, that supports firmly the initiative of the Commission and underlines in admirable form the need and the urgency that it adopt  the program *DAPHNE with sufficient *antelación at the end of the year.
In my report, that had been approved by the Commission of Transports and Tourism without that the point 1 suffered modification #any, asked that it introduced  a system of rates uniform for #all the vehicles of transport «and that had in the social costs limit #one of his foundations».
Had account that the Council has approved the regulation that collects the relative general norms to the structural Bottoms, each #one of the States members has to propose to the Commission #which are the regions that gather the conditions established in said regulation and that, in opinion of the States, find  in a situation more *desfavorable.
#Many of the that here we are have been witnesses of his important action in the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects of this Parliament, that was not but a demonstration more of his constant dedication to the social and #sindical subjects that *le brought to this Assembly.
Certainly, the regulation of the privileges and immunities -that dates of the year 1965- traces back to a moment in that this Parliament was a mere parliamentary assembly in #where, still, his grade of representativeness of a #european citizenship was in the realm of the utopia.
Today we have the euro, today is indisputable that his proposals are hit and that the report of our colleague, the Mr. *Menrad, that occupies  of the dimension of the politics of employment is also a very good report that it #can be argued here with the Report *Fourçans.
The solutions for the elimination of the chronic unemployment in *Europa are not in a #european program of employment neither in an economic politics, *homogéneamente configured, of the States members of the Economic European Union and Monetary, but in the structural reforms.
Only there #be a point, the relative to the structural reforms, on the that it wanted to call the attention, for *precisarles that the Commission is had to value the liberalisation of the sectors of the telecommunications, the transports and the energy.
Gentleman President, distinguished colleagues of the European Parliament. As *ustedes know, on 19 April had already the opportunity to expose to his Commission of Control Budgetary the position of the Council in the procedure of approval of the management for 1997.
I see that already they have applied  adequately the diverse relative disposals to the staff and have understood that, of #all the staff of the Centre, only remain vacancies two places of the category To. I do not hesitate it more minimum in recommending the approval of the management also for the *CEDEFOP.
I am surprised to see that the Socialist Group has presented an amendment so that it delete  the point 1 of the Report *Elles, that is the important, is to say, in the that remember our final decision of not approving the management of the Commission of the year 1996.
But there #be had a problem, #can recognise that, *cuando have adopted in the political level clear decisions and oriented in the correct direction, the capacity of the Commission to apply the decisions in #all his services of #the same form has been mentally handicapped person.
From here, there #be another important principle that to *nosotros *nos links and that also has to see with this responsibility bear with the citizens of the that talked before: it is the principle of conservation of the acts, the principle to be it more effective possible and give the fastest and better answer to the citizens.
Sure enough, have now precisely #this: any emotion, but the scientific demonstration -and precisely as it has demanded , the qualitative security, no the quantitative- that the utilisation of hormones is harmful, that represents a threat for the health, that is *cancerígena, that causes the early apparition of the puberty of the girls. I translate it that is written here.
And of here also that *yo defend the creation of a bottom of compensation for the companies that see  affected by #such sanctions, since, of it contrary, #many of *ellas #can see  immersed in a deep crisis that #can *llevarlas to the disappearance, with the consequent loss of places of work precisely in some moments in that we are promoting -want to promote from the Union- some politics in benefit of the occupation.
#If the Commission yields the evaluation and the capacity of initiative for new proposals as it occurs in this proposal, then is undermining really his right of existence and is destroying in fact it that it is a principle determinant in the Union, and east is the right of initiative.
Thanks to the community spirit have been possible in *Europa the State of right, the dialogue, the democratic institutions, the recognition of the minorities, and with this spirit #can put end also to a conflict that carries *martirizando to the villages of the *sudeste #european from takes more of ten years.
The Greens expect of *usted, gentleman *Prodi, regarding this Parliament, that engage  in the Conference *Intergubernamental to bet firmly for strengthening this House until it was a Parliament of plenary right, with full powers of *codecisión legislative also in matter of agriculture and of compulsory costs, and with right plenaries of control of the application of the politics.
This cure of *adelgazamiento has to make before the nomination of the new Commission, by it that exist #a lot of general reasons to postpone the approval of the Mr. *Prodi, without embargo, my group also has a political reason: The Mr. *Prodi wishes the States Joined of *Europa.
In #some moments, the problem of the balance among these two looks has found #any solution; for example, the Mr. *Delors treated to *través of the White Book to take a synthesis and to find a point of balance, looked for the balance among these two looks.
*Europa Has not set up still the cell of #analysis for the active politics of prevention of the conflicts -like European Parliament approve a proposal of this type- has to recover the dignity, the ambition and the responsibility of an initiative.
We think that it is necessary to restore a true monetary flexibility and adapt the euro to the specific situations of the different countries leaving *subsistir, on 1 January 2002, the national coins in front of the euro, that #would convert  like this in a simple common coin.
*Confrontados To the new challenges engendered, in particular, by the fall of the Wall of *Berlín and the *mundialización of the economy, so much #one like #another never have doubted in increasing the charge of work of the Commission, although without taking out #all the logical consequences, especially in matter of contracting of personnel.
It fits to expect, therefore, that the Foundation will engage  to answer of the so positive way that seems to indicate our speaker to the pending questions or that finish to be posed with occasion of the examination of the procedure of approval of the management in the exercise 1997: costs of mission and agreements of study.
Gentleman President, have received of the office of the President of the Parliament a letter that *me says that my question directed to the Council, that had to debate tomorrow, will not debate  then because today it #would take place the debate on *Kosovo and in *él #would include  also my question, that refers  to the question of the environment in *Kosovo, that has been *auténticamente destroyed.
We loan, instead, attention to the #european voices each more numerous day, stronger and more significant, of *Oskar *Lafontaine to the 180 #italian deputies of the democrat majority of left, #christian democrats, that, in name of #one some vision of *Europa, ask, to the equal that take *nosotros, the end of the bombardments.
We are practical in the short term: support the initiative of *Chernomirdin, *salvaguardar *Montenegro of the bombardments in the measure of it possible, keep the demographic balance in *Macedonia with the received of #kosovar refugees in the EU, so that it #can not produce another climbing of the conflict in the region and, gentleman President, contain the transport of arms for the *UCK as it has taken #Italia.
We have to begin to explain to the Mrs. *Harbour -and is the Council the one who has to take it- that #if *Hitler had not been accused because it #can not  test #who were the bosses of the distinct fields of extermination, #would not have been able to  show the chain of control existent among *Berlín and *Auschwitz.
It That it has to occur it is that, *eventualmente with the agreement of peace of the that talked right now the Mr. Minister, in the *Balcanes define  the conditions to establish the State of right and the democracy, the eradication of #all the sources of aggression that in this instant exist, especially in the diet of *Milosevic.
The situation is extremely difficult and only the intervention armed -#if before *Milosevic do not yields with regard to the conditions imposed by the NATO and the European Union- #can give a break and create a cord of protection with seen to this space of peace and security of the that have talked.
In the next days, will go back to go to the region, without embargo, *les pray that *nos help to transmit this message: for the time being, the fundamental element of the humanitarian help are the elections *prioritarias, the discipline and the coordination, of it contrary fear that also the big generosity of #all finish in a big confusion.
I recommend to this Assembly and to the President in exercise the initiative of His Holiness the *Patriarca of *Constantinopla to organise the religious symposium, scientist and environmental that will celebrate  in September and in the that representatives of the five great religions of the #orthodox -and #catholic region, #protestant, #jewish and #muslim- will sail from *Ratisbona until the #Black sea in *pro of the environment and of the reconciliation.
The position expressed this morning by the Mr. *Prodi and what *nos has said now the President in exercise of the Council on the importance that for the hit of the great political of the Union, like the enlargement and the *PESC, will earn the Russian Federation in the immediate future *nos fill of hope.
This common strategy proposes the democracy, the State of right of the public institutions, the integration of *Rusia in an economic and social space European and the imperative common that confronts the #european continent.
In this sense, is particularly important that leave clear in front of the Council that the procedure of approval of a report with recommendations to the Council on a common strategy constitutes an exceptional solution, motivated by the particular circumstances of an electoral year.
The efforts of *Rusia to reach a solution of the conflict of the *Balcanes do not take more that highlight once again the importance of said country for the #european architecture of the security and, in consequence, *yo back explicitly the wishes of the President of the Council that it adopt  it before possible this strategy.
The text of the section 5 of the article 190 of the Treaty says that «the Parliament will establish the statute and the general conditions of exercise of the functions of his members, previous *dictamen of the Commission and with the approval by unanimity of the Council».
*Yo Believe that the Council -and the Governments- have shown his fine will regarding the Parliament, in the first place accessing to *algo that *nosotros believed that it was very difficult, that is the inclusion in the Treaty of *Amsterdam of this article precisely, that ask from the Parliament and that #all believed that the Council -or the Governments- did not go to accept.
I expect that they #can increase  of systematic way in the properly said budget the resources of the Defender of the Village, since #this will be the best way to boost the confidence of the citizens in the general activities of the EU.
The Mrs. *González *Álvarez mentioned the question of the comments of the Commission of Budgets relative to the part of costs administrative inside the budget of exploitation global and made #some observations very wise to the *respecto.
In the meantime, the European Parliament, our Parliament, has gone  developing until converting  in a political institution inside the European Union that already is *ineludible and that has exerted his faculty of control political and budgetary vigorously and with big independence.
With regard to the Parliament, wanted to say also that the characteristic note of this term of office is that we have left the short trousers -am talking from my masculine condition, and therefore I put this example of the short trousers, of course, without going in in any example *sexista-.
But above #everything *eso, recognise that it is *usted a man of firm convictions, that has #a lot of natural human qualities; a person of big energy and determination and a person that always has shown  positive and *ecuánime; a person *alentadora and also a person that #can be very firm and authoritarian *cuando it is necessary to show this type of authority, as we have witnessed in #some occasions.
The pact has to be expression of an active politics of labour market that bet more that up to now by the avoidance of the unemployment, is to say, especially, by the reduction of the juvenile unemployment and of long length #as well as by the ending of the discrimination of the women in the labour market.
The events occurred at the beginning of this year and that have conducted to the resignation of the Commission and to a debate on his reform, are reason to examine in this context also the relation among the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.
Any delay in the reinforcement of the institutions and of his operation only #can engage the effective enlargement of the Union; this new reform has to prepare to the institutions for the enlargement, but has to allow also answer to #some failures of institutional operation that have appeared in the last months.
Of course, we do not put in cloth of trial #some fundamental looks like the article *N, but that say that in the preparatory stage are necessary some novelties because we have checked the deficiencies of the method *intergubernamental and, therefore, the need to prepare of another form the result of the Conference *Intergubernamental.
The quantity of States that in this moment request the entry in the European Union #would suppose a change -in the case that they went admitted in the qualitative current-conditions in the structure of the European Union.
In his intervention of yesterday *le hear to talk of his political responsibility, of the capacity of direction political of the School, of his function of orientation political, of the need that it adopt a big political initiative.
After the European Summit of Colony, opt once and for all by a *Europa #where #all the legislation and #all the budget situate  definitively under the supervision of the European Parliament and in the that the European Commission was forced to offer a maximum transparency with a free management of #all fraud.
Among the central elements of the package of reform includes  the enlargement of the politics for the development of the rural area, included a better impulse to the compatible economic methods with the environment.
Thus, it has not been surprising that before the summit of Colony of #one or another spot have come from critical to the strategy of the Presidency or to the mood to carry the negotiations, but after the summit of *Berlín the assessment is totally different.
I expect that it concretise  the political will affirmed by *Prodi to recover the institutional balance to end to allow that the Commission go back to exert his indispensable paper of political impulse, like independent organ of the national governments and of the private interests.
Lady Speaker, in the plane of the procedure, wanted to signal to the Mr. *Cox and to the Mrs. *Green, although they have gone , that *yo presented, on 13 December, an amendment of #the same type that the global amendments, that already have debated  amply, and that this amendment in his moment - perhaps because it was #mine -, was declared inadmissible.
But, how it occurs with the future?The reform allows to answer to the tracks for a durable agriculture presented by the Commission, in contradiction with the proposal modified of the agricultural section of Diary 2000?&#*x017*C;it has reinforced  the cooperation among the European Union and the countries *ACP?
Second -and very linked to the ordination of the territory-, #ours *segunda amends of transaction asks that the *FEDER contribute to establish the necessary links among the regions that geographically suffer permanent disadvantages by his *alejamiento, peripheral character or *insularidad, to boost the exchanges among the periphery of *Europa and the central regions of the Community.
In the reform of the structural Bottoms there #be not any reason for a joy exaggerated but have found a viable commitment that guarantees that the #european solidarity do not derive in the future to a mere statement of lips outside.
Finally, and it is the will of the members of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, is indispensable to introduce a program of action and of information in front of the consumers with the end that they know essentially the effects of the products of the vineyard in his health.
We freeze the third category; in the *cuarta only offers  a statement by #if the crisis of *Kosovo needed a review of the financial perspectives, and  *nos announces that the Council #would be had to accept a review before the entrance in vigour of the financial perspectives that want that we adopt today.
*Me Seems that also the *isleños coincide with the wide majority of the Parliament and of the Commission in that the principle of the economic and social cohesion shows  especially in the deal that gives  to the regions of structures feebler, by it that we want to assign to these regions the 70 % of #all the credits, so much #if they live in firm earth as in islands.
#If we are sincere #one with #others, know that it do not has any sense take only of the *insularidad a look of the that derive  the helps, as the point of game of the structural helps, like this appears also in the Treaty, is to compensate the disadvantages of regions and social groups and is to #this to it that *nos have to adhere in his own interest.
Here it has to take part the Diary 2000 to provide the indispensable means for his *prosecución with the infrastructures *cofinanciadas by the *FEDER, by the *FEOGA-Orientation or by the Bottom of Cohesion, #as well as the training or reallocation of the hand of drama, for it that requires  the support of the Social Bottom.
Of compliance with the Presidential Decree 738/98 on the entrance of help humanitarian *proveniente of the foreigner, from then only recognises  like addressees of humanitarian help that do not become tariffs to the juridical persons of public utility recognised in his statutes but no to the particular persons.
Whereas the initial administrative difficulties of the program «oil by foods» already have surpassed  in his greater part, today day the main problem of the program represents it the scarce capacity of export of the *Iraq and the distribution of the materials of help medical to the population.
The European Union underlines his disposal to support the process of reforms in *Argelia, especially, in the frame of the European Cooperation for the Mediterranean, and to continue the political dialogue initiated with the #algerian authorities.
Gentleman President, in it *tocante to a possible *upgrading of the contractual relations among the European Union and *Croacia believe that the Mr. Deputy will have clear that #this makes  in the frame of the regional strategy of the EU, #such as it determines  in the conclusions of the Council of Subjects General of the 29-4-1997.
I believe that the Social Bottom European is a half to give a support to the development of the employment in *Europa, to the equal that the bottom for the rural development is a half that it will be able to take possible the big toning that will have to take great parts of the agricultural sector.
In any case, appreciate also the efforts that has made the salient Commissioner, the one who carried out a very hard work, no only to the hour to visit the regions depressed of the Union, but -especially- in #everything it relative to *Irlanda of the North and to the programs *transfronterizos.
Like speaker for the approval of the management of 1997 in relation to the bottoms, wanted to signal a problem that is the that a country as, for example, *Holanda, continuously sees  reflected negatively in the reports of the Court of Accounts, due to the fact that there they have a more precise form to inform that in any #another country.
To end to achieve this goal, the Commission is had to incorporate the most modern media so that the Parliament #can exert his scrutiny of way continuous and using the technical means more recent.
They have reached  important progresses in the debate on the definition of his content and his incorporation to the juridical foundations of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community and of the Treaty of the European Union and fault little so that we #can give it by finished.
Without embargo, in political questions so important like the incorporation of the Agreement of *Schengen and the Agreement of association with two countries of special significance, believe that the Council #would owe *haberlas subjected to query of the Parliament and #would have to have taken into account the points of sight that had been able to expose this institution.
They arise doubts regarding the security, the operation, the payment, the treatment of the confidential information, the abuse of data personal, the quality of the products and the fault of advice.
I support the amendments that improve the directive, without embargo, do not support the legislative text in his group and the Movement of June neither supports the legislative text in his group because it follows splitting of the principle that takes reference to the country of the *remitente.
It is true that, in electronic matter, precisely by the big rape of the privacy that #can suppose the fact that we introduce in our houses the computer and that, in the screen, our children, our friends, our familiar #can see exposed to a bombardment of information, probably no wished, takes that they appear principles of public order.
A possibility #would be the to approve the report now and retain the communication to the Council until the Committee of the Regions decide #if it pronounces  or no to the *respecto, and another possibility #would be to postpone the vote to morning, as it seems that the Committee of the Regions #can give a favourable report morning.
The ideal rural regions for the Goal 5*b will explain  among the main victims of this situation: in *Francia, the third part of the ideal population in relation with this goal will leave to receive structural Bottoms after the period of transition.
The final result, although it do not answers totally to the demands of the Parliament, went amply influenced by this last to *través of the work of the Commission of Politics Regional, of the speakers and of the group commissioned of the negotiations.
The Socialist Party #european member of parliament  *opone to the amendment 7 of the report because it repeats unnecessarily existent legislation of the EU and #suffer of fault of specific clarity on the subject of the adaptation of the machinery or the replacement of #all the machinery was or was not practical to take it.
Our external politics and of common security has worked correctly in this case as this statement was important to guarantee the peaceful and constructive continuation of the process of peace in spite of the expiration of the *primer interim period fixed by the Agreements of *Oslo.
We consider, without embargo, that has got the moment of an extraordinary action: we wanted to take advantage of this famous year 2000 -a year that has a big symbolic value for #all the countries of the world and no only for the that have some tradition, history and religion- to carry out an extraordinary gesture.
As it finishes to remember the colleague *Imbeni, has got the hour to use also this year 2000 to give this qualitative jump and present to the General Assembly of the Nations Joined a proposal of moratorium universal.
Have in the countries in development, in the countries *firmatarios of the Agreement of *Lomé #a lot of examples *modélicos of countries that, graces precisely to the *restablecimiento of the democratic rules, follow a path of development economic, and #that's why we have to reiterate with greater strength to *Djibuti that respect this contractual agreement that has signed with his #european partners.
Gentleman President, the existent difficulties to punish to those who have incurred in offences #such like genocides, crimes of war and, in general, offences against the humanity have shown *sobradamente the need of the instauration of an International Penal Court, that was active what before and in conditions to proceed effectively to the persecution of these offences so that they do not follow *impunes.
In the century *XIX to the *Comoras  the designated «the archipelago of the *sultanes *batalladores», because the Big *Comora and *Anjouan are dominated by #some familiar organisations purportedly noble that contest  the power from takes centuries, that impose his privileges to the immense majority of the population, and keep great social inequalities, economic monopolies *injustificables and a truly mediaeval organisation of the society.
I quote of the report of the International Commission for *Temelin. In this moment, the capacity of production is upper to the needs and the electricity produced by the nuclear head office of *Temelin so only will serve to reduce the production in other fields.
*Me Joins a personal bow to the subject that is treating . My *primer report, a modification of the Treaty of the European Community of the Coal and of the Steel, analysed the failure of *Ferrovie Saint'#Anna, *algo that then was *inusitado, a steelworks that went to the failure.
The Commission agrees with the Mr. *Hoppenstedt in that the pavilion of the Union has to present the best possible image of the European Union in the century *XXI: a European Union that it is democratic, transparent, respectful of the law, socially just, *tolerante and culturally diverse.
In my country, #where this sector represents the 25 % of the employment of the transformative industry and the 30 % of the exports, #where there are regions almost exclusively dependent of *él, by it that conditions the life of the generality of the familiar groups, thousands of workers and employers expect the future with expectancy and hope, but also with #a lot of doubts and questions.
Our position, no only in relation with the textile industry but with the productive system European in general, adjusts  to the need, first, that the sector has to accept the conditions of a global economy, and, second, that has to take an effort to increase his levels of productivity and of competitiveness.
In *tercer place, is a big misfortune that after having spent so much money of the taxpayer in this new building, #can not give true example for the century *XXI -for the new #millenium- of the type of society open that the European Parliament wants to see in the future.
It treats  no only of a *combatiente *encarnizado of the democracy in his country, of a big man that has helped in the process of decolonisation and to build a juster world and more open, but that also embodies admirably the dimension -say- sportive, that it is necessary *reconocerle to the democracy.
To #all *nos costs a lot understand #which was this message of the Commission, apart from that for the resales supposes fine #news, and bad #news for the fans to the football, that give  to understand that #one #can go out  really with the #his and *infringir the law always that it was had to give some *monedillas to the European Commission in a back moment of the process.
#If we had accepted *pasivamente the existence of a nationalism *sanguinario, of an aggressive nationalism in our continent, the destination of the own #european integration, the greater attainment of the #european history more recent, #would have been in game.
The European Union and his States members supported actively under the #german Presidency of the Council the war of the NATO in the *Balcanes, that *quebrantó the international Right and ousted to the UN, at the same time that remained sealed the transformation of the Community in a called defensive Union.
In name of my political Group want to say very clearly that we do not go to *enjuiciar to the Commission and to the new Commissioners by his political membership but by his capacity, the clarity and accuracy of his positions in the past and in the present. In our opinion, east has to be the only criterion of assessment.
In particular, will have to find an apt system to guarantee the continuous and exhaustive information of the Parliament on the course of the reform respecting, to #the same time, the autonomy of the Commission in the management of his competitions.
I do not share this analysis: for me the Conference *Intergubernamental is a crucial appointment for the #european Institutions and is our opportunity, the last perhaps, for *prepararnos for the possible duplication of the number of members of the States of the Union.
*Le Propose that *reflexione on the need to correct the route, and the two banks of proofs *me seems that they have suggested  in this debate: the first refers  to the relation among *Europa and the world, the second refers  to *Europa among the #european construction and the different realities of the distinct countries.
The enlargement presupposes an adaptation of the institutions of the Union: we have begun already the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental of the countries members with the goal to take a report on this subject, of #whose editorial will commission  the President and that it will be exposed in the summit of *Helsinki.
In the summit of *Tampere, that will treat, among other things, the problems of the shelter and of the political asylum, #as well as of the international delinquency organised, it will be necessary to take concrete propositions of the measures to take to improve the internal security.
We have to accelerate by #all the means the preparation of said report and his owed discussion in the European Parliament, but #can not deliver the legitimate rights of the Parliament in hands of an organ of investigation unofficial neither *atenernos to his diary to elaborate the report.
The politics to follow for the»#nordic dimension», concept already ratified by the European Union, has to take into account, among other things, the collaboration with the countries *Bálticos, and also the materialisation of the strategy to follow with *Rusia, subject that also has been decided in principle.
This goal sees  *desmoronado by the principle according to the *cual the EU has to have a will, a politics and an only voice. This principle was refused by the 70 percent of the Finns that have not voted in the elections of the European Parliament.
Nobody has talked of *ello before me, but exists a problem that has not confronted  or at least no with the determination wished by the European Union: it is the of the three one thousand #kosovar prisoners, literally *raptados by the Mr. *Milosevic and his *esbirros during the last days of the international intervention in *Kosovo and moved by the strength to the prisons of Serbian.
The External Politics and of Common Security will allow to reach, from the *Balcanes, with the urgency and the obstinacy that, for the time being, imposes the situation, the goals of the peace, of the economic welfare, of the certainty of the respect of the human rights.
We entrust in that it was a reconstruction no only material, but also immaterial: reconstruct roads, schools, ports, aqueducts, but also the confidence of persons that during years have seen  deprived of the right to live with his affections in his earth, with his work and that today aspire to achieve carry this calm life that *les was denied during years.
As, *acaso #can admit a situation in that a Commission *demisionaria follow exerting his functions from the past month of March and taking part to try weaken the application of an only price of the book and to formulate the mandate of the next negotiation in the *OMC, #whose importance for the coming years is known?
In fact, I suspect that #many of our colleagues are not so *duchos in technology as they had to be, but this technology goes to have an enormous effect in the opening of the only market and before that at all we owe *asegurarnos that the legislation do not limit the capacity of the persons for *innovar and introduce changes and new forms of electronic trade.
On 29 June 1999, to the President of the Commission, Mr. *Santer,  *le communicated the decision of the Mr. *Bangemann to leave the Commission to assume a place in the private sector two days later, on 1 July 1999.
I believe that now we have to have the value, that have to ask the value of the Council and of the Commission, in the first place to learn of the errors of the past, to cut with the agricultural politics carried out up to now, and take finally an election rope, wise and necessary by a #european agriculture of quality.
How many times will be still require that have accidents repeated, in this type of utilisations, so that it put  end to this absurd system according to the *cual the earths are in fallow, the agriculturalists need to work, take live the heritage and the landscape of #ours *Europa, but find  in the inability to take it because  *privilegia the utilisation of the recycling of wastes and, in particular, of animal wastes.
His mandate has been expanded in relation with it that foresaw the article first of the Protocol on the institutions attach to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, since the Council of Colony has added, by own initiative, the possibility of extension of the votes with qualified majority.
Excellent the statement on the need of a *Kosovo *plurinacional; now well, the that the resolution advocate that this national plurality was guaranteed by the *UCK do not seems of receipt, unless it was necessary to interpret it in key of #black humour. More still *cuando in a paragraph asks  the disarmament of the soldiers and *paramilitares of the own *UCK,  suppose that because it considers  that it constitutes a threat for the progress (*plurinacional) of *Kosovo!!!
Ladies and Gentlemen, believe that for the European Union, in matter of sport, today is *prioritario avert that it sanction  to a country member that reached to organise with hit this event, and initiate in particular, as it said it yesterday Roman *Prodi, a true #european fight against the doping, for example; it is to say, deny to that only the logic of the money finish with the beauty and the own spirit of the sport.
*Cuando In these last times, the European Parliament has treated to strengthen his control on the Commission, and the theory of the independence had to, as, as it is logical, retreat, see like #this *resurge and strengthens  with a new strength; no already regarding the commissioners, but to the services.
With #the same spirit, the Commission goes to answer to the report establishing a service of audit internal, as it recommends the Committee, and reiterate our commitment for reinforcing the financial cells in #all the general directions.
For me today it is a reason of satisfaction -that want to take public- have listened in this Assembly to the still Commissioner #Manuel *Marín refer to the future of the Commission with #the same honesty of the that has taken #gala along his mandates and with #the same dignity with the that has assumed the problems of the previous School of Commissioners.
I want to finalise my intervention appreciating to the Mr. *Marín his big work during #all these years in his responsibilities in the Commission and the last, especially, like President in functions of the Commission and *deseándole to the Mr. *Kinnock #a lot of luck, #a lot of touch and good tempt in the difficult tasks that *le expect in the next months and years.
We expect to develop the program of action for the reform together with the responsible Commissioner and although we have not had time to study it in detail, believe that it #would be just *pedirle to the Commissioner a debate and a clear justification of why do not undertake  some measures #if #some of the recommendations remain excluded.
. Gentleman President, in reality, in the report that has presented the Mrs. #Jackson there #be a point that do not refers  so much to the content as to the juridical form that #can choose  to try resolve the problem of the environmental minimum criteria in the States members.
It is just to affirm that in the past existed the opinion generalised that the European Parliament and the European Commission had to work almost in a state of collusion permanent to take  charge of the rights purchased of the States members and boost like this the #european integration.
It is an ideal fight to give to the Europeans the sense of a common destination, of a common mission, of a common identity, of a common civilisation and of a common homeland.
I wish to remember also that the competitiveness of the agriculture do not measures  only in the world-wide markets, but also to the light of the balance of the territories, of the maintenance of the rural tissue and of the conservation of the natural heritage.
Gentleman President, the great challenges that *nos expect - the enlargement, the deepening in a #european reality that respect the national identities by means of a new approach of the subsidiariness, the *salvaguarda of our agriculturalists, the construction of #one *Europa more human in matter of employment and more generous - are of #such importance that is precise that the confront together.
The group of the subjects that have debated *nos allow to express our vote of confidence with regard to it that the Mr. *Prodi has defined "a new start" : a common expression that *atañe to the Commission, but that, to my trial, also concerns to this new Parliament.
We will vote in the frame of the Socialist Group of the European Parliament no on a base of politics *partidista, but on the objective base of the auditions and the answers to the questions that have formulated during the last weeks.
Second, in the audience occupied an important space no only the pending subjects regarding the enlargement of the Union, but also the inclusion of the agricultural model European in the future negotiations in the frame of the *OMC to scale international and especially his defence.
In my quality of deputy of a border region among *Bélgica, *Alemania, *Luxemburgo and the Low Countries, *yo #can *transmitirles the expectations of #a lot of Europeans in the field of the daily life, but especially also his *incomprensión in front of the countless fetters that still exist among the States members.
#Some of His *Señorías will remember definitely that *Yannos *Kranidiotis was deputy to the European Parliament of January of 1995 to February of 1997, date in the that it was appointed Prime minister of the Government of #Grecia and will remember that in our Parliament was member of the Commission of Subjects External and of the Commission of Budgets, as also vice-president of the Delegation in the Mixed Parliamentary Commission European Union/*Chipre.
Finally, we need that *Tampere was a summit that *movilice to the public opinion, that adapt his ambitions to the human and financial resources that we have, but that *nos offer guidelines to show the importance of the freedom, the security and the justice to the man of the street.
That they encourage  for providing to the #european citizens protection against the injustice, so that the that they are detained far of his countries #can have assistance *letrada, services of interpretation and conditional arrest instead of treating to harmonise the juridical diets Europeans; that they begin for achieving that there #be a justice *transfronteriza for the persons that suffocate  with the *mordaza of an onerous bureaucracy.
The experience purchased like minister of Interior of #Italia *me takes to say that it is indispensable to accelerate the path to norms and common politics, exactly it contrary of the invocation of politics strictly national and that, regarding the immigration and the asylum, the better base is the that appears in the text of the #austrian Presidency of autumn of the year 1998.
The #european judicial network is, undoubtedly, the less developed of the three areas that *nos occupy and, in this sense, believe that the creation of a stable unit, attendant to give continuity to the judicial cooperation and to be the judicial speaker of *Europol, #can be adapted.
Lady Speaker, our presence here in *Estrasburgo has his origin in the extraordinary tradition of #Robert *Schuman, #whose Community of the Coal and of the Steel no only meant an important step to the economic integration, culminated recently with the arrival of the euro, but that also *redundó in benefit of the political integration.
As well, in the Summit of *Tampere the Council has the opportunity to create *algo #as well as a community of the coal and of the steel of the justice, the freedom and the security in the breast of our European Union.
Therefore, *yo believe that it is indispensable that in *Tampere take  decisions that *clarifiquen the situation, that are steps to forward on the decision, already positive, adopted in Colony; on the character, on the content, on the relation with the Conference *Intergubernamental, on the procedures of preparation and on the own approval of the Letter of rights fundamental.
As well, by part of the Commission of the European Union have subjected  to criticism, have put  in cloth of trial determined #tending fiscal measures to improve the economic activity and to reduce our high level of unemployment, measures that were adopted by the #basque institutions in exercise of his sovereignty and *autogobierno in the matter.
Then I backed with decision his work of government and no *escatimé efforts to avert that the Government of centre left that chaired  *sumiera -precisely takes a year- in a crisis favoured by the initiative of the political Group led by the Mr. *Bertinotti.
The #european institutions, in particular the European Commission and the European Parliament, go out *engrandecidas of the auditions of the Commissioners designated and the #european citizens, that the have followed (by the press), will be able to find in *ellas -expect- reasons to interest  more by the #european construction.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0009/99) of the Mrs. *Dührkop *Dührkop and of the Mr. *Fabra *Vallés, in name of the Commission of Budgets, on the projects of budgets *rectificativos and supplementary *nº 1, 3 and 4 to the budget of the European Communities for the exercise 1999 (*C5-0021/1999, *C5-0074/1999 and *C5-0130/1999).
Or, and *eso *me seems more #likely, is that the budgetary authority, to the hour to elaborate the budgets, do not takes into account in sufficient measure the needs of credit and the capacity of absorption real of the different programs?
In the greater part of these situations it is necessary to recognise that a timely action of the international community based in evaluations and early #alert of the situations #can have saved beyond all doubt #a lot of lives and have reduced *muchísimo the misfortune and the human sufferings.
Subject: Convention of the Nations Joined against the delinquency organised In the article *K.1 of the *TUE, the States members engage  to warn and combat #all the forms of delinquency international and contemplate the fight against the delinquency organised like a subject of interest common.
The elimination of mines terrestrial, the customs and the acquisition of supplies basic for the rehabilitation of the houses, the public buildings and, in particular, the Hospital of *Mitrovica are the main points of attention.
The initial results of this examination of the damages that have suffered the houses and the local infrastructure were published in the conference of donors organised by the Commission and the World-wide Bank the past July.
The achievement of a just peace in Orient Half, by the that plead in the Socialist Group, only is possible #if, beside the negotiations on the subjects that compose the diary of peace of this complex conflict, solves  the problem of the refugees.
Gentleman President, our Group withdraws the amendment 1, because it has agreed  that on the need of squads permanent sent under the supervision of Nations Joined to zones of international crises  debate with general character in the Committee of Subjects External, *cuando #this do not extends , obviously, to *Timor Oriental.
The Commission already has manifested to *Rusia with #all clarity that to invest the tendency of flight of capital is necessary an urgent improvement and integral of the surroundings of investment and a better protection of the rights of the investors in *Rusia.
The recent death of two #guinean youngsters in a plane with destination to *Bruselas, tragic luck that the Speaker remembered when opening, this Monday, the partial period of sessions, is a cry of alarm that has to *preocuparnos, to the #european deputies, and that it has to *hacernos react.
In this context, the Union is making important efforts of mediation and of promotion of the dialogue to the different levels of the conflict, and the Commission is had to work by the hit of the agreement of #alto the fire of *Lusaka in the following fields.
Lady Speaker, this Parliament, as we said along the debate on the investiture of the President of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, will exert an increasingly important paper, and believe that the works of this Parliament will have to be increasingly known in #all the States members of the European Union.
Finally, *me upsets the design *chillón and the combination of colours of #some *alfombrados in the zones of bars, that remember, as it already has said another deputy, to a cheap nocturnal bar in place to evoke the atmosphere dignified wished for this Assembly.
Estimated colleague *Hautala, in it that concerns to the representatives of the Parliament in the Conference of the *OMC in *Seattle already have declared of common agreement that the European Parliament has to be represented in the number of 15 deputies to the equal that the #american Congress that takes  like reference, is to say, this position remains invariable independently that finally we adopt or no a resolution.
Like this as, to ensure an alimentary security in front of it unknown, believe that further of the practice of the scientific committees as it takes  too much in States Joined - and it *deploro, even among *nosotros, in the European Union - with decisions adopted to enclosed door, is precise first of all guarantee a true and complete information to the consumer already from the sources of production.
As it is obvious, share the premises of the decision *nº 640 of the Commission of date 23 September 1999, in the *cual  *recalcó that, according to the WHO, the dioxin is #one of the substances more *cancerígenas that exist, reason by the *cual the WHO has recommended to keep an admissible daily dose the same to 1-4 *picogramos by kilogram of corporal weight.
The difficulty  *nos #can pose for the next year and, in fact, in the own decision of the Commission, #if his *Señorías see in the page 7, in the section 4 the reference to this subject, says  of form very clear that, given the existent budgetary restrictions, #can pose #any difficulty and an adjust in the category 4.
The upper increase to the average registered in *Dinamarca, in *Alemania and also in *España *nos shows the narrow relation that exists among the conditions of access to the networks and the taxes of increase of the corresponding part to the pertinent electricity of sources of renewable energy.
I receive with *beneplácito the amendment *n1 6 to the letters and) to) (new) of the article 2 on the need to boost the export of technologies for the renewable energies of the European Union and boost to the European Council of Export of Renewable Energies.
In the first place, an energetic politics according to the environment, an energetic politics that bet by the future of our planet, is *algo that it has to be present no only in the energetic politics but in any #worthy politics of this name *cuando are in the primes of the century *XXI.
By it that refers  to the amendment 6, wanted to remember here the favourable received of the Commission to the report presented by the Parliament on the new perspectives of the European Union in matter of export of technology and services for the utilisation of the renewable energies *cuando was presented in the Plenary of the past 15 January.
According to the valid economic principles, the offer of energy cheap is totally incompatible with the reduction of the consumption. In #such context the measures allocated to boost the energetic saving tend to *difuminarse.
Regarding the proposal of recommendation for the *segunda reading, wish to take two considerations and remember that the program *SAVE is oriented mainly to improve the investigation and the exchange of knowledges technical, #as well as to supervise and control the results reached in the sector (article 2), although with an endowment limited of financial resources.
Gentleman President, want to appreciate again to the Parliament, and very especially to the Mrs. *Ahern, the work made and the support reiterated to the politics of the Commission, specifically regarding the improvement of the utilisation of the energy and to the increase of the energetic efficiency that contemplates the program *SAVE.
The past week make a series of changes significant in the maximum administrative levels of the Commission, on the base of a concrete cultural change of the systems of nomination.
I have to add that so much the gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen as *yo have the intention to act so that, in the future, the Commission centre  in the most horizontal questions of the business politics, because the sectorial speeches the leave for other organs of decision.
Of this form will be able to establish  #if the decision of the #french Government took  on the base of facts new, in #whose case will have his value, or #if, by the contrary, took  against of the general norms and then is clear that it will have to withdraw of a form or of #another in the next hours.
In February of 1998, as a result of the criticisms of the Organ of Appeal of the *OMC, the Commission launched 17 studies with the end to facilitate supplementary information concerning the risks in sectors #such as the toxicology, the undue use and the environmental looks.
I am convinced that this Parliament goes to exert an essential paper in the debates that go to take place in a next future, especially *cuando after the decision of *Helsinki to concede to *Turquía the status of candidate, begin the wide process of approximation of the legislations, of the "*screening" .
Finally, #all, or the majority of *nosotros, know that the diet of the individual freedoms, of the freedom of press, the diet in the prisons and of the police interrogations of *Turquía do not have at all that see with the democracy in the #european civilisation.
It is not sufficient the politics of the promises: it that serves is the politics of the concrete facts, the respect of the human rights, the abolition of the pity of death knowing, without embargo, that the question *kurda is not a #one question that affects to *Turquía exclusively.
The question of the security, without embargo, #can not hide the illegality of the military occupation or of the bombardments against the civil personnel like the that they produce  in the south of the *Líbano, or the existence of prisons like the of *Qian, although it follows being *prioritaria the #palestinian question.
The help of the European Union to *Cisjordania and the Strip of *Gaza among 1994 and 1998 elevated  to a total of 1.500 millions of euros and the help of the European Union to the Organism of dramas public and aid of Nations Joined during #the same period rose to roughly 505 millions of euros.
Lady Speaker, the proposal of the Conference of Presidents for the calendar of sessions of the European Parliament for the year 2000 got to my hands only after the closing of the term for the presentation of amendments.
In this moment *me gave account that there #be a *plenario in *Estrasburgo, specifically the of 12 June of the 2000, that coincides with the Monday of *Pentecostés, that is a day of party official, and therefore a no working day in varied of the States members of the European Union, that are *Bélgica, *Dinamarca, *Alemania, *Francia, *Luxemburgo, Low Countries, *Austria and *Suecia.
Gentleman President, in the first place, want to say that I am very satisfied with this vote on the calendar, no owing to a governmental commitment, like the colleague *Berthu, but because I am convinced that only by means of the full use of the labour week will keep  our capacity of work, is to say, #if of a Thursday do not takes  a Friday.
We make, simply, a distinct assessment of the principle of caution. As it occurs often, the Commission gives a high grade of priority to the free circulation of products, and is interesting to check that, by a time, *Francia situates the alimentary security of his citizens to an even more high level.
It wanted to that it cooperate  immediately of a much more intense mood with *Turquía of it that has taken  up to now, that release  the financial protocols and that take  reality a narrow cooperation to a level underneath of the full adhesion, whereas #that that have voted in favour of the resolution, propagate in part the goal *incumplible of a full adhesion so that they #can *utilizarla to humiliate and *vejar to *Turquía.
The President of the Commission left clear his orientation, *cuando, in the speech of investiture, affirmed that it was necessary to follow restructuring the Only Market and boosting the liberalisation and underlined on purpose the continuation of the process of liberalisation of the sectors of sakes and services.
Therefore, it #would expect of the Commission and of the States members that, in the new editorial of the text of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, established  an independent and impartial system of solution of controversies that no *nos put in front of the feet of the horses as it has occurred in the past.
Thus, I want to suggest two things: in the first place, we #would owe *adherirnos to the requirement of the colleague *Lange to coordinate closely with the Parliament the trade on the broadcasts, as a so gigantic interference in the commercial politics is hardly to carry out against the Parliament.
#Such as it stipulates  in the article 6 of the Treaty on the European Union, the Union bases  in the common principles to the States members of freedom and democracy, of respect of the fundamental rights and of the basic freedoms, #as well as in the of the State of Right.
How measured thinks to adopt the Council to guarantee the rigorous fulfillment of the community legislation in this field? Has the Council the intention to urge to the Commission so that it incorporate to the community legislation the recommendations of the *ICCAT?
Finally, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, want *preguntarle #if the fact that a number -and *usted *me will say #which- of #european ships have substituted the networks of mesh to the derives by other *artes of high performance means greater protection for the *pesquerías of tuna or #if, by the contrary, is detecting  the contrary effect of the that wanted, is to say, an increase of the pressure on the populations of *túnidos.
When approving the new rule of the structural Bottoms the past month of June, the Council determined in the basic regulation the main goals, the general principles and the procedures of programming for the period 2000-2006.
But like the Council *le commissioned to the Commission the application of this rule, the Council do not has competitions to determine the strategies to follow in the different sectors of the peripheral regions of the Goals 1 and 2, that are under this rule.
In the moment in that a North American study reveals racial inequalities in the administration of the pity of death in *Filadelfia, the North American Government #would honour  in taking position against this flagrant rape of the International Agreement of Civil Rights and Politicians.
Therefore the Commission has *preconizado in the past in his White Book on the *descongestión of the aerial space European, that the aerial space European has to be object of a central management carried out by a strong international organisation that occupy  of #all the looks of his use.
It is necessary to devote more bottoms to the alternative energetic resources and when seeming has  the impression of that in the future will happen  of the utilisation of fuels solid and oil to the natural gas and to the sources of energy renewable and of generation of electricity.
We have not gone it sufficiently fast, because treating of civil servants think that it was useless to expect to finals of October to take a decision of application with regard to the agents of the Parliament; it had sufficed a simple decision of the Table, adopted on the base of the section 5 of the article 22.
My colleague, the Mr. *Wuermeling, has cleared already with reason that the directive leaves in hands of the States members determine, when an electronic statement of will that goes. *Provista Of a digital signature has to equate to a statement with handwritten signature or to a statement for the *cual the Law prescribes the form written.
In the field of the security and of the technology, without embargo, *revisten a big importance the technical data, the parameters, the characteristics and the materials that use , #as well as the levels of maintenance and the terms of programming.
How presupposed is the that links until #such point to the budgetary authority with legislative acts, that #some figures, #some great reflected in the legislative acts and in the programs are so *vinculantes that tend to reduce the budgetary procedure to a group of arbitrations legislative already effected?
In the costs of the Parliament is inscribed a reservation of 7,4 millions of euros referent to leases of the building *Belliard, because the agreement of lease among the owner and the *arrendatarios, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, even is not concluded.
#If it concludes  the agreement of lease before the end of the year, will deduce  the sum quoted of the budget of the Parliament; in fact, the budget of the Parliament represents in this moment the 20,11% of the *rúbrica 5 and the maximum limit fixed by the own Parliament is of the 20%.
It seems that also they #would have to  reassign the endowments allocated to humanitarian help for *Kosovo, specifically because big part of the refugees has gone back already to *Kosovo and because the humanitarian help #would constitute a *primer step in the path of the reconstruction of *Kosovo, providing, in the point of game, the protection to the persons during the winter.
Second, by the contrary, in the three proposals, the forecasts for possible new commitments are in part very inferior to the amounts *homónimos for the present year. And #this although it foresees  a big increase of the relative games to the actions in the frame of the *preadhesión, or was, the credits for the candidates to the adhesion.
I appreciate the commitment that have shown in the fight against the fraud in the European Union and, in particular, the supplementary commitment that have decided: the Commission of Budgets has voted in favour of a supplementary quantity of 9 millions of euros for the *OLAF.
*Nos Occupy of the programs of energy, the relative to the industry, included the small and medium enterprises, the programs of investigation made inside the programs mark, which *equivale, of course, to pretty much the 60% of the cost in internal politics of the European Union, and the lines on trade and technical assistance.
Using the quantities decided the past year by means of the conciliation on the report *Whitehead, the budgetary lines devoted to questions of consumption will follow generating confidence in the public opinion, *dándoles the tranquility that no only are #one *Europa opened to the businesses, but that also take campaign in favour of the rights of the citizens like consumers.
Step now in brief to the transport, #if *me allow it, only to say to the deputies that expect that they #can support the initiatives of the Commission of Budgets for *restituir the cuts in the line devoted to the security in the transport and the cuts in the line on sustainable mobility.
I share the rejection of the speaker regarding the proposal of the European Commission to organise from now the cooperation for the development through some geographic lines and to reduce the thematic budgetary lines.
Still there #be #one or two countries in the that the Commission and the Parliament follow separated regarding the structure and have to be especially alerts in the cases in the that more of the 75% or the 80% of the credits devote  to pay the wages and the buildings in place of to some suitable informative politics.
In the field of this strategy *nos pleases to take note that *Timor constitutes #one of the priorities of this budget and, in particular, *nos *congratulamos of the acceptance by the speaker of the registration of a new line to confront the reconstruction of this territory, as, by it other, proposed and approve in the Commission of Development and Cooperation.
Simultaneously, without embargo, have to treat to modify the contents and the logic of the budget with the sight put in the challenges that the Union will have in front of yes in the next years and, especially, in the fact that the true enemy to beat in each #one of the States members is the unemployment.
An active presence of the European Union in the world-wide stage and his convinced availability to progressive politics of enlargement also to the *Europa *suroriental, to the *Balcanes in this perspective of enlargement virtual and parallel of the peace and of the security outlined by the Mr. President *Prodi, are #one of the #few and safe guarantees of stability and prosperity in *Europa that #can not be neglected.
Still it is not concluded the work of evaluation of the costs of the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental, #as well as of the back financial plan international of support, by it that still is not possible a calculation *cabal of the #european participation in the costs of the reconstruction.
So that the incorporation to the EU constitute a notorious and profitable change for the citizens, will be necessary to change the reality, that the companies and his employees believe a labour market so dynamic like just for the workers.
The Agreement *Interinstitucional constitutes a good common legacy for the preparation of the Budget 2000 and for a fine collaboration, and in this sense, after the present debate, *yo have the confidence that we will achieve to reach of common agree a solution shared and a responsible budget for the year 2000.
Some contradictory messages about the decisions adopted by the #ECB and of the underlying reasons #can cause some expectations of market *injustificadas and increase the uncertainty, going like this against of the same goal of transparency with regard to the development of the monetary politics.
It wanted to *recalcar that the information provided in the conferences of press celebrated after the meetings of the Council of Government, together with the analysis included so much in the Monthly Bulletin of the #ECB as in the #others channels of communication approximates  a lot, in it essential, to the publication of some "records *resumidas" .
Guarantee the fine public management in the finances is a half to improve the conditions of stability of the prices and to achieve a solid sustainable growth that give place to the generation of employment.
The #ECB has to be watchdog, but like the tax of inflation half of the euro-11 follows still far of the level of the 2 %, believe that I #can expect that the Council of Governors give an opportunity to the growth and, therefore, to a supplementary reduction of the unemployment.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, before that at all we have to analyse the *primer period of activity of the Central Bank European that, as #all know, initiated his career takes a year with the hope to convert , with the time, in a fundamental institution to take part in the economy of the States members of the Union.
Simultaneously, without embargo, will have to watch  the stability of prices to be able to control this greater evil that #all know, or was, the inflation, #as well as keep low the types of interest to boost the investments and reactivate the #european industrial sector converting it in competitive regarding other States.
And *eso has carried to #some to talk of a species of aristocracy platonic of a series of experts independent to the that it entrusts  the decision on the monetary politics thinking -probably with reason- that the money is too much serious so that *nos occupy of *ello the politicians.
Also the publication of the summaries of the meetings of the Council of Administration is a fundamental act, but these summaries have to show with clarity the justifications of the decisions adopted so that the agents of the market #can adopt also his own decisions.
Concerning the coins - will know that *yo do not have responsibility on the coins, #this is a question for the ministers of economy - the big difference resides in that it is impossible to obtain #the same guarantees in it that concerns to the coins, since the coins are put in circulation, generally, by the sector of sales and no by the banks.
*Colombia Expects can fund jointly with the countries that of #one or another form see  connected to the chain of the business of the drug, the infrastructure of the project and wait, likewise, link the private capital, so much national like foreigner, to the economically productive companies so that they incorporate advanced technologies and new capitals.
(*PT) Lady Speaker, *Señorías, in the conclusions of *Tampere combine  a firm political message on the priority conceded to the construction of a Space of Freedom, Security and Justice and the worry for establishing priorities centred in the questions that affect directly to the daily life of the citizens.
The Commission proposes  with #a lot of taste act in the sense to apply the ambitious program of action of fight against the bleaching of capitals, that comports modifications so much in the external position of the Union as in the plane of the legislation of each #one of the States members.
*Yo Believe that it is #one of the basic freedoms that we have to defend, and in this sense, an only system of asylum is very important, and say it coming of a country in the that the political asylum allowed to #a lot of fighters by the freedom save his life and continue in other #european countries.
The Commission no only  *atreve to affirm that the goal is far to be reached, but that ascertains besides that grow the traffic and the consumption of *estupefacientes, it that involves that a fine part of the money spent up to now has not resulted to be an investment against the drug, but to boost his diffusion.
Splitting of my experience in the charge, now believe that the circulation without any control of the persons in world-wide terms during the next 20 or 30 years, so much #if it bases  in economic subjects as in climatic subjects, represents a colossal challenge for the order established and the democracy.
The limit that #everyone will comprise and will respect is the that in this same moment neither the Commission neither the European Parliament have formulated of precise form and detailed his position and his proposals for the next institutional negotiation that will initiate  to the beginning of the next year.
The Commission, *despechada by have not been able to block the debate,  *apresuró to appoint by his account a group of work restricted, to the that in followed described  of group of experts, *cuando results that his members are not more expert that the majority of the here present persons.
The members of the #european delegation of the *PvdA have voted in favour of an amendment that consolidates *procedimentalmente the resolutions of the European Parliament of 3 December 1998 and of 5 May 1999 related with the statute of the deputies to the European Parliament.
I have voted against the resolution of the relative European Parliament to the annual report 1998 of the Central Bank European (#ECB), as it approves said report, that, to his time, situates  in the perspective of the step to a monetary system European entirely unified.
In #day of the start of the negotiations of the *OMC, have to remember that #all strategy of companies -included the multinationals- has to take into account, in plan of equality with the economic and financial data, the human data so that millions of #european employees #can conserve his places of work and his dignity.
*Michelin Has reduced -true is- the number of his places of work in 25.000 in twenty years, but -have to remember it to #some- treats  of 25.000 disappearances of places of work owed to the efforts of productivity comparable in #all the industrial sectors and, in particular, in the of the car and of the tyres: of these 25.000 only 186 have been dismissals.
The European Union considers the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms like a key instrument in the system of security international, instrument that offers the global guidelines to promote the no proliferation of nuclear arms and the nuclear disarmament.
It #would wish that they took advantage of any opportunity to explain and highlight to his colleagues of the Senate why #would have to reconsider his vote on the Treaty and how a commitment renewed with the no international proliferation and the control of arms will benefit to the American interests in matter of security, #as well as a greater security and international stability.
The *detractores Americans of treaties like the that today *nos occupies forget the fact, aims, that the States Joined already have left to make proofs and that the Treaty helped to freeze the world-wide advance of nuclear arms *cuando States Joined enjoys of an enormous strategic advantage.
The majority of the orators have made the *importantísima distinction among the States Joined and the Administration of the States Joined, on the one hand, and the American Senate and the Republican majority in particular, by #another, as they have signalled the Mr. Baron, the Mr. *Haarder and the Mr. *Elles #among others.
Gentleman President, now has remained perfectly clear that the majority of the colleagues of this Assembly share my *convencimiento that the tragedy of *Chechenia #can have averted #if the European Union had shown a firm attitude with regard to the #russian aggression.
Although it is simpler to understand through the plots of agencies and institutions, a basic purpose of the program will be to break this barrier and favour the culture of the bases of the society, since his function is not to create an official culture.
On the other hand, the just worry expressed by the Mr. #Perry, signatory of said amendment, regarding that the Parliament had to control in these years the cost and the budget of the Observatory, follows valid from the moment in that we leave the five years, is to say, leave to the Observatory the possibility to program organic and amply the valuable functions that has.
The transparency to establish in this way is a previous condition *irrenunciable for the political performance in the road of *Europa to the society of the information, although perhaps #this no *les enjoy too much to #that that want that they open  wide open without limitations the doors to some interests of power in the market.
In the future, the Commission foresees to expand the activities that makes the Observatory, in particular, in two concrete fields: the application of a statistical structure to treat the information in the frame of *Eurostat and the preparation for the negotiations of the *GATT 2000.
Nevertheless these difficulties and the *recrudecimiento of the problems registered lately, said idea has carried to the Parliament to extend to *Turquía the proposal in the session of the past 25 February and, takes some days, to the Commission to take a measure in this sense.
I create, simply, that the problems that have posed  in this occasion will be examined by the Commission of Budgets, in the frame of the group of work created by the president *Wynn, on the group of the politics of subvention of our institution.
The articles 2 and 4 of the Annex of the Regulation collect #some disposals that contradict clearly the Protocol on the privileges and the immunities in it that to the condition of the deputies refers  and that, besides, regulate the question of the immunity of a form that moves away of it stipulated in the corresponding rule of the mentioned protocol.
Decide *impulsivamente and by majority a question of this type attributing to the subject of the *anejos a meaning that do not takes into account that these agreements affect to fundamental questions, supposes, in some mood, be missing to the fundamental reason, to the purpose to be of the norm that are treating.
1) we Wish that it underline  the importance of the no resolved problems by the Round *Uruguay (and #whose harmful effects today begin to suffer) in the fields of the social costs that *yo mentioned before, but also in the of the environment, of the public health, of the feeding, #etcetera.
With #everything, is necessary to remember that, solos against #all, or almost, *nos had denied to approve the Round *Uruguay, so much in the #french National Assembly as in the European Parliament, precisely by this reason: we thought that it was very dangerous to accept important reductions of tariffs *aduaneros, without having resolved before the essential collateral problems.
Support, in this sense, and have said it on purpose ten pertaining deputies to the subgroup Free Alliance European of the Green Group/European Free Alliance, the resolution presented by the Popular Party European, by the Socialist Party European and by the Group *UEN.
It affects to a form of life that populates our coasts, of #the same form that with the agriculture populates  our inner territory and -why not to say it- affects to a fundamental contribution of the feeding of #all the group of the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, the #french study confirms that in the case of the *EEB do not exist reliable scientific criteria to determine the cause, the mood of transmission and the period of incubation of the illness, not even regarding the human variant of the *EEB.
To continuation both parts signed a new protocol that establishes the technical and financial conditions in the frame of the *cuales the crafts of the Community #can fish in the waters of *Angola for the period comprised among 3 May 1999 and on 2 May of the 2000.
This type of agreements -always that they conserve  the biological resources, is to say, that do not produce  #one *sobrexplotación- also benefits to the countries in the that it carries out the activity, so much by the monetary contribution of the European Union as by the help that provides , for example, in matter of professional training and of scientific investigation.
The opacity that accompanies to the processes of the dialogue *macroeconómico, the absence in east, even of the European Parliament, take more intense #ours worry by *encontrarnos, once again, in front of an attempt to revoke the fundamental rights of the workers and of *minar it that it #can remain in *Europa of the social model European.
As well, these four actors are an extraordinarily dangerous mix that, on the one hand, treats to delete the true problem for *Europa, is to say, the fault of a true economic politics and, by #another, treats to toughen the system with negotiations little clear, to spite of the unemployment and of the market.
Have a dialogue among the that direct the monetary politics, is to say, the Central Bank European; the political strengths of *Europa, to those who represents the Council and the Presidency; and the social speakers, that represent to the strengths of the production and of the work.
Still it will take long in seeing the light and maybe is better that like this was, but anyway yes agree with the Mr. *MacCormick in that the fiscal situation of the artists that work in different countries of the Union deserves our attention. I am had to confront this problem as long as *me get wise suggestions to the *respecto.
#If it results that in some countries the social norms are more demanding that in #others, #if it results that #some norms allocated to the conservation, the defence and the protection of the environment are more demanding and more strict in some countries that in #others, will not be able to prevent that said countries go further of the generally accepted criteria.
Finally, we do not accept that it was the EU the that establish prescriptive norms to the States members on the key subject of the unemployment and consider an evil presage the suggestions that have made deputies of the another side of the Assembly this morning in the sense that they #would have to reinforce the guidelines or even *hacerlas *vinculantes.
It is necessary, nevertheless, that the guidelines and the to scale #european recommendations translate  in concrete and quantifiable goals, to the *cuales the States members have to tend with his respective national plans. Some concrete goals that establish dip *mensurables to half term, convergent in terms of tax of employment and of reduction of the *gap existent among masculine and feminine employment, even through investments in infrastructures and in the services, of promotion of the juvenile employment.
*Señorías, has formulated  repeatedly the proposal of a more systematic collaboration among the Commission and the European Parliament to the service of a more effective impulse of the strategy for the #european politics.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0042/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the Council on the fulfillment of the labour schedule of the persons of sea on board of the fuselages that use community ports (8639/1/1999 - *C5-0035/1999 - 1998/0321(*COD)) (Commission of Employment and Social Subjects) (Speaker: Mr. *Hughes)
Lady Speaker, on the presentation of the report of the Court of Accounts, is true that, in this moment, the report of the Court of Accounts -that before happened almost unobserved- has converted  in an important news and of actuality of face to the press.
By this reason, neither #would have to hesitate now in the last stone of the legislation and choose here the road of the Committee of Conciliation, since, obviously, the Council do not has  brave to give the last jump and has shown  very *remiso in a pair of points.
I want to signal that the European Commission and the European Parliament have boarded wide queries about #all these subjects with the #european industry of the car, that, voluntarily, accepted a calendar for *recortar the broadcasts of dioxide of carbon in the new cars a 25% for the year 2008.
#If our decisions mean that the simplest solution is the most used ,is to say, develop the technician to clean the gases of the combustion using catalysts that require great quantities of solution of *amoniaco, then the alone distribution of this solution of *amoniaco to #all the *gasolineras of *Europa will take that it lose  a fine part of the environmental benefit.
The program *Daphne has like goal support and recognise the work made by the no governmental organisations, #as well as other organisations -included the public authorities that occupy  of the violence-, and procure that they collaborate among *ellas, the exchange of fine practices -included projects pilot to scale community on the prevention of the violence-, and the support and protection of boys, teenage and women.
Has to measure  the real impact of the distinct types of violence on the victims to determine the timely answers, evaluate the types and the efficiency of the measures and practical to warn and detect the violence, support to the victims and warn a future exhibition to #the same.
The European Parliament and, in particular, the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities have exerted a paper of paramount importance when including firmly in the #european agenda the question of the violence against the women and the boys.
This week the world celebrates the *décimo anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Boy, that is the treaty on human rights more ratified in the world and the legal statement wider of the rights of the boys all over the world.
We have to *propiciar a collective reflection on the conditions of life of the boys in #all the #european countries, especially in the urban zones, and engage a collaboration and the bottoms of help to the families needed, especially the *monoparentales or with handicapped parents.
By this reason, the European Parliament has to send an influential message to #all the institutions of the European Union, to the international organisms and to the no governmental organisations that say that we have to take disappear this current shame.
Finally, I will say that *cuando take  the *segunda reading, #if *nos take seriously the creation of employment, #if *nos take seriously the need to keep the competitiveness of our industries, #if we are serious regarding supporting to the companies, #some of *nosotros perhaps think that we have gone too much far and that has got the moment to put a limit.
To #such end have achieved that it adopted  an amendment that foresees the obligation of the Commission to present in the year 2003 an exhaustive report to show how is it that has improved thanks to the work of this Commission of investigation.
We do not believe, without embargo, that was the moment neither the place to put dates of caducity to the #british cheque and to the discounts conceded to determined countries in the finance of said cheque, more still *cuando these proposals of decision have not been approved still in the different national Parliaments.
*Me Cheers that the Parliament have occupied  again so acutely of the question of the structure of finance and *me cheer personally even more to having been able to ascertain #a lot of common points among the positions that have exposed  today in the debate and my basic position.
The costs of agriculture constitute a very delicate question in the breast of the EU, since the agricultural politics is the only sector in the that the EU *incide in the direct income of the citizens.
#If we matter more of the 50% of the total consumption of energy of the European Union, then owe *preguntarnos how #can guarantee a security of supply in front of the climatic modifications that no only *nos #can and *nos go to reach in front of the broadcasts of CO2 that take place all over the world #if we do not react, but especially also #if they produce  modifications in the political climate.
Goal of the European Union is to create a space of freedom, security and of the right in the that it guarantee  the free circulation of the persons and in the that the citizens of the Union #can demand his rights with #the same guarantees that have in front of the Courts of his own country.
The entrance in vigour of this regulation goes to close a lagoon in the field of the international private right and represents an important step to take of the Union a space of freedom, security and of the right.
Gentleman President, treating of the report of the Mrs. *Gebhardt, do not put in doubt the fine intentions of our speakers and share his worry for strengthening the juridical security of the persons in the frame of subjects matrimonial so delicate like painful for the interested.
In relation with the development of the procedures of execution -it that calls  the *exequátur of the foreign trials- his development is beyond all doubt useful in civil matter, as in matter of divorce or of parental right, as they are useful some looks of the judicial mutual help, but is precise to take care of not going too much far by this path.
#If #one  about realistic mood to the things, it is necessary to concede of course to the countries a term of #time for the adaptation to the corresponding standards of security and not proceeding according to the method of or *desconectar immediately or leave in operation to the reactors until the end of his useful life.
What before recognise our neighbours that the nuclear security is our common worry, so much before will be possible to keep the negotiations with our neighbouring countries of a constructive and open mood and conclude also the negotiations on the enlargement.
When listening it, when listening to my mates along the debate, remembered the recent electoral campaign and the answers that had to give, in this moment, to our constituents on the needs to found and to finish the #european construction.
In this political solution, no only has to  consider how is it that *nosotros wish -are perfectly that this subject has an enormous importance in #some States members and, #such as it has shown the debate, at present especially for *Austria-, but that in a political solution it is necessary to see of course also that this subject has purchased meanwhile in the countries candidates almost a theological importance.
(IN) In relation with the scientific information and his evaluation and other, treats  of a question that am examining no only by the events of the last weeks, *cuando the agency of security alimentary of the Been member that it treats  adopted a different opinion of the of the Managerial Committee Scientist.
The goal is rather the to establish a frame in the that there #be exhaustive information on the tobacco and his dangers, that will complement the community prohibition of advertising of the tobacco to counter the efforts of this industry with seen to attract to new smokers, in particular young.
But no *me fits the lower doubt that it will expect of *nosotros that take a considerable contribution to the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental, #if well *me imagine that His *Señoría will suit *conmigo in that #others have to take contributions also and *me imagine that His *Señoría #would consider also wise on our part that we took out the educations of the activities of reconstruction in other places, in particular in *Kosovo, to watch by that the bottoms that contribute in *Timor Oriental employ  of the more effective and fast form possible.
Without embargo, *permítaseme answer to his question and say without vacillation that the resolution 1244 of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined comports a complete authority, there #be not attempt #any of *diluirla: by it that to me *respecta, is the foundation of our activity in *Kosovo and do not wish *apartarme of said resolution and of his application neither a centimetre.
Subject: Agreement of 1983 relative to the compensation to the victims of infringements violent Recently, the Commission has taken a call so that #all the States members ratified the Agreement of 1983 relative to the compensation to the victims of infringements violent.
And I believe that the #greek taxpayers have to know with how difficulties finds  the Commission in the file *Olympic, #which are the problems that has found and that *le take, from time to time, hesitate so much in front of the requests of the #greek authorities and that follow, by it that have understood in his answer, taking that the Commission doubt, even now, on the subject of the *tercer term of the help to *Olympic *Airways.
Nevertheless, #everything *ello #would remain protected then by the credibility and the common interest, and in this way #would create  a base to continue advancing to the designation of the Mr. #Solana like General Secretary of the *UEO and the full integration of #the same, without need to continue keeping a capsule allocated to house the article 5.
It is not necessary to say that I disagree of my #irish colleague the Mrs. *McKenna, because I believe that the establishment of a politics of defence of the EU is a requirement for the authentic #european integration so important like the only coin.
We wanted to that the European Parliament adopted a strong and clear position and that the right to the dignity, to the health, to finish with the poverty, to the house, to the freedom was above the liberalism, above the benefits.
Like this, as, there #be a contradiction that have signalled to his attention, gentleman President; in front of this contradiction, from my point of sight, has to give faith it that has read the President, that is "gross national product", and no it that says the original version, that is another thing, is "gross inner product".
Gentleman President, *yo also have thought that perhaps *le interest to know that today it has produced  an advance very *gratificante in the process of peace of *Irlanda of the North: the announcement of the IRE that has intention to appoint to a representative that commission  to coordinate with the General #John of *Chastelain the *decomiso of arms of the *paramilitares.
Nevertheless, now it is possible to negotiate the rules that will govern the trade of products and services, and is possible to act so that the freedoms of the capital do not propagate  to a so wide part of the planet like system of exploitation, to the equal that has occurred with the electronic capitalism.
In this sense, remember that the 174 countries members of the International Organisation of the Work that engaged  to respect the four categories of fundamental rights in matter of work, even in the case of not ratifying the agreements, are in his majority also members of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
Finally, we want some exchanges that produce a durable development, creating a bond among the agreements of trade and the #others great international commitments on the fundamental rights of the work, on the alimentary security, on the protection of the environment.
*Cuando The fault of integration has to  in the first place to a fault of resources or to insufficient capacities, is precise to provide to the countries in roads of development a technical and financial assistance to increase his capacity of negotiation and to apply the measures decided in the *OMC.
The Parliament is had to collaborate in a wide reform of the Treaties and to watch by that the European Union follow being in conditions to adopt the necessary decisions after the enlargement, without losing on the other hand his transparency for the citizens, so as to that #this #can *comprenderla and also *aceptarla.
*Yo Believe that the Parliament, in his quality of representative of the citizens and the citizens, will have to continue working acutely in the context of the next Conference *Intergubernamental to ensure that #this answer really to the great expectations of the inhabitants of the Union and also of the countries candidates to the adhesion.
*Amsterdam Already was *algo better that #others *CIG previous in the sense that it was prepared by a group of reflection in the that took part the Parliament and in the sense that it published a report detailed giving to know #all the proposals presented in the *CIG and *haciéndolas of the public command, and also because the Parliament #can send to two representatives to at least #some of the meetings.
The European Union has condemned in diverse occasions the rapes of the human rights occurred in *Afganistán, especially, the systematic discrimination and constant of women and young girls, the shootings without previous trial and the own system, based in a severe discipline and in the tightness.
It That *ustedes perhaps consider worrisome, it that go to read, is not a decision of the Parliament, is the project of decision that is integral part of the Agreement *Interinstitucional, already published - with #the same identical words - in the Official Diary of the past 31 May.
#If the governments and the citizens #can have the security that we have effective means to decide how #Be is responsible of the examination of an appeal of asylum and to confront  with the problem of the multiple appeals of asylum,  *nos will facilitate the work to promote norms of asylum elevated and *equitativas.
I take advantage of this opportunity to give the security to the Mrs. Clod *i *Cusí that the digital prints of the immigrants only use  for the planned concrete purpose in the Agreement of *Dublín -is to say for his analysis- or was to see #if they have requested asylum in another Been member.
Now it treats  to know #if it #can accept  that, little by little, decision after decision, resolving #all the problems with the pretext to fix *litigios commercial, the *ORD finish by *erigirse in a species of Court Supreme world-wide, and impose his points of sight to the governments and to the parliaments chosen.
It is necessary to defend the principle of the community preference and, therefore, the system of restitutions to the export, including the products designated "out of the annex 1", is to say, pertinent alimentary products of agricultural products Europeans that commercialise  to an upper price to the international price.
It is that, as it says the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of the Inner Market, in normal circumstances only will be able to be collected the impressions *dactilares of criminals and suspicious individuals to having committed penal infringements and no of applicants of right of asylum, refugees or citizens of third countries in irregular situation in the territory or in the border of a Been member.
The Monday the Council decided to withdraw the motion that had presented, with the pretext that it collected a fundamental article of the Universal Statement of the Human Rights; the Tuesday approved texts that quoted again the fundamental articles of #the same.
The pity of death is an extreme sanction, and this Parliament and the #european institutions have to take part with the maximum firmness in front of *Rusia so that it go back to reconsider the question, withdraw the indictment and respect our call in favour of the immediate release.
It do not is necessary to see, as, in this decision neither the absence of an external politics neither the fact that we have yielded in front of #any pressure, but that treats  of an assessment by the Union of the risk that existed - had account of the amendments proposed - of *encontrarnos, in name of this legitimate fight, and that *nosotros share, underneath of #that that had won before.
By #everything *ello, is urgent that reinforce in collaboration with the Nations Joined #all the contacts that have like European Commission to boost the development of a pact of stability. We have to promote the attention and the political energy of #all #that that are working in the zone so that the pact of stability convert  in reality.
This release is, in reality, enough *sintomática of the fault of will to effect the balance of the genocide, and especially of the will of *silenciar the implication of the #european countries, in particular of *Francia, #whose complicity, at least passive, has put in evidence a recent parliamentary investigation.
This proposal of resolution  *equivoca when mentioning the need that it go back  to *instituir or implant the democracy: rather it #would have to take a call in favour of the progress to the democracy, and propose a practical program for the European Union that facilitate this progress.
Whereas the opening to the capitalist economy translates  by the fall of the production and by a considerable impoverishment of the majority of the population, the war swallows  important sums, by not talking of the cost of the corruption that the accompanies.
It is true -and #some of *ustedes have posed it- that, regarding the relations with the Court of Accounts, there #be a problem of legislation primary that obviously will be necessary to modify, #if it wants to apply  to the European Bank of Investments #the same deal that to the community institutions.
It fits to remember the mandate of the European Council of Colony to the Commission; it fits to remember that before finals of 1999 had to have a specific and special treatment that still has not got; it fits to remember that, in these moments, are debating the legislative diary of the Commission for the year 2000.
Without embargo, #can *asegurarles, Mr. President and Mr. speaker that, in the next negotiations on a proposal *concerniente to the Canarian Islands on the base of the Article 299 (2) of the Treaty, the Commission will take in consideration his comments on the question #as well as the observations of the Parliament during the debate.
In the last years, because of #european politics and to politics of the successive governments, have lost 6.000 places of direct work in the siderurgy, 6.000 places of direct work in the *minería, 10.000 small agricultural exploitations, have lost places of work in the manufacture of arms and have lost places of work in the naval sector.
The title says «Situation in the *Egeo», and the author of the text in a #ours document, of the European Parliament, presents to the islands of the *Egeo, integral part of the #greek territory, in accordance with the international treaties, like a region #whose sovereignty contested  #Grecia and *Turquía. To show  it more clearly to *usted, lady.
In view of that we do not have #all the possibilities wished to allow to this world-wide agency succeed -of course, will take all it possible for *ello, but the other have to *seguirnos-, have decided to elaborate simultaneously a plan of action #european against the doping and this time will have #all the freedom to fulfil with our obligations.
Without embargo, *cuando there #be a clear conflict on purpose of the norms of the competition, but the federations engage  to use the bottoms collected for *dedicarlos to the education and the social action in the sport, #some practical #can remain *exentas of the norms of the competition.
I believe that we have to be extremely accurate with this subject in the Summit of *Helsinki. And *ello because it #can take  a *constatación related with the question: the *constatación that *Turquía with his political path sample not comprising that a narrower relation with *Europa happens by the satisfaction of determined requirements, the requirements that have been fixed in texts and resolutions of the European Union.
Regarding the Letter of Rights Fundamental, is important also that it #can no only expand the rights that today already are established in letters and treaties, but also recognise rights of the social and economic spheres, and especially that it was innovative and creative in the sphere of the new rights related with environmental questions and with the protection of the rights of the consumers.
Finally, gentleman President, also support it *cuando pretends that they approve  the strategic lines established in the conclusions of the Council of *Tampere, in particular in the fight against the traffic of drug and expect that the #portuguese Presidency was available to approve in the next semester his plan of action.
It #can take a list of countries to the that, in the bottom, *les #would interest and #would wish to go in to form part of this *Europa *confiriéndole afterwards a distinct nature of it that is not: *Europa is not a treaty *aduanero, is not a zone of *librecambio; *Europa is a union of countries and by #this the have called European Union.
Like this, in my city of *Lyón, a young historian without resources and to the that *yo did not know, the Mr. *Plantin, has been condemned by the simple offence to having mentioned, like bibliography, in a scholarly review that edits, dramas that rectify historical errors to the that no longer it adheres  any serious historian, was *cual went his orientation.
It has invoked  against *él *ora the law on the publications that corrupt to the youth, that #can find other fields of application, *ora the law of the communist French *Gayssot, that forces, for example, to follow attributing to the Germans the slaughtering of thousands of #polish officials in *Katyn, in spite of that the #soviet recognised *haberla committed.
Against, without embargo, of it that defend the Council and the Commission on the progresses of the democracy in *Turquía -to judge by which seems that said progresses happen in the first place by the businesses of the multinationals-, the reality *nos shows of the most graphic mood that has registered  an impairment of the situation.
#If it is like this, *yo *me ask how explains  that somebody like *Akim *Birdal was in favour that we adopt a new strategy, how explains  that other #turkish representatives are likewise in favour that we adopt a new strategy and how explains  that #all the contrary opposition to the Government and also the civil society are in favour that we adopt another strategy, #if #this only represents a measure of support to the Government.
#If the initial goal was the to reach that the public have easily access to an information updated, the speaker goes more far when requiring no only the frequency of the facilitation of information, but also the diversity of media to the that resort to spread said information and is not *poca thing.
The strategy is definitely consistent, since it knows  that around the half of the total broadcasts of CO2 are associated to the traffic of vehicles, but also is precise to consider that roughly a 12% of the total of broadcasts of CO2 generate  in the European Union, whereas the rest of the world issues a 88%.
Personally, I believe that the commission of *Helsinki #can offer the guidelines, in addition to for his own main function, or was, the protection of the half marine, also for the execution of the program of the Diary 21 and, probably, for the coordination of plans regional rational.
Nevertheless, this agreement of the Council of ministers has produced an important unrest among the producers of the rest of the countries, specifically *España, #Italia and #Grecia, that really are very competitive in the transformation and in the production of tomato.
From the point of sight of the citizens, it essential is not it that last the possibility of the optional use of #one or another coin, but during how much time the banks will accept the conversion of the old coin in the new euro of free form.
The fact to underline the importance that the decisions base  in data and scientific studies and technicians is fundamental, did not concerns so only to the common organisation of the market of the products of the fishing but also to the general management of the fishing.
We support the common organisation of the markets and the strengthening of the organisations of producers, but have problems, first of all, regarding the risk that the costs see  unnecessarily increased, and also regarding the concrete form in that here it is fixed the age of intervention, although we recognise that it has to be greater.
. (GIVE) The *socialdemócratas #danish in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the proposal of *codecisión relative to the *preparativos of the meeting of the European Council in *Helsinki the days 10 and 11 December 1999, since in general we agree with the recommendations of the proposal regarding the important subjects in matter of employment, environment, enlargement, etc. that appear in the agenda.
We follow thinking that the Bosses of State and of Government have to fix in the first place a realistic agenda that take possible to close the governmental conference before the end of the year 2000, of #such form that do not arise relative obstacles to the Treaty for the next enlargement of the EU.
The text says like this: "take upsetting in that the development of the *PESC has to base mainly in the principle that the conflicts and the crises have to be warned and handled with civil and peaceful means and that the military means only have to use like last resource, having to #this be sufficiently protected by a mandate of the UN or of the *OSCE, and without that it mean increase of the military costs."
Since #this is a very sensitive question and place that finish to return of *Turquía of a brief trip of the parliamentary delegation, wanted to *pedirle an explanation, lady Speaker, and, in concrete, especially taking into account that already there #be had a time agreements that the European Union is a #christian community.
Gentleman Commissioner, *Europa also has contributed to *ello overloading the agenda with subjects that swims had to see with the international trade and offering #one *coartada to the one who had special interest by *ralentizar the process of integration of the world-wide markets: an interest that surely, repeat, was not neither the of the #european consumers neither neither of the #indian workers or *paquistaníes.
No only it will favour the democratic transparency of the *OMC, but that will help to provide a continuous link with the no governmental organisations, and besides will favour the gradual evolution of the no commercial subjects of the agenda.
Gentleman President, lamentably, as already it has said , the balance of *Seattle has not been especially positive. The only true leading were the demonstrators that, in spite of claiming #a lot of fine reasons that #can share  perfectly, thought, *equivocándose, that the failure of the Summit #can represent of by himself/hisself a victory, a solution to the grave problems posed.
In said elections #some candidates presented his candidature so much to the European Parliament as to the national Parliament and, besides, #some candidates were potential members of the future Government *luxemburgués, it that, in accordance with the section 1 of the article 6 of the quoted Record of 20 September 1976, is incompatible with the quality of deputy to the European Parliament.
We do not go to achieve that it leave  to use the bromide of methyl for shortening the terms; rather we run the risk to go in in an unwanted dynamics of *incumplimiento and fraud that goes to give a contrary result to the wished by #all.
The European Union, as it has said  this afternoon, has to be to the avant-garde, without embargo, in matter of recovery of the coats of ozone in the stratosphere, #as well as of containment of the effect *invernadero, the result do not measures  by the step of *Europa but in the context of a global vision.
The decision to award to *Turquía the statute of country candidate to the adhesion is, definitely, a political gesture bear with the #turkish diet, although *Turquía has not taken it more minimum to fulfil the known requirements that #the same EU has imposed.
This decision encourages to the #turkish diet to continue violating the human rights, to follow forward with the genocide of the village *kurdo, with the occupation of the 38% of the #cypriot territory, to follow projecting his territorial pretences in the *Egeo.

From the beginning of the crisis of the meat of *vacuno, the deputies of the Scottish Nationalist Party of the Parliament have defended *insistentemente an evaluation by separate of the situation in *Escocia, with seen to the staggered resumption of the export.
With regard to the question of #if it produced  a delay or #if the procedures will carry  in last instance in front of the courts later of it that #would have taken  according to the procedure of notification official, have to say that the first letter that sends the Commission demands usually an answer in the term of two months.

Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0099/1999) of the Mr. *Murphy, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position of the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establish  measured of fight against the *morosidad in the commercial operations (8790/1999 - *C5-0125/1999 - 1998/0099(*COD))
To finish, still wanted to express, of #the same mood, my gratitude to #all the attendants of the Commission of budgets, that have had to act really during days followed, giving the thanks to the same time to #all the Parliament and especially to my own Group by his firm and *vigoroso support in #all the stages of this subject.
Finally, I want to underline that in the modern conception of the study of the consequences of the penal trial, the pity has to have a function *reeducadora and allow the rehabilitation of the citizen that has  mistaken to reach that it go back to occupy his place in the civil society.
It seems that the members of the Legislative Assembly -in that #all, of course, are men- are not engaged in virtue of the Constitution of the country neither by the laws, neither by his international commitments, neither by the political will of the leaders of the country that subjected to vote the decree in question.
Gentleman President, *yo had asked the word before proceeding to the vote to say that our Group had presented a project of resolution specific on the natural catastrophes in *Francia and that, of course, are *cofirmantes of the common resolution.
Also in the reform of the structural Bottoms and of cohesion in the frame of the Diary 2000, #one of the goals of reform more important is the concentration of the help in the especially needed regions and poorer.
The authorities of Malt have introduced the VAT, but still is necessary *promulgar #a lot of new legislative norms to achieve that the legislation of Malt was in accordance with the situation in the European Union.
Now we have to respect also the committed contemplated in the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that *nos force to integrate the environmental politics in #all the process *decisorio of the European Union. The put in practice of these obligations of the Treaty of *Amsterdam by part of the distinct countries will subject  to examination in the next summits of the European Union.
Of general form, the diverse speakers of the Commission of Subjects External underline the difficulties that it will be necessary to surpass and congratulate  of the already reached advances and urge to that the reforms go accompanied of measures directed to attenuate the social consequences.
It did not fits to think in enlargement #any unless the States applicants are in conditions to add  to the only coin without that *ello comport a threat for his integrity and his condition, and are had to adhere  to avert that it worsen even more the Union with his present structure of two classes.
The obstacles that, alas, #some countries members have pretended to interpose, linking the negotiations to the solution of the question *politicomilitar that from 25 years ago tortures to the island, constitute, said was with indulgence, glide diplomatic that, without embargo,  *oponen to the philosophy of the European Union and to the of the enlargement, and that, in any case, take *peligrar his happy culmination.
The need of this strategy derives  directly of the proposals of the Diary 2000 in the that recognises  that the adoption of the *acervo environmental will require an enormous effort by part of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental, that only will be able to be possible on a long-term basis and only with some very high costs -in #that then talked  of some quantities of 100 to 120 one thousand millions of euros-.
Since the financial support of the Union only covers a very small part of the necessary means, is absolutely essential that get  to a very focused approach, effective and strategic of this process of approach.
In chamber place wish to obtain a public confirmation of the promise of the Commission to inform to the Parliament and *darle the opportunity to elaborate a report on the proposed Regulation of exemption by categories and on the orientations, before the Commission take his definite decision.
Of comparable mood to the evolution in the States Joined from finals of the last century, the authority *anti *trust of the European Union has evolved in the last years until converting  in the tip of spear of the European Union.
Yesterday, during the vote on my report and the report of the Mr. *Chanterie, the Mr. *Collins announced to the Parliament that in the gallery there was a photographer that was taking photos of the papers of #some deputies and of the lists of vote.
This year they have presented  in total 1.372, 191 more that the previous year. This circumstance shows that the citizens consider necessary the activity of the Defender of the Village to correct the presumptive irregularities that #can produce  in the administration of the European Union.
The analysis of the procedures of infringement from 1996 indicates that there #be had a minimum of 97 cases linked with requests of a total of 535 cases referents to direct complaints concerning the *cuales the Commission sent letters of official notification, initiating of this way the procedures of infringement.
Gentleman President, the facts have repaired the honour of this man, but the Commission considers still necessary that the disciplinary procedure continue and, besides,  *le has relieved of his competitions in the control of the finances, field in the that, without embargo, has made a work stood out.
Lady Of #Esteban #Martín, *permítame take a subsection and express my sincere gratitude to the Mr. *Newman by the help that *nos has provided to #all with his example; because in the fifteen years that has been to the service of the European Parliament, *nos has helped even more in the operation, and no only in *él, of this commission.
Possibly it #can find a solution, so that the committee of directors general yield the execution of the program to a committee delegated -therefore, really there #would be two levels inside the committee-, but the general directors continue being managers.
Before the Summit of *Berlín, especially *Alemania and the Low Countries doubted concerning the quantity of the sum, without basing, by it other, the doubts regarding the content. *Alemania And the Low Countries are really essential in the work of the #european administrations of customs.
It wanted to go back to appreciate to the commissions, the speakers and the Parliament in general the enormous and constructive work made in this so concrete terrain that *reviste, to #the same time, a big symbolic importance, #as well as concrete, for the operation of the European Union.
To *ello adds  that, by general rule, the collection of the taxes did not coincides with the utilisation of the infrastructure and the majority of the times the taxes do not adjust  to the ecological costs or the other external costs.
So much the calendar, #whose last stage finishes in the year 2004, like the creation of committees of national experts seem to guarantee a realistic application of the concept proposed, so much more what that in this way do not impose to nobody an enclosed concept. It That pretend is that the 15 States collaborate in the preparation of the solutions.
The speaker no only has worked with *ahínco on this report but that also has recognised the complexity of the question, the sensitivity that arouses this subject, and has produced a report drafted with great care that deserves the support of #all our Parliament.
Estimated lady *Schmidbauer, the recommendation of the majority *rojiverde of the Commission of Transports and Tourism that we urge to the Commission to that it include the transport deprived no commercial in the new system, of the that for the moment remains excluded, by means of the community Right -no, as it is usual, to scale national- *nos seems too much *aventurada -not even the Commission  *atreve to go so far-.
Gentleman President, the speaker of the Commission of Rights of the Woman, the Mrs. *Hautala, has tried to present an oral amendment to the amendments 1 and 2 to end to delimit the discriminations in reason of the sex that *incumben to the commissions 1 and 8.
Regarding the amendment of the Liberal, that #would delete the payment of subsidies planned in these agreements to the fishermen, the Greens the support for estimating that the fleets that fish in waters very distant do not have to perceive subsidies so important, especially *cuando pose *tantos problems the agreements to #whose protect operate.
To #the same time, the offensive of the NATO -instead of isolating to the dictator *Milosevic and his diet- is having the undesirable effect to reinforce the nationalist unit to his around against a foreign intervention.
As they see, we have treated to elaborate a wide strategy, because #one *Europa that it is able to create an only market and a common coin has to be able to find the moods and the forms to face up jointly to a problem of this *envergadura.
The *Relator special of the Nations Joined on the independence of the judicial power and of the lawyers, the High *Comisionada of the Nations Joined for the Human Rights, the International Commission of Jurists and, last night, members of the Congress of the States Joined have expressed his weigh by it *sucedido.
My congratulation is *extensiva to #all the members of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and to #all the deputies that have contributed to formulate the program and plan of action to combat the violence against the woman and the boys.
Respect a lot to #all the signatories, as to #all the deputies of this Assembly, but is responsibility of #this choose the suitable course, or well in front of the Court of Justice or well through the pertinent resolutions put that the Regulation allows #a lot of ways to express this will.
The system adopted allows *clarificarlo so that they keep  the competitions that treated  to keep exactly in the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer, and to #the same time that keep  the logical competitions in the Commission of Subjects Juridical.
*Ella *me Remembered that, in a preparatory conference that celebrated  in *Viena in 1998, the Commission of the Woman of the Nations Joined had listened especially to Europeans that manifested his pain, his suffering, the abuses, the *penalidades suffered during the dramatic nationalist confrontations in the territory of the ancient *Yugoslavia.
It #would want equally express my congratulation with reason of the conference that celebrated  in *Bruselas the past month of October under the consigns «The citizens of the third age in the century *XXI: a life by in front». To personal title, believe that it treats  of #one of the most fruitful conferences to the that have assisted since I am deputy to the European Parliament.
A chamber of the #european population is affected in these moments, and *nosotros pretend to put the self-esteem of this social group in the centre of attention so that they #can fulfil his task and his social role of the mood in that *nosotros now *nos imagine it.
Has foreseen the Commission boost the use of biofuel and *biolubricante now that the Summit of *Berlín has taken upsetting in the need to deploy an agricultural politics more forceful in the field of the no alimentary applications?
I admit that these products #can go out *algo more expensive that the conventional products, but the ecological benefits are so great that the European Commission really #would have to elaborate active proposals in this sense so that the products mentioned #can open path in the #european markets.
And, second, that the companies that have the value to follow living and producing in #Venecia with costs much higher that the other, have some fiscal helps, and that the Commission withdraw some sanctions that has begun to instruct because the #italian Government has conceded these helps.
I believe that no *nos corresponds to *nosotros go in in the debate of the experts about the specific options that they #can solve the problem of the *acqua high, but consider that it is necessary to think in #Venecia as in a zone with specific problems, in that #all help and #all care, directed to keep a viable economic context, are necessary.
It is to the light of #this that it wanted to ask an explanation, a fine explanation -have said a very fine explanation- of the Table and of the School of *Cuestores on the reasons not to allow the exhibition that *yo had invited and to the that previously had given  permission.
Yes I know that the Socialist Group has delivered a very short text with only some questions and maybe the #others texts offer the possibility to modify it a bit but, President, do not understand why suddenly postpones  to the Tuesday *algo that we #would have to have taken already the past week.
To #mine request has drafted  a report in the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects on the taxes of productivity and the green taxes and of *él gives off that, #if it introduces  this type of taxes to #european level, #can have great effects for the employment.
Without some coordination of the economic politics more general, the monetary politics will not have neither the efficiency neither the vigour that want that have, of #such luck that the coin of the European Union exert his true paper.
In the report of the Court of Accounts there #be, certainly, a series of comments negative about the execution of the budget -on #some will talk immediately- but #would be a lightness #if they attributed  only to the Commission the deficiencies that have produced .
*Me Encourage, in consequence, the wish and the hope -the certainty, #would say- that with the structural changes already in course in the organisation and operation of the Commission, will be easy for the next Parliament -that will have the support of the Commission and will not have to confront to it that *nos have confronted *nosotros the last three years- receive explanations and find solutions.
The Commission keeps the position that to the deficiencies of procedure criticised by the Court of Accounts #can put  *coto establishing a minimum grade of competition, especially, in the procedures of the public contests and in the procedures of adjudication.
The Commission has understood that the to adopt clear decisions and strictly political that tie the hands of the new Commission in a moment in that the Commission has resigned is a question that has to consider  attending to the particular circumstances of each case.
Finally, it wanted to underline that, since the institutional calendar and the political circumstances take to coincide the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with the renewal of the Parliament and of the Commission, will have to be both institutions renewed the that take the dialogue on this matter with the Council.
*Sir *Brittan, in the field of the drugs fits to accept a secondary effect, in the field of the alimentary products do not has to have these secondary effects, and here has to take the investment of the proof so that #that that produce and wish to apply these means have to show his *inocuidad.
We do not have to fear by a negative budgetary reflection because fix in the reduction of the VAT in the crop of the ornamental plants. The sales went up so much in my country that the arks of the state collected 340 millions more.
The Mrs. *Peijs *me has asked flexibility in the sense to achieve the result it more quickly possible and, therefore, interpret the paradoxical appeal and precisely in the sense of not admitting the amendments that #would not take another thing that *ralentizar the process.
I have to remember that, for example, even the exceptions based in the article 27, that in the bottom are disposals of application and no a new legislation, require the unanimity; I have to remember the great difficulties that are finding regarding the Committee of the VAT that, by his nature, is merely *aplicativo, although the States members resist  to that it happen a norm by qualified majority.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman candidate President of the European Commission, *Señorías, the resignation of the salient Commission has left very clear first of all that it is necessary a balance of powers more democratic among the Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
We #would have appreciated that this availability had been clearer takes some months, *cuando, for example, tackled  the Statute of the deputies to the European Parliament or the technical and statutory terms in the *cuales had to vote to the President of the Commission.
It #would wish to signal that the small countries neither have any privilege regarding this question, by it that #would have to demand  that the States members smaller, that have a member of the Commission, recognised that the women also have experience and are qualified, #as well as that it is possible to find candidates to occupy a square in the Commission.
Finally, I want to require that the improvement of the production and of the commercialisation of the honey, that went object of my report on the regulation *ad *hoc and in the frame of the *cual have obtained 15 millions of euros to the year, although *yo had requested 65, raisin by a high level of requirements in matter of quality, of control and of labeling of the honey.
The debates that it has been surrounded the denial by the Parliament of the approval of the management of the Commission in the budgetary exercise 1996 of the European Communities have had the political consequences that #all know.
Also we receive with satisfaction #all the steps that is giving the UN and urge to the President of the Council to that it begin at last to give steps, after the experiences of *Bosnia and of *Kosovo, so that it proceed  to adapt at last the Letter of the Nations Joined of the year 1949 to the real circumstances.
*Me Gathered with numerous political representatives of the Government and of the opposition: the president of the Parliament, Mr. *Ginuisynis, the minister of Integration European, Mr. *Lakori that pleads by the association of *Albania to the European Union, and the boss of the opposition, Mr. *Berisha.
#This is the first time that a regional alliance of nations takes part in defence of the human rights, to reestablish some stable conditions in a zone of *Europa that is living from eight years ago a reaction in chain of attempts of this type and always by #the same reasons.
The world-wide organisation to the that before has taken  reference has *fracasado, without embargo, completely, since it has not known *insuflar life to his Letter and to the International Right, but that in big part have remained reduced to dead letter, and neither has prevented the conflicts, that is the end for the that in fact it was created.
And to finish, the last question, in the situation in that now *nos find, gentleman President, #can *decirnos #if the Council is conscious of the urgent need to develop, in the frame of the Alliance, of course, a capacity of #analysis and a capacity of defence that are ideal for *Europa?
It That *le #can say is that the Commission, at least from the point of sight humanitarian, #as well as #all the humanitarian agencies, have not been informed by the States members, although in addition to seating  in the Atlantic Council take it in the European Union.
Since the President of the Council has initiated today the debate asking where find  the political solutions, *yo wanted to add a complementary question: how it has taken  in the last years of the prevention of the crises, of the preventive measures?
As well, the reservation is a typical pure instrument and hard of international Right public, and the juridical instrument chosen by the Council to dip of *rondón #that *descomunitarización, this differentiation, this discrimination among the #european members of parliament is, precisely, the reservation.
#If we accepted the project of the Council and the amendment of the liberal, instead of the text elaborated in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens under the direction of the Mr. *Rothley, *nos #would be *desautorizando again in relation with a decisive subject and that *nos affects directly.
In wait of a decision to the *respecto in the course of this year, the Commission of Budgets has assigned appropriately a reservation of 60 millions of euros and has created a reservation of personnel for the increase of the administrative work that #this goes to suppose.
Now that the European Parliament aspires to debug the European Union and exert with responsibility his function like budgetary authority, *me results personally problematic the fact that 490 civil servants of the European Parliament go to benefit  of a promotion in the year 2000.
But, gentleman *Jarzembowsky, results cynical that *usted, that has tried #everything to avert that it got  to a regulation and that has tried #everything to avert that they include  external costs for example in the taxes of toll or in the *gravámenes for the use of determined infrastructures, now take as #if this agreement went too much low and did not adapt  to the situation of the environment.
For example, the credits of commitment do not contain an explicit disposal to include the external costs in the *gravámenes existent, although it allows, and in #some cases demands, the differentiation of the *gravámenes existent with the purpose to reflect the environmental look and other effects.
Finally, I have to applaud the allusion that takes  to the cards of credit, because truly there #be had in *ellas an enormous abuse, and believe that the amendment to the *respecto, that is the 25, has to carry with #all rigour, since without signature, simply with retaining a number of card, give  abuses that #all know and, therefore, in this point it is necessary to be very rigorous.
But, besides, it is necessary to remember here that the norms of execution *hipotecaria subject  to the competition of the courts of the place in that it situates  the well, and have to remember to the *respecto the article 16.1 of the Agreement of *Bruselas of 1968 that, obviously, the community Right has to respect, and has to respect, in definite, gentleman *Whitehead, for the good end of the interests of the consumers.
Therefore, I will insist in that the #european building is a juridical construction, a construction in Right, and or have the lawyers, in general with the persons of the Right, like belt of transmission among the rules and the social reality or badly will go the #european construction.
So that the amendment 61, that introduces a right to renounce to the right to obtain information before the celebration of the agreement means that the Commission has to refuse the article 11, had account that establishes that the consumers #can not renounce to the rights that *les confers the directive.
Finally, I expect that the Parliament contribute with his collaboration to guarantee a fast approval of the current proposal that ensure the continuity among the program of action community at present in course and the program proposed that will go in in vigour on 1 January of the year 2000.
I have to admit that in the *segunda reading of the Managerial frame agreed with the Council in that the Directive mark was not the correct frame for the disposals of the relative specific directive to the level of *pesticidas in the *potitos, although of course also was totally in accordance with the Mrs. *Breyer in the need that the *potitos were free of *pesticidas.
I am -and my Group also- very satisfied with the result of the procedure of conciliation, since in the course of the procedure of conciliation accepted  this principle, of course no like integral part of the procedure of conciliation, but politically like part of the negotiations.
Now only we #can expect that the producers of the EU effect a fast change in the production of foods for babies and small boys, because a thing is clear: the feeding of babies and small boys has to be free of any poisonous substance.
Now, in the frame of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, is possible the simple rejection by part of the Parliament *cuando *nos *oponemos to a text in place of a rejection in two simpler -stages, easier and plants to the Parliament in a stronger position.
It recognises the practical that the negotiations do not carry out among 15 and 15, but in a more reduced group: the president and speaker of the competent commission with the President of the Council and the Commission, informing later to the Committee of Conciliation in plenary.
It will say  that the subject do not has depth, but these subjects are sensitive in communities that are suffering a restructuring, as it treats  of a village that carries four years trying that the debugger of waters residual of the zone in the that *ellos live put  2 or 3 kilometres more down to avert the bad smells.
In this sense, will have to receive the supports and the necessary means. Second, the Union will have to occupy to define a true strategy, a strategy of group for the stability in the *Balcanes, and Colony will be a key moment in this road.
The Council of Ministers of Finances will subject to the European Council a report on the international financial architecture, the #asian and #russian crisis have *evidenciado the need of reforms in this field.
It has taken well the Council in proposing quickly the Presidency of Roman *Prodi, but #all know -and finishes it to say the Mr. President *Santer- that exists the problem of the need to reinforce and define the political paper of the Commission.
I create -and already I am talking in name of my Group- that in front of the options that poses, for example, the self-evident of the Prime ministers of Big *Bretaña and *España, #Tony *Blair and #José *Mª *Aznar, that means more deregulation and more *flexibilización, *nosotros #would opt by a #italian frank-proposal, with a relaunching of the active politics of employment and a relaunching also of the public investments.
I believe that, #if we achieve to give priority to the idea of a constitutional pact and of citizenship, has to mean before that swims a political will reinforced of political integration, of *superación of the nationalism -and *permítanme remember it here in a moment in that it goes back to *prender the war in the *Balcanes-, our path has to be the of the integration, because, as it said here *Mitterrand, «the nationalism is the war».
The costs for the EU of 15 members until the 2006 will rise to 686.000 millions of euros, keeping to a real constant price, is to say, that for the first time it that have already reached in the States members, budgetary discipline and discipline of strict costs #as well as limitation of the growth of the budgets in function of economic prescriptions, reach it now also to #european level.
I have voted against of the proposal of the Mr. *Rothley because I regret that we have not collected the document of the Council. We have left to happen of long the big opportunity to have at last to finals of the legislative period a Statute of the deputy.
The European Parliament has lost an opportunity without pair to resolve a fundamental question for his prestige and dignity, in a moment, besides, in that  debate and demands  in *Europa the transparency and the efficiency in the operation of #all the community institutions.
From it takes long, a majority of this Parliament  *parapeta after the fault of initiative of the Council in this subject for *excusar his fault of will to see how goes out forward an only statute of the #european deputy.
In effect, in accordance with #some national statutes, existed a discrimination of assignments among the #german deputies, #whose flourishing economy allows some noble parliamentary assignments and the #portuguese colleagues, #whose modesty of the economy comported some parliamentary assignments equally modest.
The Group of Independent by the *Europa of the Nations exhorts to the #european managers to keep this embargo of the *STB, that is a hormone produced by bacteria genetically modified and alters of clear way the health of the livestock *vacuno and of way very #likely the health of the persons that the consume.
The result of 525 votes goes to impress to the Commission of #such mood that goes to keep the prohibition of the hormones and goes *reiniciar the conflict in the signpost of the *OMC to show clearly that we do not want to impose to our population this dangerous meat treated with hormones.
The reports of the Mr. #Spencer *nos show that the European Union begins to affirm  like political power and express with clarity the idea that the self-evident European Parliament the will to contribute his contribution in this field.
It is precise to add the decision of the Congress of States Joined to develop, under some conditions, a system of defence antimissile that, from the point of sight #russian, #would put in cloth of trial the Treaty *ABM».

Going back to my recommendation for the *segunda reading on the granting of helps financial community in the field of the networks *transeuropeas, this work has carried out of compliance with the ancient Treaty and now recognises the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Only like this it understands  that the initial proposal of the Commission, that already of by himself/hisself supposed a reduction of the structural Bottoms and of cohesion with regard to the levels of the current period, have seen  diminished with the final agreement reached in the European Council of *Berlín.
Gentleman President, *le ask pardon because I do not have the Regulation, but my question of order refers  to #if we have abandoned the practice that used up to now in the turn of questions, according to the *cual, after a question formulated by a deputy, and after the answer of the Council, other deputies have right for it that calls  in groins a *follow *up .
It underlines  that the foods and the medicines depend officially of the diet of the sanctions imposed to the *Iraq after the invasion of *Kuwait, but the bureaucratic structure of the system of supplies and the limited income that obtains the country of the legal sales of oil restrict the imports.
It is the President in #willing exercise to recognise that the program «oil by foods», although *loable, comports #a lot of deficiencies of type bureaucratic and collateral sanctions, and that follows without *suplir the needs of the boys, whereas his parents #can take very little to put end to the inhuman dictatorship of *Sadam *Husein?
It is intention of the Presidency adopt a definite decision on this proposal in the Council of Ministers of Fishing that will celebrate  in June. The previous condition for *ello is that until then it have concluded in the Parliament the training of an opinion to the *respecto.
All  *resume to the fact that, apart from presenting a proposal of resolution in the 55ª Meeting on the Human Rights in Gin, in the that declare #which was #ours position, have not gone back to take at all from then, because we follow without the lower information on the 598 men and the seven #kuwaiti women that were sent to prisons *iraquíes.
To the equal that the *Europa *librecambista, the *Europa of the big only market has *mentido, had not said that it treated  of the *Europa of the 20 millions of unemployed, of the 50 millions of excluded; and the *Europa *ultraliberal is *mintiendo, do not says that in the perspective of the year 2006, will be the *Europa of the taxes and the *Europa of the #european tax on the income.
This granting, gentleman Minister *Funke, the take today with satisfaction although the fishing is a relatively feeble branch of the #european economy and needs a specific treatment, #all time that the zones that depend of the fishing in his majority *carecen of places of alternative work.
In this order of things, have very clear, as it occurs in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, that any adaptation or update of the juridical acts will not be able to comport modifications of the essential elements of the juridical act original.
*Cuando Write  the history on the evolution of the social politics and of employment, a time that have abandoned my charge in the Commission, the period 1993-1999 will stand out like an important period of changes, of approaches advanced and of support to the modifications of the Treaty.
The approval of the report that debate will reinforce our political position and *nos will allow to use this instrument to take the follow-up of the negotiations in political matters, social and economic that includes, and very especially, the relative section to the democratisation and to the human rights.
It wanted to request, therefore, that present  a proposal according to the article 286 that foresees the creation of an organism of surveillance. Besides, I ask a proposal in the frame of the *tercer *pilar for the protection of the personal data, since in #that *pilar still do not have a guarantee in this sense.

Gentleman President, takes a moment, *cuando have requested, taking use of my right in application of the article 129, the return to commission of the Report *Colom *i Naval, the president *Samland *me has questioned *deplorando my absence of the meeting of the Commission of Budgets, the Monday at night.
I add, on the other hand, that *yo had assisted to the previous meeting, the that mentions the report, the meeting of 29 April, and that had voted against of the Report *Colom *i Naval, that has not modified  too much in the meeting of the commission of the Monday at night.
The Bottom of Cohesion has been created, specifically, to favour the adhesion of #some States members to the only coin: the community manna attributed  to be able to bear the diet of reduction budgetary imposed by the criteria of *Maastricht.
This disastrous evolution, contrary to #all the guarantees that  *nos had given to the start of this war, and contrary to the humanitarian goals of the own war, #can not but increase the doubts that had expressed from the principle on the strategy used.
But, #if well it has remained clear in this agreement that for the first time -and it is necessary to congratulate to Indonesian thus- it recognises  the right to the free determination and the independence in *Timor, want to stand out -and it is necessary to stand out this look, because it is an important political change of the situation of *Timor Oriental that sincerely receive with *beneplácito- that has to take into account also #any hypocrisy of behaviour already tackled here.
We have to elevate our voice, expose our arguments with greater firmness and resolution without showing never -and it is necessary to take upsetting in this point- an attitude of superiority moral, but that we have to share our points of sight in our condition of friends concerned and committed.
I do not know #if #any time has served for *algo, but take to know to my successors and to his successor and to the successor of the Commissioner that #this is the only half so that the European Parliament leave *traslucir that also feel *algo by the persons that are out of this Parliament, out of *Europa and that *nos concern by *algo more that the wage and the pension of #one same.
In the first place, they follow keeping his law of security internal that, against of #all usual conception of the human rights, allows that they are detained the that express peacefully some so much religious opinions like politics that are argued with the of the Government and that  *les *deniegue a representation *letrada suitable or even a just trial.
The ratification of the Statute of the Court, without exclusions to the operation of #this, #would show that the commitment with the fulfillment of the Right, with the defence of the freedoms and of the human life, are objective of the Union so *prioritarios at least like the commercial.
The office of the Commission in the *Comoras follows of wall the evolution of the situation and, according to the last informations, #this is of calm and the army has boarded the first contacts for the establishment of a Government of transition according to the celebrated Agreement in *Madagascar.
The proposal of resolution of the Council on the legal interception of the telecommunications no *incide in the national Right. We have to *conformarnos with this state of things, *nos enjoy or no, since it is #this the character that *revisten the resolutions adopted in the field of the *tercer *pilar.
Lady Speaker, on 15 March of this year, presented a question by writing to the President of the Parliament on a statement that #this had taken on the place of work of *Luxemburgo and the headquarters of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament.
Lady Speaker, lady Commissioner, the textile sector and of the #european preparation is seeing  gravely affected in these moments by the massive imports to prices abnormally low pertinent of economic zones that cross a deep recession or that have seen closed the markets to the that directed usually his production.
Our goal was to prepare the structures and procedures of the Union for his transformation of a Western European Union in a Union of #all *Europa, endowed at the same time also of capacity of performance in the field of the External Politics and of Security, which has to suppose likewise that it was a more democratic Union.
Afterwards it imposed simultaneously both names to the President of the Commission, to his President designated. With this performance, the #german Chancellor did not loan any service neither to Roman *Prodi, neither to the #european institutions, neither to the Federal Republic.
*Yo *le Wish, gentleman Minister of External Subjects, that in the future know to answer to this confidence in the stability and in the reliability of the #german #european politics, because #this is important for the progress of the European Union and for the future of our #european continent.
Lamentably, the Council has not promoted of way equally consistent the institutional decisions, #if well we have to express our special gratitude to the Minister of Subjects External *Fischer, precisely in this context, by his important initiatives and his important work.
Gentleman President, the Presidency of the European Union finishes to happen of #german hands to #finnish hands, by it that goes being hour to take an analysis on the past semester and, besides, hour to issue a trial about the #german Presidency.
Therefore we regret that the #german Presidency have not taken in account the recommendation of the European Parliament to the Council to make a pilot study directed to the creation of a civil contingent of peace.
*Yo Believe that, with the approval of the Diary 2000, reached to put of agreement to #that that had taken his currency of the unfair and selfish "*I *want *my *money *back' »and to #all #that, championed by the Government of my country, that believe that the European Union is a political project #where the cohesion and the solidarity are fundamental pieces.
Gentleman *Fischer, #if in *algo have agreed #all the orators that have taken part this morning has been in saying that the summit of Colony did not constitutes a base for a reform of the institutions of the Union.
In this context want to underline with #all clarity it following as continuously it talks  of the politics of security: #this did not consists in a militarisation of the European Union but in taking into account #all the instruments of the politics of security and in taking it that #can take  *preventivamente.
*Le Ensure, without embargo, that will not be the change of the number of the General Directions, the fact that they identify  by a name and no by a number, the fact that the Commissioners are disseminated by #all *Bruselas or that reinforce  to the spokesman, it that *acercará the Institutions to the public, to the that *usted referred .
To achieve a democratic structure will have to change along the years so that the Parliament was not the servant of the Commission but that the Commission was the servant of the elect representatives of the #european electorate.
We support fully a strategy that splits of the *convencimiento that it is essential to respect the Pact of Stability and share the idea that today the fundamental question is to convert to *Europa in a more competitive system to restart the path of the development with regard to struggling against the unemployment.
It is an indisputable reality that the confidence of the citizens in the system of taking of decisions will not be recovered without a reform of the procedures, and #this applies  to #all the institutions: to the Commission, to the Council and to the Parliament by equal.
In it that concerns to the #finnish posture, has remained very clear that, regarding the process of enlargement, it is necessary to take very seriously the questions related with the environmental protection and with the security of the citizens in the frame of the development of *Europa.
The total budget of the humanitarian help for *Kosovo and the neighbouring countries rises to 378 millions of euros, constituting the central points the delivery of foods of vital importance and other sakes #as well as medical help, sanitary facilities and accommodations.
On 13 July it gathered  the managerial group of high rank, the guild for the coordination of the help of the international donors in the frame of the crisis of *Kosovo, headed by the European Commission and the World-wide Bank.
On my part I want *centrarme in two points: having present the future of the Union, the most important tasks of the Council are, on the one hand, the enlargement and, by the #another, the development of the system of taking of decisions of the Union. These two goals articulate  among himself/hisself.
In this Parliament expect and wanted to act so that the reconstruction carry out in the respect and the valorisation of the human resources and of the dignity of each #one of the parts involved in the conflict and no by means of the colonisation of *Europa, of the World-wide Bank of the States Joined.
Like this it prays the article 125 of the Penal Code Turkish that, as it manifested here in *Estrasburgo by the #turkish ambassador Mr. *Kaleli, is a calque of the article 241 of the Penal Code Italian, *promulgado in the fascist and still valid period.
A question that has not mentioned  in the debate is that this same year has to take  a big review of #all the legislation on telecommunications and that the Commission already has initiated part of this low work to the mandate of the Mr. *Bangemann.
But, #if even then it results necessary to be more specific on #which are the consequences of the honesty and the discretion -and am conscious to be *supeditado to the fact that this subject finds  now in front of the Court-, *me cheer that the Assembly receive *favorablemente the changes that will produce  like consequence of the initiative adopted by the President designated.
In addition to the already published legislative program, have to *agradecerle to the Commission the constant informative task that has carried out with third countries and in particular with the World-wide Organisation of Trade, #as well as the explanations on the performances of the Community to solve the crisis of the dioxin.
Frankly I do not know, because *carezco of technical knowledges, himself/hisself #all the range of oils vegetal recyclable that now contemplate like source of risk #would have to subject to a total prohibition, or #if simply they #would have to catalog like *algún type of culinary residue without any links with the animal alimentary chain in first instance.
I estimate that the fact to having established a structure decentralised and flexible to improve his efficiency is a very important element, an element that, without embargo, has to situate in the perspective of a more global evaluation.
To difference of the Mr. *Ford, that represents to the Southwest, but supports to the *Manchester *City, *yo no support to any club of football, but yes support the right of the #european citizen to be protected against the discriminatory practices and the abuses of a dominant position.
That the Commission resorted to the Office of Assistance Technical to escape to the budgetary control. That in the costs of management conjoint, the Commission and the States members refuse reciprocally the responsibilities.
A complete review of the politics of personnel goes to take place and goes  to concentrate particularly in the feeblest areas identified by the report and in other places #such as the rigorous report of the own Commission, especially in the recruitment, discipline, professional promotion and training.
I confess that, when seeing the product that *nos rids the Committee of Experts Independent, do not dissipate  my initial doubts on #if his nomination did not mean in the bottom a true recognition of inability of our own functions of control and of political orientation.
In fact, the opinions of the Experts put of self-evident that in *Europa need a new culture of the responsibility and wanted to add, gentleman *Kinnock, that precisely in relation with this point #would be stimulating to continue the audiences of the past week as in it that to definition and clarity refers  need to follow being elaborated #some things of the audiences that have remained little clear and of the that *nos #would enjoy to know how go to be and how go to work in the future.
It is to say that, theoretically, it #can occur that somebody carried  #all the money of the European Community and that #if this person is carried in front of a court, a jurisdiction in the that is not *tipificado the fraud against the institutions of the European Community, this person not even #can be processed by fault of juridical foundation for *ello.
Besides it is necessary to expand the definition of pollution marine accidental to include the operational and radioactive pollution and other harmful substances, the accidental marine pollution and the operational.
The nature *transfronteriza of the half marine, that involves that the pollution of a zone #can have impact in a greater area, conducts to the need of a community frame for the cooperation in the field of the accidental marine pollution.
Share information on hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances transported by sea and on poured to the sea that have made  like part of diets of historical waste, is #one *precondición to prepare and coordinate any necessary answer to mitigate the impact of incidents *contaminantes on the environment and the human health.
Gentleman President of the Commission, from his nomination for the Presidency of the Commission and the designation of the nineteen commissioners, neither *usted same neither neither the members of the new School have *escatimado efforts to take get to the European Parliament a very clear message.
It will promise solemnly the Mr. *Prodi in front of this Assembly that no longer there will be in the Commission more documents that #can be studied in the GLASS, in the national delegations, at the side of the *cabilderos of the companies, of the journalists, but no to our side, that are the only that have been chosen by the village?
I have to *recordarle also the statement of *Copenhague on the social development that treats of form very ambitious the differences North-South and the differences in the interior of the North among poor and rich? The European Union has adopted commitments in this sense, but until the day of today #any of *ellos has kept .
The second inform of the committee of experts independent argued in the Plenary this Monday has not got, or takes very little time that has taken it, to the majority of the deputies, which *nos has prevented to take a serious study.
After the disaster of the previous experience, produces , proposes  an appreciable innovation of the that forms part the commitment to present an annual report on the state of the Union: an innovation of the form to act that we appreciate.
This request has been blocked #one and another time; *nos have seen unable to ask accounts to the distinct Commissioners, and the Conservative deputies to the European Parliament have not had more option that the of *oponerse by reasons of democratic principle to the squad *entrante of European Commissioners.
The Mr. *Busquin enjoys of strong protection, #this has reported  open and publicly in the press of my country, and in any case was personally responsible, and #this has recognised it and admitted *él same, to having presented an accounting of the party knowingly *falseada, that conducted to an illegal finance of his party.
Finally, regarding the codes of behaviour, need to know that the personal promotion will be based in the merit and that the promotion until the highest levels of the Commission comports a competition in matter of management, it that no always has been the case up to now.
We take note of the commitment of *consultarnos on the reform of the Regulation of the personnel that correct #some of the worries of the Mr. *Elles, the new responsibilities assigned to the persons that report corrupt practices inside the organisation and the need to develop new disciplinary procedures.
It wanted to take advantage of the occasion that *me offers this debate to say that, although we have kept exchanges very severe in occasions, always have appreciated his talent, his seriousness and the open and nice character of the collaboration that have kept with the Mr. *Liikanen.
The Court of Accounts experienced a significant increase of resources in the year 1999 and the total number rose in 49 employees The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions increased his staff with 10 employees in total.
The space of freedom, security and justice has to support in the solid guarantee of the respect of the corresponding rights to the realities of the contemporary societies, it that adjusts  to the open and innovative approach that wishes the European Parliament.
Also it #can  take a lot in questions of mutual recognition, but *cuando treat of the #european judicial sphere from the point of sight of the penal subjects perhaps are thinking in the possibility to operate as #if there were not juridical borders in *Europa.
The ignorance is not any virtue, although sometimes it #can be a doubtful debatable blessing, but the ignorance based in the secret #can not be accepted in a mature political system, that is the that we have to build in the *Europa of the persons and of the citizens.
On these bases, entrust likewise in that, when treating to create a common space of freedom, security and justice, inspire  in the principles of solidarity and of inclusion and do not think in making a *Europa community, peaceful and rich in his interior and impenetrable for the that *presionan from the outside, pushed by the *hambre, the war and the social needs.
#Many of *ellos are not really concerned by the enlargement of the vote by majority described, by important that #can be, but instead expect anxiously that there are progresses regarding the rights of the citizens, progresses regarding the freedom of circulation, progresses regarding #one *Europa truly integrated in the that the persons know and comprise his rights and his responsibilities.
Like this the things, *le ask that it take advantage of this occasion to convert to *Tampere in an important milestone that contribute to *Europa a true political integration, beginning by the inner security and the judicial cooperation, since it treats  of key elements of the State and, therefore, of the Community.
Without embargo, this proposition supposes a clear intervention in the fundamental competitions of the national states, in the right to conserve his juridical systems and to exert the control on the *acatamiento of the laws in his territories.
The greater problem, without embargo, is the unseen side, the connection of the crime organised, of the terrorism, of the traffic of drugs and of other activities that *nos force to follow to big distance the performance of these persons, and especially of the crime organised, without that we #can *hacerles front.
Gentleman Commissioner, #if really we wish to go in in a systematic and operative dynamics is indispensable that the Commission devote  to put order in his subjects of here until December, until the *segunda reading. Of it contrary, the year that comes will go back to *encontrarnos in #the same situation that this year, so much more what that the own Commission recognises that it #can not  foresee how will be the question of the payments in the year 2000.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, visitors, like deputy of the Basque Country wanted to believe that raise our voice and ask the intervention and the help for *Timor will be a step more to finish, no only with the slaughtering to hands of persons protected by the #indonesian soldiers, but, especially, to finish with the hypocrisy that chairs the international politics.
Gentleman President, want *sumarme to the convictions and to the words already *proferidas by the other colleagues, but want to affirm here that the death in *Timor Oriental did not get to this territory after the referendum: before *él, more of #two hundred one thousand *timorenses lost the life in front of the passivity of the international community, that observed to the village of *Timor Oriental as #if it was a village *prescindible.
More still, #if the author of the rape, gentlemen of the Council, is a democratic Government, *Señorías, in the defence of the human rights there #be not third roads neither there #be possibility to escape , not even giving an answer in this Parliament.
But we #can not leave to take into account that no only in my country, in *España, but also in the rest of the European Union, in the next years go to follow having a migratory pressure of nomadic communities, as it is the case in *España of the community of origin *rumana and of *etnia #gipsy.
According to the conclusions of the Summit of Gin, the common mission is to reinforce the capacity of the Union to take part in the crises, and no the creation of a system of defence territorial.
The European Union took for the first time an initiative, in concordance with his principles, on a project of resolution for the pity of death in the session *nº 55 of the European Commission of the rights of the man celebrated in Gin this year.
Without embargo, #can not *decirnos the President in exercise of the Council #if, in those countries with the that keep political and economic relations, as with Chinese, #can influence , keeping a clear and concrete posture in favour of the disappearance of the pity of death that so well supports this European Parliament?
Subject: Acquisition of terrains in the States candidates to the adhesion #Which is the position of the Council regarding the efforts of the countries candidates of the *Europa Central and Oriental to be able to, after the adhesion, follow limiting or forbidding the free acquisition of terrains by part of the citizens of the Union, at least during a transitory period?
The Commission, in a principle, has tried to find a solution that contemplate a system with *algún type of contingents, but has been very difficult to get to an understanding with the producing countries and with States Joined, as these countries have interests very different and refuse the system of contingents.
Second, undertakes  the open intimidation to the #yugoslav village, shattered by the criminal bombardments of the NATO, to a village that now has to subject national, social and politically and has to purchase a leadership of the like of the Americans and of the NATO to have perspectives to be able to reconstruct his *asolado country.
I estimate that it treats  of a true problem of face to treat to create a situation inside the *cual #can fulfil  the possibility to introduce in the context of the Mediterranean a more complete assessment and that first of all offer a big perspective in this sense.
In it that concerns to the rapidity, efficiency and transparency of the action of said Agency is important to treat to consider this appointment a fine occasion no only to be able to reconstruct *prioritaria and quickly in the existent situation in *Kosovo, but to try create a condition so that the problem of the migratory flows in the Mediterranean watch  with special attention.
The proposal of the Commission reflects the need to create an instrument for the fast management, decentralised and effective of the help for the reconstruction so that it take into account the urgency of the situation and the exceptional efforts that are necessary.
Before we proceed to the last vote, wanted to explain to the colleagues that have thought that perhaps I have been *algo severe regarding the votes by separate, the nominal votes, etc., that the reason that we follow the Regulation to *rajatabla is that there are Groups that prepare his whips basing in the information of the Presidency.

Like this as, no only #Grecia but also other seismic countries, have to take #all those measures of *blindaje *antisísmico necessary so that they do not repeat  tragedies like #this; because it is a fact that, although of the earthquakes #can not  take responsible to the governments and the persons, concerning the damages that #this *ocasionan, his responsibility is *tremenda, and like this have shown it the earthquakes in #Grecia and in *Turquía.
I #can imagine that the conjoint mission of evaluation, similar to the that finishes to request , that at present carry out in the zones of the disaster THROW, the representation of the Commission in *Ankara, Nations Joined and the World-wide Bank will present a more exact picture of the needs.
In the frame of the celebrated meetings with the Government *iraní the past December and in May of this year, the troika of the Union put on the table the subject of the deal that receive the members of the religious minorities in will go, in particular the of *Baha' *is.
Already it is hour to go back to the fundamental principles, to win height and trace for our *conciudadanos the perspective of the peaceful organisation of our continent, respectful of the human rights and based in a #european model of economic and social development.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Commission, the conventional agricultural production employs increasingly chemical substances, additives, *coadyuvantes, antibiotics, hormones -#can continue the list- and our alimentary industry has more the look of a chemical complex that of some facilities allocated to the preparation of foods.
The modality of the final control constitutes, in fact, an invitation to the criminal behaviours, since they take advantage of  the possibilities of adulteration, which has conducted -fits to suppose- to the systematic addition of toxic substances in the field of the production of *piensos.
The damage caused by the *sobresalto caused by the dioxin is incommensurable, so much regarding the destruction of the confidence of the consumers as to the economic consequences to having blurred the reputation of sectors industrial fundamental and creators of export.
Lady *Maij-*Weggen, *yo expect that his Group contribute to that the decisions of the Commission of Budgets of the that have had news #can be reconsidered and #can modify  in the Plenary, with the withdrawal of the cuts in relation with the proposals of the Commission of Development that now are on the table.
I believe that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the governments of the States members have to intensify his measures in matter of campaigns of information on the public health; they have to take it by means of the Departments of Health or by means of voluntary groups that so important paper exert to help to the affected by said illnesses.
And the answer, as they have affirmed the Mr. *Wurtz and other orators, has been the bureaucratic answer to reduce first of all the relative budgetary costs to the investments in the field of the AIDS.
The Council has taken a decision on this finance, but has taken it without having had available the corresponding resources and this fact is the that has called the attention of the Commission of Budgets.
The Parliament #can ascertain now that so much the Commission like the Council have taken #his to a large extent our proposals and, therefore, in my quality of speaker of the Commission of Industry, wanted to appreciate sincerely the collaboration and the spirit of cooperation that the has chaired.
The commission approved with the greater possible consensus, or was, by unanimity, the proposal to restart varied important aspirations of the amendments proposed in the first reading that were not attended by the Council, although we receive with big satisfaction -and *yo also want to manifest it here, gentleman *Langen- the wide coincidence with the Parliament.
Even so, we go to devote, for #the same annual period, sixty millions of euros for the fission in front of fifteen millions for the renewable energies, and #two hundred millions of euros for the fusion; *ello *nos gives an idea of the real politics that follows the European Union.
And it is undoubtedly through the possibility to have access to the network, to be sufficiently flexible in the proposals that take, that allow to give coverage to the distinct instruments that the distinct States members have used and that are not *homogéneos and that they are distinct, as we will be able to guarantee that the renewable energies no only keep  but that duplicate , *Señorías, in the next years.

In spite of our criticism on the attitude of the European Union, support fully the basic goal of the Agreement, to know, the economic development of *Sudáfrica and the integration of this country in the world-wide trade.
A "rich country" of #one of the poorest continents #where the social relations are still very uneven, until the point that the *PNUD classifies to this country in the place 93 by the index of development human.
For *nosotros is indispensable to know #if *Sudáfrica has adopted or no the necessary measures so that a series of denominations essential, among *ellas the of Port and Sherry, do not use  already in his exports to the European Community and, in a term of five years, see  suppressed for #all market to the export.
Gentleman *Prodi, *me fear that in this subject *usted and his colleagues have not taken into account the point of sight of the European Parliament and of numerous constituents that think that this civil servant, that has given the voice of alarm, do not deserves any reprimand, but all it contrary.
Finally, since I have talked of lessons that have to extract of this natural catastrophe, have to signal also the attention that concede - and have said it in the breast of the school - to the idea, underlined in the European Parliament, to coordinate better the means of the different States in matter of civil protection.
*Yo Want to highlight especially in this context the Commission introduced the agreements of purchase compulsory among the producers and the primary transformers and afterwards established  also the requirement of a permission for #all the companies of transformation.
In this hypothesis, is evident that today #can not know, when voting the calendar for the year 2000, #if the agenda of the partial period of sessions of November of the year 2000, for example, will be overloaded and #if it is necessary, in #such case, add a *minisesión the days 29 and 30 November, is to say, inside fourteen months exactly (more of a year).

Although I receive with satisfaction the recent commitment of *Monsanto of not commercialising the "technology of termination of the seed" , this subject is too much serious to leave it in hands of the that are directly involved and that #would have acted of another mood of have not existed the surveillance of the consumer.
The utility of the globalisation has to benefit proportionally by the same to the regions and nations of the world, #if well the interests of the European Union, of the remaining #european States, of the #EE.UU, of the other States industrialised and of the emergent countries and in roads of development have to be carried to a better balance.
And in this measure, the *OMC #can not  limit to the commercial questions; it has to also tackle fundamental questions, like the quality and *inocuidad of the foods, the animal welfare, the environmental protection and the respect of the consumers and his sensitivity.
Gentleman President, yesterday have celebrated in this same hemicycle a debate on the reinforcement of the alimentary security in *Europa, whereas in the breast of the Union have developed  the conflicts on the principle of caution, and simultaneously the North American look for reprisals *injustificadas.
The EU has converted  in an important actor of the world-wide economy by means of the integration of the #european economy, and will be only through a round of negotiations that contemplate different sectors as we will be able to guarantee the stability of the economic growth.
We have to know, with #all -said was among *nosotros-, that, in group, the balance of the application of the mechanisms that have created  after *Marrakech is totally correct from the point of sight of the Union, treating of the relation among the number of cases that have subjected and the cases won or #stray.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the next world-wide conference on the climatic changes of 25 October to 5 November 1999 in *Bonn: application of the Agreement of *Kioto.
The growth of the forests like factor *eliminador of the dioxide of carbon follows and has to follow being debated of open form, and in this debate will be able to include  also the increase of the multipurpose of the forests to contribute to the protection of the half and brake the climatic changes.
Like this as, the Council supports #all the initiatives directed to struggle against the poverty that help to facilitate information, that make possible the exchange of information and of experiences, that promote the adoption of new methods for the fight against the social marginalisation and that look for forms to evaluate the experiences had.
Now that the fight develops  in the breast of the UN it is necessary to have care with *contrapropuestas *traicioneras, that although perhaps they have an innocent appearance, come from distinct spots to weaken a taking of position forceful by part of the General Assembly of the UN.
Along these 19 years, *nos have found with numerous hits of effect to the hour to discover the truth that, as it seems, do not achieves to open path by the complicity of the one who is interested in that it do not know  despising the legitimate rights of the families of the victims and mortifying the fundamental principles of our democracies.
To be truth, the facts show that *Nietzche had reason *cuando said that the madness is *algo rare in the person, but, instead, is common in the parties, the groups and the organisations, and precisely therefore we need an individual and independent surveillance of the daily work in the nuclear plants.
It wanted to insist in that the publication of the Green Book on sustainable energy in *Irlanda has to be considered like a positive contribution to the debate on the form to occupy  of the threat that poses the climatic change, inside the energetic sector.
Lady Speaker, believe that in this concrete stage proceeds to say that they have been the conservative British, the *PPE, those who have asked that this point inscribed  in the agenda of the Friday simply because, as it has said the Mr. *Watson, the Commission will not be able to formulate his statement until the Friday in the morning.
It treats  of the personnel subjected to the statute of the civil servants and agents of the Communities, #as well as, quote, "the members, leaders or members of the personnel of the institutions, of the organs and of the organisms of the no subjected Communities to the statute" .
I do not pretend that it except  to the elect members of #all control or that are not object of any investigation referent to his activities, including the of #european deputy in the exercise of his mandate, but fear that this agreement give place to suspicions and to an assimilation airily, without perspective, as it has occurred during the last months of 1999.
It treats  of *algo so *grato for #all that in the European Union #would have to *esforzarnos for creating a suitable frame for this form of trade: A suitable frame for the mutual confidence among citizens of different countries since, after all, #if there #be *algo that do not bear mention in the borders, #that *algo is Internet.
Gentleman President, there #be not in the budget #such juridical base, and believe that #this is a grave lack, because it #can reveal, as it has revealed in the case of #Grecia, but also in other cases, a fault of sensitivity in front of the unpredictable misfortunes that #can suffer #ours *prójimo, in the that we #would have to show some generosity.
To the Commission of Fishing *le concern very especially the budgetary line *B2-901, relative to the operations of control and of surveillance made by the States members, the line *B2-903 relative to the support to the Politics *Pesquera Common, and the line *B7-8000, relative to the international agreements of fishing.
I have to give the graces besides, in name of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, to #the same time to the general speaker of the budget, gentleman *Bourlanges, and to the Commission of Budgets, #as well as to his president, gentleman *Wynn, by the position that have adopted in this question.
By #this propose that in the next period carry out an analysis of the programs, with the relative lines of credit, no longer by periods of four, five or six years, but by periods more reduced: of #one or two years at most, since the logics of market and of investment in an economy *globalizada no longer answer to the criterion with the *cual has structured  the budget.
#If the Council has not found another way to fund the reconstruction of *Kosovo that through a linear cut of the external actions of the Union, is logical that the European Parliament want to now defend these lines.
#If #all the parts interested respect the fundamental distribution of these competitions and act in consequence, the achievement of the goals of #all the areas of performance will be the natural result of his decisions of performance individual.
Finally, the debate on a "combination of politics balanced and adapted" did not have to use to divert the attention of the structural reforms that so urgently need  to face up to the grave structural problem of unemployment in the zone of the euro.
The irrational exuberance that characterises to #some bags, the excessive indebtedness of the #american families and of some economic sectors in the important countries take that it weigh a true threat on the world-wide economic stability.
The workers concern  because the Central Bank European considers a danger, for the famous monetary stability, a rhythm of growth greater that the 2,5%, *algo that carries to the fight against the unemployment to an indeterminable future.
We are keeping a debate *algo wander and results interesting to read the words of the gentleman speaker in the exhibition of reasons, is to say, that the European Parliament " ... It is responsible so much to receive and debate the annual report of activities of the #ECB as to control the #ECB" .
It wanted to signal that the Realm Joined and the Conservative Party British -to the that belong- never have been hostile to the euro like coin for those States members that really wish to join, since #all are tied as a result of our belonging to the only market, so that a sinking of the confidence in the euro #can *afectarnos to #all, are inside or out of the *UEM.
Also it is essential, in my opinion, that encourage  to the Bank to follow the example of other great central banks, like the Federal Reservation American, and to take of the transparency a fundamental look of #all his activities.
The historical examples do not are missing to this *respecto and the warning is not *ociosa in the current moments, in the *cuales the economic recovery in *Europa do not finds , neither *muchísimo less, confirmed, and in the that, to the own time, assist to speculations on the imminence of a monetary politics more strict.
Gentleman President, gentleman *Duisenberg, *nosotros the deputies, as we have manifested varied times tonight, have a fundamental paper that exert in relation with the only coin put that this Assembly is the only place in the that the village of *Europa #can exert a democratic influence in the mood in that it manages  his only coin.
The system of the Euro, to the principle, left clear during a short period of time that the provision #would not constitute a problem taking into account that it #can ensure  that the money guaranteed to the banks or to other organisations will not go in in circulation before 1 January of the 2000 - is to say, in general circulation.
The results of the application of this politics see  reflected in the notorious decrease of the complaints by rape of the human rights produced by the public strength, #such as they recognise it the reports of organisms *intergubernamentales and the *ONG that act in this field.
The Commission  *congratula of the principle of *equiparación, so wide as it was possible, of the rights and duties of the pertinent citizens of third States that reside of durable form in the Union with the recognised to the national citizens of the States members of the Union and consider that it has to advance  with concrete proposals in this sense.
In *Tampere #can not  still adopt the idea of a Public Ministry European, even limited to the protection of the financial interests of the Community. *Me Allow to propose that the next debate on the Conference *Intergubernamental was a fine occasion so that it collect  this #ours idea.
#If these decisions, when going back of the field of the high level to the grey *cotidianeidad of the councils of the Ministries of Interior and of Justice, go back  also routine and do not happens at all in three or four years, *Tampere will happen to the history like the summit of the statements *irrealizadas.
*Me Propose to consider like political and philosophical foundation of the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice #all the relative questions no only to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the States members of the Union, but also to the of the citizens of third States that reside legal and *duraderamente in the territory of the Union.
The past week have kept a debate with #Jean-*Luc *Dehaene -the gentleman Commissioner #Michel *Barnier was present- and want to *decirle, gentleman Commissioner, that have a full confidence in that *usted will make his contribution to guide the European Union to a positive future and will have #all our support in this task.
#This *CIG, without embargo, will not treat so much on expanding the field of responsibility or of competition of the European Union; it will treat on the structural reform, the institutional reform, the reform that give greater opening to the Union, that the take more efficient, more democratic and more transparent.
It is the question of the coding and simplification of the Treaties, a subject that this Parliament was the first in putting of relief in the preliminary stage of the negotiations of *Amsterdam; a task initiated by *Amsterdam, but that is far to be completed and that it is #another of the arguments in the that takes upsetting the report *Dehaene.
(The Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98/3 relative to the elimination of facilities maritime in disuse (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0015/1999 - 1999/0097(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer)
Receive with enormous satisfaction this intelligent step to cut across #one of the key problems that brake the potential of the electronic trade in *Europa, to know, the difficulty to verify the identity of the users and the consumers.
I support the proposal of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary in the that asks  that they facilitate  to the *PE succinct records of the meetings of the Council of Governors, in the that present  of explicit form the arguments "in favour" or "against" of the decisions adopted and the reasons that motivate said decisions.
The European Union believes that the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs is an important step in the path to the no proliferation of nuclear arms and to the nuclear disarmament, and his entrance in vigour results beneficial for #all the states.
As a result of the nuclear proofs made by Indian and *Pakistán, the Commission has taken part in the international operative units for the development of measures of confidence and of guarantees and so that these countries undertake constructive negotiations on the no proliferation and the control of arms in the zone.
But anyway, it is important that there #be a clear expression and *comprometedora of the political will of the international factors and of the that they #can guarantee the world-wide peace and the stability that the no expansion of the nuclear arsenals is elevated and constitutes a no negotiable priority.
*Permítanme Add some words on the finance of the military campaign that, in my opinion - an opinion that do not seems to share the Russian Prime minister - believes  that it has been able to *repercutir on the recovery of the #russian economy during these last months.
#If now, with the unanimous support of the commission contribute other 13 amendments, #this refer  in first line to the endowment of credits, to the term of application and to the requirement directed to the States members so that they suppress the obstacles in the access to the program.
Precisely *nosotros the radicals perhaps were the first in creating of autonomous form a centre of audience in the audiovisual sector attendant of the follow-up and control of the presences, for example, politics in the distinct spaces, the distinct newscasts and the media.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading(To5-0038/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [13175/1/1999 - *C5-0022/1999 - 1998/0197(*COD)] with seen to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  the program of action community "Youth" (Speaker: Mrs. *Gröner)
Is especially *inquietante the fact that, simultaneously to the reduction of the costs of support to the markets of products agricultural, assist, in the frame of the called second *pilar of the *OMC, to the systematic increase of the costs devoted to ruin to the small and average agriculturalists.
It Same fits to say of the social costs, extraordinarily limited, and oriented no to reduce the unemployment and to improve the quality of life of the workers, but to facilitate measures for the destruction of the frame of relations labour.
But wish underline that, without embargo, are not #naïve: the fact that the Parliament wish to substitute the terms "cultural cooperation" by the cultural "political terms" reveals the temptation *uniformizadora of a supposed cultural politics #european, that #would substitute the politics of the States members.
They do not take fault already neither pretexts in this jungle in the that *impera the law of the most violent competition and of the immunity of the big capital; of here that *MICHELIN announce to #the same time an increase of the benefits of the 17% and 7.500 new dismissals, that add  to the 15.000 of the immediately previous years.
Equally, it is necessary that adopt  the necessary measures to increase the rights and the conditions of intervention of the committees of company #european established in the Directive 94/95, in particular regarding the right to the suspension of the licences.
In effect, as it has been signalled aptly by the Mr. *Hatzidakis, this Directive foresees some transitory disposals, valid until 1 January of the year in course, with the end to allow the ending of some works of the European Committee of Normalisation.
The widest possible, that has to include also the cooperation *extractiva, as #if *Europa is the main market of export of the #moroccan fish, circumscribe the cooperation to the commercialisation and transformation #would not be it desirable, since the market controls  from the centres of consumption more that from the centres of production.
Gentleman President, the innumerable pressures that so much the Council and this Assembly like the sector *pesquero had to exert on the Commission have given like fruit that finally, grieve a month before finalising the Agreement of fishing with *Marruecos, have obtained  a mandate of negotiation.
Gentleman Commissioner *Fischler, three months ago that am here and already have seen it prejudice the interests of *Portugal three times: with the crazy cows, subject in the that his decision results inconceivable; in the *ganadería swine, in the that his will of persecution is unacceptable; and now in the fishing, in the that the inaction of his Commission neither has pardon.
Nobody pretends to put in cloth of trial effective instruments of cooperation with *Marruecos through negotiations that reinforce, inside it possible, the interests so much of the community operators as of the Moroccans underlining this sense of the solidarity that, on the other hand, also in the distinct sectors of the *exquisitamente economic, has shown  daily especially among the countries of the south of *Europa, in the #mediterranean zone.
On the other hand, the #european fleet so attentive to exert the fishing fulfilling the concrete norms of environmental compatibility - biological stops, fields of fishing, prohibition of fishing with *jábega and with networks of drag, #etcetera - needs socioeconomic measures of compensation after an agreement that limits even more, #if it fits, his activity, included the industry of transformation.
I do not know #if they are some, but *me have said that in the #french markets sells  meat joined still to chips of medullary and cerebral tissue: the corresponding organism #can occupy to control the too much low norms of agricultural hygiene in *Francia; the #french supermarkets do not demand the presentation of the reports on *pesticidas.
Gentleman President, comprise to our #british friends, as I comprise to our #portuguese friends, that also see  affected, as I comprised to our #belgian friends in the subject of the dioxin and as I comprise still better to the French in the subject of the slimes of debugger.
But neither it is necessary to lose of sight that the catastrophe of the illness of the crazy cows that has affected to our #british mates #would have been able to affect to #any one of our countries, since #all practise #the same agricultural politics *productivista contrary to the nature, increasingly subjected to the *librecambismo world-wide.
It will adopt measured against *Francia after the meeting of the Commission on 10 November, #if, to these heights, after having had varied days to digest the unanimous decision, the #french Government has not adopted measures to raise this prohibition?
It is a special consultative group that takes his contribution to the legally established committee, established to exert the function to advise to the Commission in relation with these subjects, is to say, to the Managerial Committee Scientist.
It remains clear in advance that the end of this dialogue in two times is not the to understand  on common orientations or commitments *apremiantes; like this, as, this dialogue will not conclude with an agreement of coordination #ex in front of of the different fiscal politics, budgetary, monetary or even contractual.
#If the community interests do not situate  in the *primer flat, the Union will not be able to carry advance the necessary politics to complete the ordination of the #european market in the sense of a social economy of market environmentally sustainable.
It That is in game is not a question of confidence or of confidentiality -that the members of parliament and members of parliament also know to respect-, but that it that in reality  *dirime is how go to configure our future in the century *XXI and in this context #can not  *escamotear any information, any analysis, any prognosis, but that all has to #make of way really affordable.
It #can the restructuring in the labour market, the restructuring and the reforms that have to take  in the markets of products and of services, in accordance with the decisions of *Cardiff, #can #all these reforms, create the conditions so that the monetary politics move  in another frame?
But I believe that we have to see the positive side politically. That it that concerns so much to the villages of *Europa -because #all the deputies represent to the villages of *Europa, by *ellos have taken use of the word in this hemicycle- by this subject *candente and interesting that is the employment and the unemployment, comes to the centre of the dialogue *macroeconómico.
The fact of not being physically seated in the table of the dialogue do not wants to say that there #be not a possibility of presence of the Parliament, a possibility to transmit his ideas.
The formulation of the common position #would have allowed simply to the *empleadores abandon the attempts to reach a negotiation on the annual computation of the labour day and then the States members #can have allowed said annual computation.
In any case, gentleman President, *nosotros support the just claims of the workers of the sea, are to his side and, in spite of #everything it positive that have these directives, #can not vote his approval because they are in a direction that, still with his possible improvements, goes to perpetuate the current inadmissible situation.
From the principle have to underline that today we are debating a modification of the relative directive to the bunch of the workers that had been excluded of the directive on the ordination of the time of work, that carries  debating six years.
Although we do not have news of cases of persecution or imprisonment of scientists by his scientific work, *yo wanted to remember that a series of scientists have been pursued or imprisoned in the last years owing to his political ideas and, to our opinion, #would have to take advantage of  also this occasion to express clearly that these persons owe *recobrar his freedom.
*Me Seems that all it that have witnessed during these last months shows it contrary: the multiplication of the arrests of #dissident, the persecution of the supposed sect *Fa-*Lung-*Dung, etc. Obviously, #can conceive  a strategic relation with a no democratic country, with a dictatorial country.
The question that imposes  is #if with the effective execution of this agreement, the #european interests will correspond  of sufficient form with the of *Moscú Concedes the #russian Government, for example, to be concrete, #the same importance that *nosotros to the situations of emergency ecological?
Have here a data that *me encourages and that it #would be necessary to project to scale of the European Union. The chemical industry German devotes 12.300 millions of annual frames to investigation and development, to the *cuales it is necessary to add other 5.000 millions of frames allocated to the investigation abroad; generally in States Joined, is true, but the countries of *América Latin and #others also take part increasingly like investors in the sector of the investigation.
The European Union has to give a direct juridical frame to allow the free circulation and the free provision of services and avert the conflicts and the obstacles to the free circulation owed to legislations too much #discordant in the distinct States of the Community.
In consequence, by reasons of procedure today has taken  necessary present two reports, #one relative to the guidelines on politics of employment for the year 2000 and the creation of a commission of employment, and another relative to the conjoint report on the employment in 1999 that contains the conclusions approved in the commission.
#This states, to his time, of two parts: in the first place, of the proposal of decision of the Council by the that creates  a Committee of Employment and, second, of the relative proposal to the guidelines of the politics of employment for the year 2000.
This regulation will guarantee fundamentally that the States members support the programs that take into account the character *cambiante of the world of the work, the need to boost the business spirit, #as well as the support to the local programs of creation of employment.
The Union #would have to be ambitious regarding the utilisation of money for the employment, controlling the public helps delivered to the companies and applying a politics of credit that penalise the destructive practices and favour the creation of employment.
I create, besides, that the report, integrated by the contributions that the Mr. *Menrad has had to well collect, is in fact the best possible report in the field of those limitations that the *márgenes of the subject, the competitions of the Parliament and the constructive modalities of *Europa allowed.
Also we receive with satisfaction the general call in favour of a fiscal review with seen to reduce the fiscal charges and the *cotizaciones to the social security, #as well as the formalities, all which increases the unemployment and weighs on the places of work.
The report inscribes  perfectly in the frame of the process of *Luxemburgo that, on my part, *yo #would have preferred that it had presented some goals in figures, and inscribes  besides in our will to know the balance that proposes the Commission for the national plans of annual employment.
It is indispensable that the workers take part in the decisions that *les affect and #if, in his moment, the Mr. *Schweitzer, president of *Renault, had consulted to the consultative committee European, created and proposed by our Assembly, definitely #would not have had the subject *Vilvorde, as perhaps we #would not have had the subject *Michelin.
Nevertheless, we have to consider that from the moment in that we recognise that the unemployment is not so only a quantitative magnitude, but also qualitative, has to expand the quantification of the qualitative parameters of the employment, that have to include references to the level *salarial, to the time, and to the special conditions of work.
The surveys that have made among the youngsters that finalise his school cycle and among the students that initiate his professional life, have given, for example, like result that the 60% of our youngsters in place to initiate an active occupation, prefer to undertake a career *funcionarial.
*Austria Has assumed a paper of avant-garde with a law of protection against the violence that exists from 1997, the designated right of expulsion, in the that the men that have *perpetrado violent actions are expelled of the home and the women do not see  forced already to have to escape with his children to houses for women and to similar centres.
In consequence, invite to the Mrs. Speaker to that it put greater attention - while it was in course a political debate in #one of the States of the Union - so much in not taking party by #one of the parts as in respecting or, at least, in taking into account the existence of the valid constitutions in the distinct States of the Union.
It is a countable system that allows a wider base of the resource *PNB and, consistently, some greater financial resources, without exceeding the relative index on purpose signalled in the agreements of *Berlín and in the agreement *interinstitucional.
Finally, in relation with the increases of the powers of management of the Commission, by means of the *cuales #this #can reduce the amount of the direct helps or suspend the payment of the *anticipos monthly to the States, estimate that it do not associates  to the Parliament it sufficient in the adoption of these measures.
The reason for *ello is that this proposal breaks with the freedom of election of the States members to the hour to regulate so much the labour day like the time of rest, as it remains established in the Agreement *núm. 180 of the *OIT on labour day of the *navegantes.
In this context has to have  of course in account that the closing of head offices nuclear *ocasiona also economic problems in diverse countries. They see  affected the supply of energy, the prices of #the same and the possibilities of export and also #can arise environmental problems #if it changes  to the old-fashioned and defective energetic plants.
The decision in relation with the hormones in the meat of bovine and his import bases  in scientific proofs -that facilitated to the Commission, before *yo occupied my place, the appropriate scientific committee-, in the sense that #one of the hormones in particular -17 beta-*estradiol- is a complete *carcinógeno.
Also it wanted to signal to the attention of His *Señoría the statement that appears in the communiqué of the Scientific Managerial Committee that the meat of bovine exported with arrangement to the plan of export according to a calendar established is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of the European Union.
The Commission remembers that the decisions adopted and the statements taken in the summit European Union-States Joined, of 18 May 1998, on the laws *Helms-*Burton and will go-Libyan went directed to prepare the terrain for a definite solution of this important bilateral disagreement.
The *UNMIK, attendant of the provisional civil administration of *Kosovo, is devoting energy and considerable resources to reactivate the economy of *Kosovo, it that comports, among other things, the *restablecimiento of a juridical and institutional frame and the coordination of the considerable quantities of assistance of donors that are sustaining the economy.
Nevertheless, because of the supplementary terms fixed for the approval of the smart -terms, finish to say it, of the that the Commission is not responsible- the approval of the programs will have to take place in the course of the second semester of the year 2000, for the greater part of these eight States members.
#That is the reason by the that are insisting a lot in the programs of cooperation judicial and police to sensitise more to the authorities -to the policemen that take  charge of these cases #all the days- on how confront this class of incidents.
#If well I recognise that His *Señorías wish to use this communication and *debatirla in the Parliament like an instrument to increase the pressure on the States members, wanted to *instarlos to that they exert this pressure now and do not limit  to expect until this document happen by #all the necessary courses in the EU.
Gentleman President, only want to issue a brief personal statement. It was not at all my intention suggest that the Commissioner has received *algo, being missing to the truth but that in the public means Czechs has said  that  *le had sent said study and that had not reacted up to now.
The three deputies of the Communist Party of #Grecia, in forceful protest by the presence today here of the Mr. #Solana -#one of the greater managers, in his quality of Secretary General of the NATO, of the crime *perpetrado against *Yugoslavia-, and by his nomination like "gentleman *PESC" , abandon symbolically the Hall.
For the first time, the Council of Subjects General gathered  with the additional participation of the ministers of Defence of the Union and kept a debate -to my trial, important- on the formulation of a #european politics in matter of security and of defence.
I believe that #that is a dimension that has to inspire his performance and, to #the same time, like Secretary of the Council, expect that *le allow to help to reform and to give coherence to this institution, that, in this moment, is perhaps the most needed of an impulse of rationalisation in the group of our institutions.
In this context wanted to mention that the network of prevention of conflicts *CPN, been born of an initiative of #Michel *Rocard in the European Parliament, alerted on the explosion of a conflict a lot before the confrontation of *Kosovo, #such as also they took it #a lot of delegations of the Parliament that visited the region.
For example, our minister of Subjects External affirmed that it felt  very happy with the decisions adopted: it said that they had taken into account the interests of the neutral countries and that #this had respected  in the opinion that presented the Political Committee of the EU.
Our approach of the negotiation has to reflect our importance like the greater commercial region of the world and at the same time also our responsibility to promote a balance among the economic interests to scale world-wide, especially in relation with the countries in development.
The model of the #european agriculture, based in agricultural exploitations environmentally sustainable, that together with the production of foods, also characterises  by the preservation of the rural space, of the environment and of the quality of our products, has to keep .
*Nosotros Want to link the liberalisation of the world-wide trade with the basic subjects of the future politics, of our future, the subjects of the social harmony and the requirements of the environmental politics.
Gentleman President, *yo only want *rogarle that *le transmit to the Speaker of the Parliament our gratitude for having received to a Government chosen under the supervision of the *OSCE, that besides has his headquarters inside the territory of the Council of *Europa and #whose election carried out of compliance with the #russian Constitution.
The absolute liberalisation of the market, the suppression of the subventions, the control by the *OMC of the negotiations on the immunity of the investments, will convert to the small countries in hostages in hands of the powerful and to the villages in instruments of the monopolies.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman Minister, *Señorías, take use of the word to reaffirm #some of the points that already have signalled here #a lot of #mine mates of the Party of the European Socialists, in the sense that we are adherents of a round of negotiations, but no a round #any one of negotiations.
We think that the development of the economy and of the competitiveness of the #european countries #can take  in a favourable frame to the modernisation of the social systems without renouncing to the fundamental requirement of the solidarity.
Gentleman President, estimated and estimated colleagues, *yo want to appreciate to the #finnish Presidency and to the Mr. *Sasi the commitment with the that have assumed the difficult task to define the mandate and express also my gratitude to the speakers by the frankly excellent work that are making.
I prefer the cohesion to the efficiency and *cuando the Commissioner *Barnier posed takes little the question that in *Europa there will be 27 countries, *yo *le say, gentleman Commissioner, that for me is more important that in the decisions of this *Europa of 27 #all the countries seat  *partícipes of the process of decision that debate #if, with 27, #can adopt  decisions in an hour, in less of two hours or in three hours.
With the commitment of the common position of the month of January of 1998 the Council said that the Union #would back #all the efforts of the *PNUCD in *Afganistán and has taken it, with his finances The problem is the result of these finances.
I ask: it estimates *usted that the Commission has juridical foundations to sustain in his reports, among other things, that are conditions for the association the dismantlement of the #slovakian nuclear head office with the difficult name that begins by "*B" , *Bohunice, and the dismantlement of the nuclear head office in *Bulgaria?
. (*FI) Gentleman President, the register of documents of the Council directed to the public, that was created through the decision of the Council adopted on 19 March 1998, was included in the pages of Internet of the Council on 1 January 1999.
Our position, like deputies of the European Parliament, remains, therefore, protected, and the deputies that fear sincerely that we are elaborating a species of "Letter of the *fisgones" or *algún another right again coin given to the civil servants so that they #can inform confidentially about any unfounded act of the deputies #can be calm, because it do not treats  of *eso at all.
Report (To5-0062/1999) of the Mr. *Schwaiger, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the Communication of the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament: The approach of the EU on the Round of the #Millenium of the *OMC (*COM(1999) 331 - *C5-0155/19 - 1999/2149(*COS))
Are fully in accordance with the control of the institution by part of the *OLAF, but no *nos identify at all with the "politics of complaints" proposed in the frame of the Institutional Agreement among the Commission, the Council and the Parliament that, besides, attentive against the free mandate of the deputies.
And the recent statements of the Commission are not directed to *aplacar said worry: "it Is necessary, declares #this, detain the war of the banana because it intoxicates the transatlantic relation and because the Union #would send a message *desfavorable to the world, to the beginning of the new commercial negotiations".
Gentleman President, in the first editorial of the Report *Dimitrakopoulos-*Leinen, on the future Conference *Intergubernamental, read  the following considering: "Considering the index of abstention in the last #european elections, that shows an increasing loss of interest of the citizens with regard to the current operation of the Union...".
Besides, *me *opongo to the creation of a common military defence, especially in the points 26 and 27, that requires a "compulsory calendar" for the realisation of a politics of security and common defence that guarantee the external borders of the Union.
With the modifications introduced to the proposal of the Commission and that contain  in the report, that involve that the minors of age #can not be registered and the strengthening of the right to the personal integrity, give our support to the report.
Our States members endowed of nuclear head offices work in this question from two years ago like minimum, and the informations that act in our power *nos indicate that the measures *correctivas today are practically finished, to the equal that #all the relative works to the planning of urgency.
And, #if well it is positive the approval of the budgetary line for the next years, is essential that  the dowry of the necessary assignments for the economic and financial support to the reconstruction and the transition of *Timor Oriental to the independence.
It is not of *extrañar that in a situation of despair absolute in the that *cientos of thousands of persons were displaced systematically by the political violence -and here is the enormous difference with the current acts of punctual revenge, although no therefore less condemnable-, *Rugova have lost the control of the strengths.
Gentleman President, as it has remembered the lady speaker, the European Commission sustains that, regarding the plan of action and of fight against the drug of the period 1995-1999, neither the normative instruments neither the programs have been object of a sufficient assessment.
In the sector of the treatment, #would have to give  support to programs of quality, directed to the community in general, to the school means, included the oriented to the imprisoned population, accompanied of initiatives allocated to promote the reduction of risks, an example of the *cuales is the program of exchange of syringes.
Also in this point there was in the past #some criticisms to the bank, went to his investments in the sector of the health in my country of origin, that especially ensured structures aged, or went in the sectors of the traffic and the environment in *Europa oriental.
It That *sucede is that *ello #would involve a modification of the at present applicable norms, which, to his time, #would give place to a delay in the process of taking of decisions on the humanitarian help, #one of #whose main characteristic is the urgency, to be able to *paliar quickly the existent problems in *Turquía.
I go to read in Italian the text for his *Señorías: "it Considers that the work of rehabilitation of the *toxicómanos is, to the equal that #others, a *pilar fundamental for the fight against the drug, in what it takes part in the front of the demand. To said end, backs and encourages the important social work developed by the centres of detoxication, #whose capacity of intervention is precise to intensify" .
We have had knowledge or, more exactly, have had the confirmation that the European Commission had in his power the first part of the report of follow-up of the world-wide market elaborated in application of the Regulation of the Council that *usted has remembered.
The type of conditions that have to bear to resist in the great ships is not acceptable, by it that #if they go  to build new ships, owe *asegurarnos that they fulfil  the best possible criteria and take  measured to ensure that, *cuando transport  to the animals in sea in great ships, take  #all the measures to optimise his conditions.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity and Ask to the Commissioners how thinks the Commission ensure a development of the maritime traffic that increase the security and the respect to the environment, #if it do not allows the follow-up in the development of his activities.
Lady Speaker, come from of *Donegal, a border county of the historical province of the *Ulster, and to the equal that my #irish colleague the Mrs. *Doyle seat a very special gratitude by the advances achieved in *Irlanda of the North lately and, in particular, by the events of these last days.
On 29 July of the present year, the Defender of the European Village directed a writing to this Parliament in relation with a query by his own initiative in the that requested a code of fine administrative behaviour and asked an answer before 30 November.
Second, we have to *explicarles to our political strengths, to our national parliaments and to our societies why take the Conference *Intergubernamental, why want a Letter of rights fundamental, why want the enlargement and why have the responsibility to take that the Community work like #such.
And #this because the strength of the European Union is increasingly the of a bureaucratic power, of a penetrating bureaucracy that wants to occupy of #everything, with the ideological illusion that the Right and the parliamentary procedure are an obstacle that *ralentiza pointlessly the reforms.
We want that in *Helsinki adopt  the necessary decisions to begin to undertake concrete initiatives in the no military and military looks of the common politics of defence, and that indicate  the necessary operative capacities and the institutions that will have to adopt the decisions.
Regarding the participation of the European Parliament, am not in conditions of *aventurar #which will be the solution of the summit of *Helsinki, but already said a time before and go back to repeat that *nosotros have a positive experience of the participation of the Parliament in the last occasion.
Gentleman President, the annual report in question is an important and valid novelty, and his value sees  highlighted by the fact that in the recently concluded Forum on Human Rights, organised by initiative of the #finnish Presidency, the organisations *nogubernamentales, the *ONG, have taken part in the debate in equality of conditions.
Gentleman President, there #be not doubt that with the presentation of this report, the awareness of the public opinion regarding the importance of the subject of the civil rights and of the human rights shows that it gives a new step forward.
In the resolution of the Parliament of 6 October decide to accelerate the relative procedure to the technical and financial assistance necessary for the realisation of the Union *Aduanera; and we took a call to the Council so that it backed the necessary measures.
It imposes , therefore, that the #european strategy with regard to *Turquía take to understand with clarity to the #turkish political class, and to the #turkish society, that there will be a special statute for this country, that will have to fulfil #all the criteria of *Copenhague and of *Luxemburgo so that it advance his #european perspective.
In *tercer place, the voluntary commitment of the car industry -so much the European, as also the Korean and the Japanese- refers  to technical measures of reduction of the broadcasts of CO2, by means of the improvement of the engines, light bodyworks, etc. #This also has to  control.
The Commission foresees in the first part of the letter *b) of the section 2 of the article 5 that the procedures that guarantee the evaluation of the environmental risk and other notable elements #would have to be equivalent to the established in the Directive of the Council 90/220.
And it suits to observe that this supplementary quantity do not compensates at least the whole of the potential production in normal climatic conditions: so only it serves to attenuate the losses quoted in the moment of the cast of the contingents by the States members.
It is much better that the Central Bank European and the European Commission, in collaboration with the commercial banks, occupy  that it exist suitable information and detailed to the public on the design and the characteristics of security of the coins and notes in euros, to begin on 1 November of the 2001, to more take.
Therefore, I ask that these elements -the acceptance and the confidence, the *aproblematicidad and the previous distribution are regulated of #such way that in this stage reinforce  the confidence of the citizens and #this includes the *front-*loading and a sufficient information in the campaign of the euro.
#If it loans  attention to the common goals of the *considerandos of the proposal, fits *apoyarlos full and entirely the responsible exploitation of the banks, the improvement of the competitiveness of the sector, the liberalisation of the market, etc. #All these affirmations have my total compliance.
The use of methods of *crierios wide for the adaptation of the offer and the demand by part of the organisations of producers #would have to be a fundamental support for the competitiveness and the general efficiency of the sector *pesquero in group.
I want *congratularme here of *ella, because it is evident that the European Parliament has to give a very clear signal of defence of the values in that it believes, in particular in a country that is not a country #any one, is a country that has in course a process of adhesion to the European Union.
We go to approve the budget of the year that comes with important quantities allocated to the plan of reconstruction of *Nicaragua after the damages caused by the hurricane *Mitch, and believe that our function is to support and sustain the democratic institutions, that watch by the healthy fulfillment of the rules of the game.
By the contrary, wanted to support to the that have said that no only headed a coherent delegation, but that the disposals of order practical for *nosotros -the greater parliamentary delegation that never has assisted to international conversations on the trade- was in mutual benefit.
It is very significant that have detected  the greater percentage of material errors in the department of management internal because inside this department the same Commission has the exclusive responsibility of the financial management.
It wanted to underline it that has said the Mrs. go *der *Laan in relation with the fraud in the Union, and signal that, to judge by the #news of the press on the fraud in general and the attacks to the public budgets, fits to think that the community budget is more vulnerable that any #another.
It wanted to hail of special form that the Council have approved that in the granting of helps of trip at last #can have in consideration the possibility that only they award  to #that that really the need, so that #that that by financial reasons #can not take part yes #can take it because of this form the money #would put  to his disposal.
Second, although I do not have intention to recommend that we vote against of the report of the Mr. *Busk, believe that it costs the pity call to the caution with regard to the appeal of the speaker of a greater financial participation community in the tasks of inspection and control of the *caladeros.
This participation involves more budgetary resources and, as my colleagues of the Commission of Budgets do not leave to repeat, the size of the cake is limited, by it that every time that cut a new chip, means that it will remain less bear *algún another equally important sector.
On the other hand, the section 2 of the article 7 of our Regulation establishes that the mandate of a deputy only will be able to purchase validity after #this have formulated the statements by writing to that is forced in virtue of the article 6 of the Record of 20 September and of the Annex *I of the Regulation.
The Commission neither #can accept the amendment 19 that forbids the sales of squads that contain *hidroclorofluorocarburo in a term of five years from the prohibition of his use, since it #would increase the probability of practices illegal of poured and broadcasts to the atmosphere of *hidroclorofluorocarburos.
The Summit of *Estambul offered likewise the occasion for the signature of the version modified of the Treaty on the strengths armed and conventional in *Europa, for the adoption of the document of *Viena of 1999 and for the signature of the Letter of Security European.
It #would not be good for the European Union that talked  of a #european common defence but afterwards did not endow  to the Union of the means to assume said defence and at the end finished  causing, by *añadidura, a distance of our #american partners inside the NATO.
The States members have engaged  to renounce to the control of control on 50.000 soldiers in favour of the *euroejército and have yielded the equivalent thickness to a body of army to the common service of the EU.
Gentleman President, has announced , aptly, the Summit of leaders of the EU celebrated in *Helsinki like the of the enlargement of the European Union and did not fits doubt that this meeting of the European Council has been to the height of the hopes in *ella put.
Gentleman President, the President in exercise of the Council and Prime minister, Mr. *Lipponen, and the President of the Commission, Roman Mr. *Prodi, have taken a good summary on the central decisions adopted under the #finnish Presidency and on the pending tasks in the future.
Also it forces to the European Parliament to expand his own field to the sphere of the defence, in particular *cuando  *clausure the Assembly of the Western European Union, so that it #can have an appropriate democratic examination of this delicate and controversial sphere.
The fault of recognition by part of *Turquía of the rights of the *kurdos is the most important cause of his rapes of the #european democratic norms and in matter of human rights and the pretext so that his State was dominated by the soldiers.
*Yo Ask to the Council and to the Commission that adopt immediate measures to guarantee the effective reconversion of the help in the frame of *TACIS, as we #can not continue subsidising a combination of campaign electoral bloody and colonial war *sanguinaria.
*Me Cheer that the Mrs. *Schreyer have referred  before to the supplementary bottoms for the Veterinary Office, that are particularly important, #if we want that it tackle the problems that have arisen owing to the crisis of the *EEB, the crisis of the dioxin in *Bélgica and, of course, the continuous work in *Portugal.
The Commission has adopted, besides, three decisions of application of the Regulation *nº 4064/89, relative to the control of the operations of concentration among companies, and of the Regulation 17/62, of compliance with the articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, by the that they impose  fines that go of 100.000 to 3.000 euros to each #one of the companies that communicated wrong informations in answers to requests of information that  *les had formulated.
In reality, these programs have like fundamental goal the to support the training of professionals of the #european audiovisual industry and promote the artistic creation and the investigation of the Europeans in the audiovisual sphere.
Gentleman President, since  *nos gives the opportunity to debate freely: I have read today in the morning in the *Libération the statement of the Mr. *Ecevit, the one who affirms that after the admission of *Turquía like country candidate to the adhesion to the European Union, has declared: "Inevitably, the borders of *Europa will advance more to Orient... It goes to include #Asia central and finally #all the #asian continent.
Subject: Renewal of the public agreements of services to the companies commissioned of the management of the motorways in #Italia The #italian Government has intention to renew the public agreements to the 20 companies that in these moments manage the #italian motorways.
#If the services of the competent Commission in matter of transport and of the competition work joined, #can advance  an important step to a politics of transfer of the transport of commodities heavy of the road to the railway.
In other words, there #be #a lot of interest in this subject, but still, by it that *yo know, has not got  to a point in the that it #can adopt a decision, but his *Señoría knows that it is not #one of my competitions, talk, therefore, with *mesura and caution, although I #can *decirle that the European Commission is not elaborating still #such directive.
Second, I have said specifically, no only now in this Assembly, but along #a lot of years and also has shown it by means of the measures adopted in my twelve weeks of competent Commissioner to the *respecto, that are not at all satisfied with the number of women in upper places or, in fact, in the categories "To" in general in the Commission.
At present the Commission is centring  in the help for the persons displaced inside the country, among seven and eight millions of euros, by half term, to the year, and in the financial supports to diverse initiatives directed to promote the human rights in the country.
Consistently, the Commission will value, in the first place, the effective incidence of the agreements in matter of competition; #if the incidence was remarkable, the Commission will be able to take into account the economic benefits derived of said agreements of prohibition of competition in his evaluation on the possible applicability of the agreements of *exoneración individual in virtue of the section 3 of the article 81.
Subject: Distribution of vehicles of tourism and political of competition Is conscious the Commission that the car market of the Realm Joined has the most expensive prices for 62 of the 75 models of vehicles of tourism more sold and that the citizens of the Realm Joined have to face up to numerous problems to the hour to buy vehicles in other States members?
*Yo *les Pray that they do not anticipate now a quantity, but that  *atengan to the fact that the Commission goes to present an exact and concrete estimate for this period and for said region, that will be able to and will have to be examined afterwards by the Commission of Budgets, the budgetary authority and the Parliament.
The merits of an organ, of an institution, depend *empero of the persons that have the responsibility of #the same. By #this is particularly important the nomination like members of the Court of Accounts of professional persons and technically competent, but also with a strong and independent personality.
While it procured to interest to #all, from the local authorities of the transport in *Kishinev until the minister of energy in *Uzbekistán, had the following experience: as in *tantos other fields of the politics of the EU, in the projects *TACIS perhaps are treating to take too much, further of *demasiadas geographic borders, in *demasiados sectors.
I consider that the European Parliament has to debate and approve the new instrument that substitutes the program *TACIS, although at present *Rusia, the greatest of the New States, is object of a just initiative of the European Parliament that suspends the agreement of cooperation technological as a result of the war against *Chechenia.
To *nosotros *nos corresponds to create the conditions of peace, cooperation, support, help and association and to the New Independent States, to *Mongolia and first of all to *Rusia, the responsibility to deserve our offer respecting the objective conditions of defence of the fundamental principles of the citizens and of the communities governed.
The Ministers of Environment that took part in the Conference *COP 5 had solid opinions on this subject. But a task that presents  especially difficult is the intervention of the Community in the tendency of his own broadcasts of gases of effect *invernadero, as this tendency is to the heaves in these moments, *cuando, by the contrary, #would have to be downward.
The #irish Government has published a Green Book on the sustainable energy, that will obtain a special category in the frame of the plan of development national for the period 2000-2006.
In particular, the communication takes upsetting in the central importance that attribute to the faithful fulfillment of the conjoint statement, in the that ensures  that, to the equal that in the case of *Hong *Kong, the Commission will follow of wall this subject and -once again to the equal that in the case of *Hong *Kong- will publish an annual report on *Macao.
*Segunda Coincidence: it celebrates  the meeting *interparlamentaria with the Popular Republic of Chinese, it that *nos offers the opportunity to transmit directly to our pairs of the #chinese delegation the depth of our feelings and the liveliness of our hopes regarding *Macao and to the future.

It is necessary to extract the educations owed of the absence of results of the Ministerial Summit of *Seattle, allocated to fix the program for the "Round of the #Millenium", in the level of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
This decision bases  in the scientific conclusions of the #french committee of sanitary security of the foods, that, without leaving to recognise that they had made  progresses, considers that they still exist serious potential risks, as it shows it the persistence of the illness.
The hierarchical system that exists in the judicial processes no *nos allows to imagine neither by a moment that a court of appeal of #any one of the States members request to the Court of Justice of *Luxemburgo that pronounce  in virtue of the article 177 and afterwards, *cuando have pronounced  and no *le enjoy his opinion say "no the will apply" .
Subject: economic Refugees in the EU These last years, the countries of the EU are receiving thousands of pertinent economic refugees of the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental. Said persons add  to the thousands of refugees pertinent of *Turquía and other countries of Orient Half and #Asia that, during years, find shelter in the EU.
On the other hand, the aspiring States take part actively in the work of the *CIREFI. The *CIREFI is a group of work of the Council, in the that the States members exchange the most recent data on the illegal immigration and on the routes used by #the same, well of routine form, well *ad *hoc.
It fits to put in doubt the opportunity to concede a credit to a company that has of an active important and that is situated in a flourishing region from the point of sight economic and possessor of special value and big importance from the point of sight ecological.
*Yo Do not know #if the Mr. *Dupuis is a member of parliament or a false member of parliament, but it that yes want to say is that *yo have finished *haciéndole a very clear question, asking #if had the Council #any concrete initiative for the diffusion of the humanitarian international Right.
The cooperation and the capacity of performance conjoint in this field, that also goes in inside the competitions of the EU, have to be increased clearly by means of this type of operations and also to *través of the general process of the enlargement.
In virtue of these reasons, is to say, owing to the problems related with the terms and the importance of these four reports on the politics of competition, request that they subject  to debate during the first week of sessions of the next year, in January -preferably the Tuesday-, in *Estrasburgo. In name of #all the speakers ask that this appeal proceed.
No only I think in the no disintegrated waste of *BST that store  in the organism, but also in the possible modification of the composition of the milk, by not talking of the increase of the dose of antibiotics that administers  to the ailing cows.

Yes, the bureaucracy considers to the greater citizens that ask the pensions some numbers -*les remember that I am the representative of the Party of the Pensioners and have seen it many times- by #this #would wish that in the files put  the photos of these citizens and that our citizens went labelings and considered at least like the *bueyes.
#One of two: or it knows  the origin of the bovine animals and #can raise  the embargo on the #british meat, or #can not  label to these bovine animals, by not to know the origin of the meat, but then, in #such case, #can raise  the embargo?
The Council also knows that they do not fulfil  the criteria for his entry and that neither there are expectations that they go  to fulfil, had account that *Turquía not even is had to modify fundamental disposals of his Constitution, as for example the relative to the influence of the Army.
And, in the external plane, regret in particular the fault of quotation #any to the *gravísima situation *angolana and of reservations to the agreement *concertado with *México, that #can favour as a whole to the countries of the *TLC, aggravate the inequality in the reciprocal access to the markets and prejudice gravely the interests of industries #european.
Also it #can be the point of game so that the fixed price of the book call it, with arrangement to the #french law, "European"  suppose a clear signal of the national States that they assume the responsibility to this *respecto and that do not answer with the usual *muletilla: "*eso decides  in *Bruselas" .
To impulses of the #french Governments and German, the Council supported  in the position of the European Parliament to approve, on 8 February 1999, a resolution by the that asked  specifically the continuity of the existent systems of price of the book.
I #can *asegurarles that without fixed price of the book #would not have been able to *subsistir.

Because, as it says it #one of these brave women that resist and heave his voice to say to the world *algo abominable, the quote: "the discriminations against the women have converted  in a platitudinous problem in the current world, but it that the women are living in *Afganistán is only and without precedents".

A time the #french authorities have finished to evaluate the damages, the Commission, in the frame of the new planning of programs for the years 2000 to 2006 will be able to loan specific helps for the protection against natural risks by means of the *cofinanciación of investments.
In 1997 it presented  a modification of this same Decision that *prorrogaba by two years more the term so that the States members sent his reports and the term with that explains the Commission to elaborate the report of progress for the Parliament and for the Council.
Therefore, I request a commitment express of the Commission that it will define every year, among the plans *prioritarios of technical action that *le are proposed by the Permanent Committee of Agricultural Statistics, it requested in our amendments 4 and 5, since in contrary case *nos #would take to lengthen the process of *codecisión and *ello #would hamper the preparation of his statistical reports by part of the States members.
From the point of sight political, the most important message is the content in the amendments 4 and 5, in the that advises  the tabulation crossed of the helps offered, among other things, in function of the extension of the statistics.
This information is especially significant when considering the social look of the agriculture, being important to support even a system of investigation that piped the greater part of the help to the latifundiums of the agricultural regions more favoured.
In consequence, and logically, the Commission of Budgets *nos has signalled, to *nosotros, the Commission of Industry competent regarding the bottom, that in any case #can endorse donations that are not today *presupuestadas, and that are not in the financial perspectives, mainly the category 4, of the that know *ustedes that is already under pressure to try fund *Kosovo.

Subject: *Interreg for the islandsThinks to back the Council the demands of inclusion of a specific line of cooperation *interinsular in the program *Interreg, #such as it requested  in diverse amendments of the Parliament in the first reading of the Report *Varela *Suanzes-*Carpegna on the European Bottom of Regional Development?
Gentleman President, the Council did not knows up to now any case of accumulation. The Commission neither has presented to the Council any proposal that have like goal a modification of the prohibition of accumulation determined in the statute.
We have finished the turn of questions, have sacked to the Mr. *Verheugen and, now, as *usted has asked the word for a question of order, *usted has to direct to the presidency because it is the presidency the one who has to answer to the questions of order.
By it other, gentleman speaker, his conclusions coincide, by fortune -as it has remembered *usted-, with the intentions expressed yesterday by the Mr. *Prodi by it that refers  to the Commission, *cuando talked of the strengthening of the paper of the President, of the efficiency, of the transparency and of an individual and collective responsibility.
I expect that also the General Secretariat of the Commission and the managers of the administrations follow the recommendations. But I am not very safe that like this it was, because his decision of not rehabilitating to the Mr. Go *Buitenen in his previous charge takes to fear it worse.
#If on the one hand the vertiginous economic growth offers possibilities to improve the situation of the environment, by the #another, also accelerates increasingly the pollution of the ecological surroundings. To avert this pollution will have to introduce  simultaneously an environmental legislation more rigorous.
In any case, at present #can say that they have gone in in vigour each #one of the ten agreements for *Europa, and that the help for the *preadhesión on the that the European Council of *Berlín has reached an agreement, will include a duplication of the financial support to the countries of the *Europa central and of the east.
In *Polonia, with the entrance in vigour of the new Penal Code and of the Law of *Enjuiciamiento Criminal, #as well as with the instauration of a Commissioner for the protection of the civil rights, have obtained  important results in the terrain of the political criteria.
Regarding the adoption of the *acervo have reached  some acceptable advances, especially inside the context of the union *aduanera. But they need  still considerable back efforts in the terrain of the inner market; and here again I am talking, especially, of the fiscal and financial field.
#I.la Proposed of regulation (*CE) of the Council by the that it modifies  the Regulation 19/65/*CEE, relative to the application of the section 3 of the article 85 of the Treaty to determined categories of agreements and practical *concertadas (*COM(98)0546 - *C4-0628/98-98/0287 (*CNS)); #Ii.la proposed of regulation (*CE) of the Council by the that it modifies  the Regulation 17, *primer regulation of application of the articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (*COM(98)0546 - *C4-0628/98-98/0288 (*CNS)).Has in the first place the word, like speaker, the Mrs. *Thyssen.
Also it is essential that the Statute of the Defender of the European Village contain a clear disposal in the sense that the Defender has right to inspect #all the archives and necessary documents, to avert unnecessary controversies and prolonged with the institutions.
But this protection of the rights of the community citizens #would not be sufficient #if we did not promote a narrow collaboration and cooperation among this Parliament, and in concrete the Commission of Requests, competent in this matter, and the Defender the Village.
The brochure of information public of the European Parliament about the right of request declares that the requests reveal often in a Been practical member that they are contrary to the letter or to the spirit of the community legislation.
Like result of the requests, the European Parliament has had positive effects in the daily life of the citizens and has been able to act to find a solution of the cases that include questions of the competition of the Community.
It is important that this commission #can continue his work, but expect that the Commission was had to offer #the same commitments about an agile processing of the requests, to the equal that has taken  with the article 169 of the Treaty *CE, around the claims.
In this sense, wanted to express my gratitude to the Parliament by the support that in #all moment has loaned to the Commission in the launching of this big operation of information that is «Citizen of *Europa» (*Citizens *First) that has allowed, for the first time, to the citizens be very informed on his rights.
We are in presence of a horizontal politics in front of a sectorial politics; more still, among the recently attributed competitions to this commission appear: «The relations with the local and regional powers and with the Committee of the Regions».
It accepts likewise the amendment 23, to exception of the point 2: technically #the same #can not suppress because, in the case of exceptions with regard to the application of the first and *segunda managerial banking, #would not state the corresponding definitions to the competent authorities neither to the own bottoms.
The Commission of Subjects Economic underlines in his report the importance that *reviste for the young companies and the innovative companies of the sector of the high technologies a #european market of capital of risk *circulante and efficient.
Therefore, it is indispensable to initiate the reflection on a new type of international cooperation, and for *ello, it is necessary to consider, for example, the definition of a norm of the European Union that serve of base to the new regulation and to the new prudential control in the breast of the Union.
Gentleman President, the political task is clear: the Commission has to present to the Council *ECOFIN a plan of action on the financial services, and the aforementioned Council has to subject this plan to the approval of the European Council of Colony.
The fight against the violence is particularly complex. It supposes the collaboration of the police and the justice, #as well as a possible modification of the legislation, and the information and sensitisation, no only of the public opinion, but also of the official services involved.
The Commission already had decided that it made  a study on the security of the tunnels inside the *quinto programs frame of investigation and development. Specifically, in relation with the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, the Commission has foreseen to fund the improvements of the tunnel in the frame of the networks *transeuropeas.
And from here we send a message of solidarity to *Xanana *Gusmãor, the man that in 1992 was condemned to twenty years of prison and is at present in domiciliary prison, but loomed to go back to the prison, to the total prison, only because it took a call in *pro of the self-defence of the village *timorense.
It prefers  rather bomb, despising the principle of sovereignty and running the danger to unchain a third world-wide war, to the #serbian village, that, in his province, *Kosovo, cradle of his nation, tries to put to except his national and religious identity.
The Commission is satisfied with the new politics of the #indonesian Government that includes the recognition, by part of #this, of the need to celebrate direct elections in *Timor to end to determine in how measured are acceptable the criteria for the autonomy that now are  negotiating in New *York.
I think that on it that it is necessary to interrogate -taking into account that by a time the Union, together with the Commission and the Commissioner *Marín in particular, together with the Council (and #this is rather exceptional) and, obviously, together with our Parliament, has had a very clear position in relation with *Birmania- is #if, as it asked the Mr. *Vecchi, *Birmania is really isolated.
Gentleman President, this Parliament, to the equal that the other democratic institutions, has to launch a signal and a warning to leave clear that the rape of the human rights is an intolerable offence that did not forgets  with the time.
These amendments have a political value in the sense that they express our priorities. We #can not accept, for example, that the small breweries of my country see  forced to abandon his activity simply because they no longer #can sign the agreements of supply of beer as the know now.
The report takes a call to the government so that it keep a dialogue regulate with the opposition and the social speakers to end to create a favourable political environment for the integration of *Hungría in the EU.
The amendments of the Mrs. *Bennasar, that have received the support of the Commission of Rights of the Woman, enhance more the participation of the no governmental organisations in the execution of the program *DAPHNE.
But, especially, I create *yo, the right to the life, the right to the dignity, the right to the freedom and integrity of each #one. It supposes a clear reference to the human rights by it that this program, perhaps, #can be *algo wider and his content *originario, the that there was before, #can recover.
The main goal of the program *quinquenal *DAPHNE proposed is to support and boost to the no governmental organisations and to the voluntary organisations so that *mancomunen his efforts and protect to the boys, to the youngsters and to the women against #all type of violence.
The discrimination follows being very high in #all the fields, and believe that #all these persons do not want to be treated like objects of the public assistance, but that demand with reason to the society and to the political his right to a life without discriminations in some safe social surroundings.
Finally, *me seems regrettable, instead, the silence of the report regarding the demographic looks -although *les speakers talk of *ello in a *primer moment, from the beginning of his report- because anyway at all will be possible -although it was not more that in the financial plane- #if it do not corrects  the demographic pyramid of *Europa, that is *reveladora of a true tragedy.
But also it treats , since *nos find in a world-wide market, to impose in the next negotiations of the *OCM that will take place in *Seattle on 30 November, that treats  really to disassemble the rigidities of the market and that the European Union #can act here exactly with #the same equality of rights that in other great sectors.
In the first place, it treats  of the competitiveness of the #european industry of the starch; it treats  of the agreements of *Berlín on seeds *oleaginosas and on plants *albuminosas that, as #all know, are entirely insufficient and do not suffice to diminish the deficit that there #be in these markets, no *pudiéndonos, therefore, serve of any big help in the current form.
I have listened with satisfaction that the gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, in some mood, recognises to the Been member the possibility to say the last word regarding this politics, but fear the sanction that the General Direction *IV, responsible of the competition, reservation usually to the state helps.
In effect, *usted has taken the decision to declare inadmissible a motion of censorship presented by 66 pertaining deputies to #all the political groups. Of this form *usted has questioned an inherent right to #all deputy.
Lady Speaker, #if well an absolute hit of the euro #would improve the competitiveness of the European Union, #would wish to call the attention on the fact that the structural unemployment represents to his time a threat for this same competitiveness.
Always *me has upset a lot hear these great statements *vanagloriándose of the reduction of the public helps to the companies, without wanting to accept that, in the meantime, the majority of the companies, of the great companies privatised, no longer invest in basic investigation neither in *I+*D, taking that our technological level retreat.
At present we have thirteen socialist governments. So much his voters like the #european villages expect that they put in practice a politics no only to the service of the employment, but also to the service of a social model that do not base  in the precariousness.
To me, in any case, no *me #would enjoy to finish -since it is a conjoint debate- without saying that, regarding the management of 1996, my delegation -my delegation and *yo same- fix already our position, and that, in these moments in that the Commission has resigned, believe that no thus they #would have to forget  the commitments of the Mr. *Santer, that #would have to be assumed by the new President *Prodi.
In the proposal of resolution that tomorrow will have *ustedes that vote, *Señorías, attaches  a document of work that enumerates the points that need explanation by part of the Commission, so that the resultant Parliament of the elections #can proceed to the approval of the corresponding management to 1997.
In the case of the resources for the *cofinanciación the Commission criticises that the realisation of projects concrete hard too much time and that, especially, the flow of the resources involves with great frequency problems for the no governmental organisations.
Changes, in end, and very important, of politics, of content, of ambition, of inspiration, of underlying political principles in those matters that happen of the *tercer to the *primer *pilar in the field of the justice and of the subjects of interior and the big change that supposes the integration of the social Protocol in the same Treaty.
In this sense, gentleman President, the Parliament do not goes to admit that any institution *le impose his interpretation on questions of procedure, questions that have to be seen -and *eso says it very well the report of the Commission- on the base that the act adopted will be it with arrangement to the Treaty of *Amsterdam and that #that is the procedure that has to respect.
The report of the Mrs. Palace proposes a procedure that confirms the that it already chose the European Parliament after *Maastricht and that supposes the confirmation, by part of the Parliament, of the legislative procedures already initiated and #whose juridical foundation or procedure have seen  modified in virtue of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
And in the case of the two agreements on the transmission of acts and on the recognition of decisions in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility -proposed that the Commission will approve morning on the base of the Treaty- will transmit  immediately to the Council and to the Parliament.
The European Union and the States Joined, *Canadá, New *Zelanda, *Australia, have each #one a vote in the *OMC, but *cientos of countries in roads of development that expect in the *OMC with the hope that also they take  in account his interests do not have to be separated by the continuous *reyertas among the European Union and the States Joined, as it treats  also of other essential problems.
The nominations that take for his office, the character or the tonality multinational or no of his personnel, the balance among the sexes, #all these things will purchase a totally disproportionate importance concerning his real importance.
Regarding his intervention about the need that in the great countries there #be a commissioner of the majority party and a commissioner of the opposition, *le will say that in *Alemania abuses  of this possibility to leave sideways to the Greens, partners of the coalition.
Likewise, in front of the war in *Kosovo and first of all it that this war reveals of the fragilities of *Europa, wish ardently that the European Union cessation to tackle the future of our continent -the *Europa Central and Oriental, *Rusia, the Mediterranean- with a so careful vision that is too much narrow and finishes for being imprudent.
It exists an institutional and political lack that is to the sight of #all, that is the challenge of the next term of office and that it #can be a suggestion to take to the new generations: the invitation to no *escatimar efforts in favour of the adventure of the culmination of the construction of *Europa.
The President of the Central Bank European, Mr. *Duisenberg, do not tires  to repeat: «*Me have assigned the task to keep the value of the euro and to keep the stability of prices.
Regarding the future, only has referred  to a generic and, in this moment, *fumosa international conference on the *Balcanes that evades the imminent and more urgent problems, and has evoked the unhappy image of the «*Europa of the sword», term that the President #Jacques *Delors abhorred.
During his mandate, will have to achieve *usted simultaneously two attainments, to know, the consolidation of the European Union, #whose tasks and dimensions have increased  spectacularly in the last years and the last decades, putting order in those looks in the that it was necessary, so that, although they do not introduce  novelties, the Commission was truly able to work and work.
*Yo Believe that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament still will have to take *algún institutional effort to avert that #everything *ello escape  in the practice of the frame *auténticamente community and that the Ministers of Finances convert  by this path in the new masters of *Europa.
Regarding the vision of a project, *usted has mentioned the need of an external representation and the capacity to take *extensivo to #all *Europa through the enlargement, but also to the *Balcanes, for example, the order of peace that have created in his breast.
Finally, although I have appreciated his proposal for the stability of *Europa of the South and Oriental and an international conference on the *Balcanes, have to say that the interventions armed never have carried the peace, #if *acaso have detained the clashes, but no deleted his causes.
From my point of sight, the excessive *tecnicismo, the excessive *economicismo of the European Council of *Berlín has to be corrected by a community economic politics that take in consideration #all the interests of #all the regions and #all the countries of the European Union.
This affirmation is not some, because the bilateral parities among the #european coins fixed  on 1 May 1998 -takes precisely a year- and the goal of the rigid fixation of the coins among yes prevails from takes varied years.
*Nos Surprises to ascertain, in particular, that the growth is feebler in the countries that find  in the centre of the system euro and that they are taxpayers to the system of the structural Bottoms, and stronger in the most peripheral countries or *beneficiarios of the #european subventions.
Like this they will be able to *escucharme, because, in part, agree with my friend *Hervé *Fabre-*Aubrespy *cuando say that *eso already have seen it before in this Parliament, but that the application with immediate character, to the following minute, of an act that has to still be consecrated by means of the Record is *algo entirely new and that, on the other hand, adjusts  to the spirit in the that approve the Report *Elles.
#If we had approved the amendment of the Socialist Group, *algo that lamentably have taken 212 colleagues, there #would be denial of the approval of the management and said comments #would not have any juridical value, comments that, repeat, condemned to the Commission.
It #would be paradoxical that the Parliament pronounced  before the end of his mandate on said approval of the management, without having of #all the elements, *cuando the second inform of the Committee of Wise persons expects  for the autumn and *cuando still do not give  the conditions for *pronunciarnos with definite character.
The war of *Kosovo *nos shows also another thing and wanted to go back to remember the words of #François *Mitterand, although it also #can quote to *Helmut *Kohl, the one who said that in *Europa are in game the war and the peace, and no only the economy, the ordinations of the market and the prices of intervention, by important that also was all #this.
Without this guarantee of security, the refugees, the deported, will not return and the consequence #would be that *Milosevic #would have reached his purpose and #would live in #one *Europa that no longer #would be #ours *Europa, the that in fact defends this Assembly, in his quality of Parliament of the *Europa of the integration.
Also we regret the involuntary civil victims of the aerial attacks, but *nos feel morally forced to follow supporting the goal to detain the greater evil, is to say, the racist politics of *Milosevic and those who surround it.
With the *resurgir of the nationalism in *Rusia and the social deprivation in increase of the majority of the #russian village, have the duty and the interest that *Europa collaborate with *Rusia to intensify the democracy, the security and the prosperity of #all our citizens.
I believe that for the Parliament and for the members of parliament is very important the stability and fixation of his juridical diet and that, therefore, the Council and the Parliament #would have to follow working by this road without thinking in a clash without any solution of commitment.
Well, lady Speaker, *yo *me take #this very seriously and expect that the *servcios that review #this objectively, get tomorrow to the conclusion that the report -the report that was and with the number that have, *yo on my part *me refer to the report To-0245 that is in the agenda and that has a determined content, do not put  in the agenda. To me *me #would result very doubtful that the report was modified by the services and that afterwards was put in the agenda.
I do not doubt in saying that the campaigns of promotion of the banks and other agencies of credit are contributing in big way to the prices *inflacionarios of the house, putting with *ello the house out of the scope of the youngsters that wish to install his *primer home.
The common position *les gives to the States members the possibility to introduce an obligation of claim in the course of two months, or was that the consumer will have to discover and report the defect in the course of two months.
It #can say that these procedures always go very fast, but in this case have a model in the that #many of the reservations expressed in a principle, #many of the fears with regard to the commercial interests, #many of the fears of the deputies, appeased  thanks to the way in that said procedures carried out.
And *nos concerns that the normal foods that have special characteristics that the take especially ideal for the sportsmen, as they are the paste and #a lot of drinks, happened to remain included inside the specific directive, it that *les #would create big confusion to the consumers and #would bump clearly with this simplification of the norms that the managerial #would have to promote.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0206/99) of the Mr. *Manzella, in name of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, on the relative common statement to the practical modalities for the new procedure of *codecisión (article 251 of the *TCE)
Think in the principle of equality fiscal among #all the deputies, that #can admit transitory exceptions but never definite; in the respect to the rights purchased by the deputies in matter of pensions in years of work inside and out of this Parliament, or in other questions of detail that is not necessary to enumerate now.
It is necessary to begin already to prepare the peace and collaborate with the countries of the region to build a stable system of cooperation among *ellos and boost a development that *les allow to adhere what before to a Union that bases  in the respect to the one who is different and in the integration of his wealths and cultural and human diversities.
Of course, the lean point of the European Union follow being the external politics and of common security. The #german Presidency has insisted in the need to develop the article 17 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Regarding the institutional calendar, are totally of agreement in that it is already an imperative that take  the institutional reform, that fix  the stages that carry to a Conference *Intergubernamental, and #can *decirle to the Council that the Parliament has worked during #a lot of years in establishing a true catalogue of fundamental rights.
Obviously, the European Parliament goes to boost this governmental evolution and, to begin, will take it by means of the resolution that definitely goes to vote in some instants and that pretends to give to the Commission a paper engine in the institutional reform.
Without embargo, before adopting any decision #would be more careful to expect the second inform of experts of the that the European Parliament, with #all prudence, has postponed his publication until after the #european elections and that certainly *clarificará of interesting form the operation of the institutions.
It is clear that in spite of #all the respect by the Presidents and Majesties that there was to the beginning of the unification of *Europa and of the common contractual drama, today day are the fundamental rights the that they have to constitute the central point. Fundamental rights in the that it declare  that the citizens and citizens want to build *Europa in freedom, peace and solidarity.
The gradual approach of the prices of support, accompanied by direct payments, to the level of prices in the world-wide market prepares to our companies for the back liberalisation of the world-wide trade that already is  outlining.
With regard to the structural politics: the clear *disciplinamiento of the structural politics by means of the internal concentration, is to say, with less objective of help and less community initiatives and by means of a concentration of the stage of the helps, contributes an increase of the efficiency.
Central look of #all the structural Bottoms will be thus the creation of places of work with future, it that means growth with intensive generation of employment, strengthening of the competitive and innovative capacity of the regions, sustainable development and promotion of the qualification and of the equality of opportunities.
Gentleman President, the representatives of the Council approved yesterday the prohibition in #all the European Union of *amianto white, in spite of which exists #one some restlessness that they produce  unnecessary delays in the signature of this document, in the that the Parliament has exerted a positive paper to promote it.
The question of the hormones in the meat shows that they do not take  in account the requirements of health and protection of the consumers and the scarce importance of the «principle of caution» in front of the dominant economic interests.
The three conflicts that have at present among the European Union and States Joined regarding the World-wide Organisation of the Trade are relative to the sector of the banana, of the meat with hormones and of the noise of the planes in the takeoff and in the landing.
The social consequences in #some of these countries are very important: the States members of the European Union lose progressively, after the *OMC, his circle of influence regarding the #african continent especially, and *ello in benefit of the continent *sudamericano #whose agricultural resources are exploded or *valorizados in big part by companies dominated by #american capitals.
It is precise that #that that negotiate in name of the *OMC take out shine to his arms and *nos reassure: the alignment of the community regulations with the rules of the game of the world-wide market never will be able to constitute an agricultural political goal for the European Union.
In effect, how #can be  satisfied with a commitment that involves an important descent of the income of the #european agriculturalists, consecutive to a descent of the partially compensated prices, expecting his total suppression to satisfy the requirements of the *OMC?
Perhaps in this context of austerity budgetary earn #all his dimension the imperative established in the relative Treaty to that #all the community politics -and no only the structural- have to orient from the perspective of the economic and social cohesion.
Also we think that it is important -and #this is in line with my report- that the conclusions of *Berlín indicate clearly that in *Europa will have to loan a greater attention to the quality of the feeding, the security, the protection of the environment, the respectful deal with the animals, etc., to #european level.
Thus, with the end to avert this threat, vote in the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development an amendment that excludes any possibility to expand the viticultural zone to any #another Been clear-cut member or required in this amendment.
Our will *nos carried in December to withdraw the called «strategic amendments» to the budget for the year 1999, and #few days before the European Council of *Berlín, the president *Samland sent a letter to the fifteen ministers of Inland revenue *informándoles of the figures that the European Parliament considered absolute minima, the called «*minima *minimorum» .
Before I have explained the basic principles of the reform of the structural Bottoms, by it that no *les go to bore now with concrete opinions on the different amendments as I have understood in #all his interventions that go to follow the procedure #such as it has agreed .
We regret that in the European Council of *Berlín have agreed  a significant reduction of the money that goes  to allocate so much to the structural Bottoms as to the Bottom of Cohesion, but understand also that his application will be positive in the next seven years.
And I believe that we have to take into account that these structural Bottoms are practically the last that apply  to the fifteen States members, since the perspective of the enlargement to the States of the centre and of the east of *Europa will modify the politics of action regional for the next years.
Gentleman deputy, in the last times has indicated  with clarity to *Turquía that his behaviour in the case *Ocalan, the guarantee of a process according to the norms of a State of right, goes to have repercussions on the relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Of how mood thinks to take part the Council so that it guarantee  the effective protection of the human rights in the *Iraq, in sight, besides, of the debates in the breast of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined on the lifting of the economic sanctions?
And as we believe that we are in favour of the protection of the human rights -and are it, and take well in being it-, #would want *preguntarle #if the innocent population, #if the innocent citizens of *Iraq are not included in the category of the population on the that is in vigour the defence of the human rights.
Thus, it #can the Council confirm or deny these data? They go to take  measured to ensure that the #swedish tongue receive #the same treatment that the great community tongues, and that, from now on, the #swedish representatives #can use his tongue and have an interpreter?
Go back to the article 203 of the Treaty, as they defend #many of this Parliament, in my opinion is not the correct path, will carry to a greater increase of the costs of the Union. Especially the States members that are #net taxpayers hardly will be able to accept it.
Gentleman President, before dissolving , this Parliament has achieved to pronounce on the set up of the reform of the structural Bottoms and has reached to affirm his positions in the that has run the risk to convert , once again, in a confrontation among the #european Institutions.
In any case, the *PAC follows being -of course- #one *PAC thrown off balance, in the measure in that, for being based in the concept of productivity historical, the richest countries result clearly much more favoured that the poorest, #if well no  *me happens by the head take of the poor rich and of the rich poor.
Without damage of the cheques distributed by the diverse countries, the regulation of the structural Bottoms, in particular by means of intermediate evaluations of the reservation of efficiency and of levels generally inferior of *cofinanciación, goes to take that, in the practice, the financial endowments happen to be of «limit of costs», whereas they were «objective of costs».
In this reform of the market of the wine have imposed the requirements of the European Parliament, and #can not more that go back to highlight that it #would be desirable that the Parliament #can *codecidir in the future, because the trade *vacuno dominate it so well like the Council.
#If to #this #can not call «by the *pelos'...!; They are the eleven less chamber of the night and the Parliament is working to full performance, even with the presence of the Council, by which *me *congratulo, gentleman President of the Council, since I never have seen before to the Council here in this Parliament to the eleven less chamber of the night. I appreciate it , it is not other that say it.
Previous detailed examination and after keeping numerous informal contacts to #all the levels, the Parliament #would have to be now in position to issue his opinion about the proposal, so that the Council #can continue his work with a crystalline knowledge of the wishes of the Assembly.
We have wanted to treat it in this last session and the Commission simply has followed his usual guideline; #if #this had not been the last session, #would have included  in the session of the next month.
#If the Council had wanted to exert *algún paper, #would have to have worked in reaching an agreement *interinstitucional that put end to the anomalous situation signalled in the that the European Parliament, in formal terms, sees  involved in insufficient measure in the results of the social dialogue.
Gentleman President, gentleman vice-president of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen deputies, with this debate that initiate on the known and already famous global agreement with *México, closes  a cycle of five years in the that the Parliament has worked and collaborated actively with the European Commission to renew and deepen the relations with the group of the countries of *América Latin and also with *México.
This decision is unlucky because it contributes to accelerate the deterioration, increasingly evident, of the commercial flows, affected, from five years ago, by the dynamism of the *NAFTA, and that, in this period, has reduced our quota in the #mexican market of a 11 % to a modest 6 %.
Now well, said #this, and remaining clear that want an agreement with *México, *nosotros #can not *obviar the quantity of questions posed by the different organisations no governmental, that are not #one neither two, and that are not little important: International Amnesty, *Human *Rights *Watch , the League of Rights Human International, *Intermon.
It treats  rather to look for a #worthy exit for a group of persons that during #a lot of years have put all his obstinacy in the cooperation of *Schengen and that #can not see prejudiced by the integration of *Schengen in the frame of the Union *Europa.
Nevertheless, it #can not deny that the definite texts so only got the Monday to the Parliament, that so only the Monday #can argue the final result of the negotiations and that, besides, the query to the Parliament really is pure theatre, since it already is all decided.
Without embargo, also is truth that the proposal of the Commission and the report of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens contribute numerous solutions. To my mood to see, both have made an excellent work.
The Group of the Popular Party European and big part of the Commission of Subjects Juridical back the proposal of the Commission, but there are #some amendments that do not deserve our support, especially the that refer  to the responsibility of the intermediaries.
In summary, gentleman President, the Popular Party European backs, in a very important measure, the report of the Commission of Subjects Juridical, backs #any amends posed by the Liberal Group and, to exception of the that has mentioned so much the Mr. *Hoppenstedt as *yo same, will vote in favour of *ellas in general terms.
It treats  of a historical moment in the that exists already the possibility to make a follow-up of the to scale world-wide persons, in the that -for the first time- the civil rights #can not  protect with help of the borders, as it has come occurring until the moment.
I remember #a lot of moments in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and, among *ellos, the shared with the Mrs. *Oddy that, in subjects that began in the previous term of office about the new technologies concerning his incompatibility with the rights of author, always have got to similar positions.
In the world of the communications in line, the consumer receives an avalanche of information and the States members #can not protect in the national legislation because the electronic trade *rebasa the borders of the countries.
Especially, it #would wish to express to my colleagues of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens how much have appreciated the work that have made during these five last years, #as well as formulate to the Commission of Subjects Juridical my best *augurios with regard to the next mandate.
*Cuando This morning *me have *enterado by chance that the debate on this report #would not take place until this afternoon to the 18.00 hours and #would proceed  to the vote tomorrow in the morning, have got to the conclusion that it is a deeply unfair decision put that it that is in game is the future of the persons, of the young persons.
#One of the amendments that go to vote, specifically the number 4, that forms part of the commitment that have agreed with the Council, involves a modification of the section first of the article 3 of the Regulation, adding a new initiative, the community initiative *Urban.
#This is not the only reason by the that request that we split of the idea that this vote require a qualified majority. *Me Base equally in the political need that a decision of these characteristic review character highly *vinculante for the Council, the Commission and also for the Parliament.
In general lines are in favour of the reform, without embargo, have to formulate #some reservations in regard to #some looks that still have not deepened  it sufficient as, for example, the impact in the regions that, in name of the principle of concentration, run the risk to suffer a stagnation in his process of development.
#This is the reality, while it seems that they discern  #some hopes of negotiation after the trip to Blunt of #Ibrahim *Rugova and the release of the three #american soldiers, this Parliament, in his last hours of work, chooses with this vote on *Kosovo the path *mortificador of the propaganda of the NATO and *fracasa in his political paper.
The Mrs. *Danze-*Serfaty is the wife of the Mr. #Abraham *Serfaty, the one who remained imprisoned during 17 years in the prison of *Tazmamart in quality of political prisoner, and that it was received with #all the honours in this Assembly, after his release, that produced , especially, thanks to the interventions and resolutions of our Parliament. Without embargo, #can not go in in *Marruecos, *cuando no longer *recae on *él any indictment.
The Commission, as #all *ustedes, applauds the signature during the past morning of the agreement that establishes the frame of the autonomy of the territory, the modalities of query and the organisation of the referendum and, also, the disposals in matter of security.
On the other hand, during these two years, and from the common position of the Council of Ministers, elaborated  a program of help humanitarian and of rehabilitation of urgency that took  on the base of *Cáritas, by the importance that had the Catholic Church in *Timor Oriental and, particularly, the Prize *Nobel Archbishop *Belo.
Regarding the question that presented the Mr. *Bertens and the Mrs. Go *Bladel on purpose of the hospital, the hospital of *Gaza is a hospital of the *UNRAC, is not a hospital of the European Commission or fact by the European Commission, is a hospital of the *UNRAC.
Gentleman President, is very significant that this Parliament, that has concerned  enormously by the question of the human rights, go back once again on the subject of the International Penal Court in the last session of urgency on the human rights of this term of office.
It invites to mayors, managers, engineers and architects to collaborate in a common project that pretends to take advantage of in the new constructions the energy facilitated by the sun instead of building of #such form that need  #a lot of pertinent electricity of the nuclear energy to heat the houses.
Generally, the small companies do not have neither of the means neither of the professional capacity to make a follow-up of the monetary situation that *les allow to follow with a sufficient security the behaviour of the money.
So much before as after this resolution, the juridical conditions that regulate the supervision of the #telephone calls, the interception and the control of the access to Internet belong exclusively to the field of application of the national Right.
Report (To4-0259/99) of the Mr. *Jarzembowski in name of the Commission of Transports and Tourism on the proposal of directive of the #european Parliament and of the relative Council to the application of *gravámenes in the heavy vehicles of transport of commodities by the utilisation of determined infrastructures ((*COM)96/0331 - *C4-0027/97-96/0182(*COD)) - before 96/0182 (*SYN)
The first proposed of the Commission broke seriously the balance among the starch of potato and the grain. These proposals #would have had disastrous consequences for the income of the producers of the starch of potato.
Nevertheless, and in brief, I believe that the Group of the Greens #would have to follow give advance and *ofrecerle his support, but also consider that it #would have to carry out a suitable assessment of this type of events so that we #can take advantage of the experiences of face to the future and to the coming exhibitions.
The Commission expects to continue the cooperation with the European Parliament and his services to ensure that the participation of the Union in the *Expo 2000 was an important event that *acerque more the European Union and his institutions to his citizens.
Of habit, the Fridays receive to my groups of visitors and #can *asegurarle that for the citizens of my country that have had the privilege to visit the European Parliament, *usted is the President of session more popular.
I create deeply in the parliamentary institution and am deeply convinced that the *legitimación democratic of #all the process of integration #european assent  on this Parliament, the full recognition of his paper and his capacity of cooperation with the national Parliaments.
The pirouettes that finishes to execute *usted here, gentleman *Poettering, show nevertheless that the fall of the folds of his suit #can not be and never will get to be so attractive like the of the that adorn the face of our Minister of Subjects External.
I want to congratulate personally of special mood no only to the Federal Chancellor but also to the Minister of Subjects External, the President of the Council that is here present, gentleman *Fischer, by have not saved efforts to go out of this difficult bellicose situation.
Thus, it is necessary to put prompt to disposal the necessary money for *ello and create the corresponding organisation so that we do not devote the greater part of the work to that an organisation coordinate  with the #another but that the essential part of the work devote  to help sure enough to the *Balcanes and that convert  at last in a peaceful region of this *Europa.
Gentleman President, the serious and negative repercussions of the financial crisis, of the *desaceleración of the economic growth in the European Union, -also in the era of the Economic and Monetary Union- have shown clearly of dramatic mood it necessary that it was the #european pact by employment of Colony.
*Les Want to ask on his disposal, his personal disposal to accept that they have to *rendir accounts and answer in front of the citizens of *Europa by #everything it that take together with his president, #as well as in front of this Assembly, with a clear public understanding and absolute that #this is the public forum of the #european democracy in front of the that owe *rendir accounts and answer publicly.
Nevertheless, it wanted to plead by that, when acting like this, do not launch  to the boy with the water of the bath and comprise  well that sometimes #one of the causes of failure of the previous Commission was the loss of the notion of function public.
Without a #european strategy in this sense, runs  the risk that an economy like the #ours bend  to concentrate his resources in the strongest zones leaving to the *margen the feeblest, although #some have made remarkable progresses in the last times.
Gentleman President, gentlemen representatives of the Presidency of the Council, *Señorías, ladies and gentlemen, is not timely that the representative of the Commission in functions expose of extensive mood his opinion here on the program of the #finnish Presidency of the Council as it treats  of a program that will apply  in first line with the new Commission.
Without embargo, believe that the President of his country *nos has contributed the formidable demonstration of the contribution that the Europeans #can contribute to the peace in the continent and to the preparation of a #european solution to the #european problems.
Finally, concerning the pity of death, *me will allow that it signal to his attention and *le insist so that the Presidency take part with #all his weight in *Estambul and also in *Teherán, as in this last there #be thirteen #jewish that run the risk -know it-to be condemned to the pity of death simply for having been accused of espionage in favour of #Israel.
I am of the seem that #if we do not recognise the errors of the past, will not be able to advance in the future, and it is necessary to say that, in it fundamental, the question from now is #if we will be able, without resorting to the arms, to pipe the subjects related with the democratic transformations.
On 9 July 1999, #such as the Assembly will have heard to say to the Mr. *Sasi, the Council decided to remit the subject to the Court of Justice protecting in the article 213 of the Treaty; after said decision, now *le corresponds to the Court pronounce on the questions aroused.
It foresees besides a procedure of examination and of decision that include the specific capacity of the Commission to remit the question to a deontological committee *cuando the planned occupation of the commissioner was related with his wallet.
Perhaps the Assembly wish to know besides that, during the conversations of this month, #some members of the current Commission that always have respected fully his solemn commitment to fulfil the obligations of honesty and discretion have reiterated of fine wins and voluntarily said commitment.
It That *nos remains to *nosotros is to take a reflection about the fault of consideration of #some members of the salient Commission on the need to adopt a rigorous approach regarding the high exigible criteria in the public life.
The *desenvoltura of the Commissioner *Bangemann, that not even has had the decency to expect some months until the end of the agony of the Commission, *nos reveals until how point believe  in this institution above the laws and of the public opinions.
Really it is of it more *censurable that there #have been no only an apparent *mofa of the official norms for the commissioners, but also a rape of the spirit of transparency and confidence that had to constitute the base of the work among this Parliament and the commissioners.
After a deep debate, the Council reaffirmed  in his conclusions of the past June and remitted  to the common political will, so much of the Commission as of the countries members, to carry out the measures that require said conclusions in #all his amplitude and of immediate form.
The Council applauded in general lines the program proposed by the Commission, related with the deep review of the legislation, on #whose details are *ustedes to the common, and that pretends to be adapted to the legislation on foods of animal origin and to the measures to take regarding the animal wastes.
But it is clear that in the moment more *álgido of the crisis is absurd that the Commission and his technical services lose the time with discussions with the #belgian authorities and the technical services of #this, since there are not norms and since it do not knows  how much dioxin #can have any product.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, the crisis of the dioxin, after the crisis of the crazy cows, the American pressures directed to impose the meat with hormones, are examples of the fearsome threats that weigh today day on the alimentary security of our *conciudadanos.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, for me at least has been a comfort the that neither in this Assembly, neither in the European Commission, neither in the Council, nobody have considered the crisis of the #belgian dioxins like a purely #belgian problem.
Sure enough, the problem of the #belgian dioxins is also a #european problem, and the that it was a #european problem of course has to see with the only market, with the politics in matter of competition, with the failure of the agricultural politics.
We take into account that the necessary liberalisation of the markets and the opening to third countries are imposing to the agriculture and to the *ganadería #european some heights of competitiveness hardly *superables and that #if they do not take  effective preventive measures the career by *abaratar costs of production *nos will carry, before or afterwards, to a new similar case.
Lady Speaker, *nos says *usted that only treats  of modifications or of changes, but *nos #would enjoy that the Group of the European Socialists *nos said, in relation with his amendment 1, #if it treats  to add a nomination or of a change, and #would wish to have #the same answer in relation with the amendment 4 of the Group of the European Socialists.
A look in the that want *centrarme of it that has said the Mr. *Ford, is that the Commission, as it alleges, is issuing a message to the organisers of the European Union managers of the championships of *Europa 2000 and perhaps of the Glass of the World that they #can take case *omiso of the norms.
I want to urge to the Commission to that it show more prowess in front of the governments and to inform to the Parliament *cuando the governments hinder attitudes and clear decisions of the Commission through his dilatory behaviour, of his absence of decision or of the utilisation *improcedente and unsuitable of his influence.
It treats , of course, as it #can read in the conclusions of the report of the experts, further of the own bad operation, of a problem of mentality, that, obviously, do not puts in *entredicho to the civil servants of the Commission, but that reveals structural lacks of this institution, that are not of technical character, but of political order.
The control by the European Parliament, of course, and, for example, our Assembly #would have to, after this report of the experts, request new audits on concrete points, or even appoint an or varied commissions of investigation to launch light in #some fields still dark, like the evaluation of the real effects of the community subventions.
It is much better, in place to pretend an environmental inspection *supranacional, with #all the difficulties related with the right of entrance, that #can ensure that the valid legislation guarantee that the environmental inspectors of #all the States members (to) exist and (*b) carry out his tasks pretty much according to #the same guidelines.
And once again *nos find in front of a dilemma that is the authentic alternative of the devil: *cuando the European Commission proposes a recommendation *ustedes want a directive, and *cuando the Commission proposes a directive, it is necessary to take recommendations because it is necessary to respect the principle of subsidiariness.
To know the personality and the suitability of the candidates to exert his charges believe that the public audiences have been a positive exercise of democracy and transparency, without that they have triumphed the that pretended *convertirlas in a hunting of witches.
*Ello Only #would contribute to erode the confidence of the society in the institutions of the Union, it that #would suppose a step backwards for #all the parts interested, in particular, to the light of the decisive challenges that await to the Union like political and economic entity.
Gentleman President, the statement of the President designated of the Commission confirms his previous interventions, mainly in front of this Assembly, the days 13 April or 4 May last, and the #french deputies of my group will see  therefore forced to vote against.
Therefore, our more important priority #would have to be go back to achieve the participation of the constituent *desencantado: a European Commission reformed, a European Parliament reformed, that relate  of a firm way, but mature, is the only path by the that have #any real hope to achieve it.
To appeal of the groups, and especially of the #ours, the gentleman *Prodi has assumed clear commitments regarding the transparency of the actions of the Commission, to the *concertación with the Parliament, to the responsibility of the members of the Commission in front of this Assembly.
*Yo Wanted to require it following: in the first place, *yo did not have any intervention to the beginning of the session and, second, the precision of yesterday did not seems to have served of at all, since again it did not appears in the Record it that really said and the following point contradicts the content of my words.
Conscious that #that is the main task of the Commission, manifest to the professor *Prodi and to the members of the Commission the wish of a good work and declare that it will have the vote of the #portuguese deputies of the Popular Party European.
We have appreciated his introduction, expect that it give a positive answer to the sections of our resolution, and have confidence in the capacity of the Mr. *Prodi to direct the Commission of way responsible and expert.
The operation and the management of the Direction of Transports have been exemplary and believe that with his experience in the modernisation of the Party *Laborista of the Realm Joined, has the necessary aptitudes to undertake this work.
Determined opinions that #can *resumir of the following mood: in the first place, we know that *Europa has taken  from two strengths *dialécticamente constructive: #that that, conscious of the weight of the history, defend the *pervivencia and the force of the national State and #that #others that, with greater launch, think in a future of greater integration, #whose political definition still is not among *nosotros, and perhaps was #that #one of the advantages of this construction.
To win these resistances needs  originality and energy, Mr. President, and wish that have *usted of unseen reservations of these genders, as to judge by the speeches that until today *le have listened, #many of *nosotros think that no  *nos have provided sufficient indications of *ello, and especially do not warn indications that it exist the new mentality that  precise for *encarar so much the deep crisis of confidence in that it has  *sumido *Europa like the problems of the unemployment and the security.
Although these cuts is *algo usual in this stage of the budgetary procedure, this year come to add  to a substantial redistribution of 430 millions of euros in the category 4 - external actions - to fund the reconstruction of *Kosovo by value of 500 millions of euros.
In the bottom, gentleman President, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, *señorías, have to say that no *nos had seduced the preliminary draft of budget of the Commission. No *nos had seduced the preliminary draft of the Commission and *nos disillusioned the project of budget of the Council.
I want to ask to the Council that  *replantee his proposal and that guarantee that the representation of the European Parliament in this organ correspond to it that in reality is the European Parliament, is to say, that was reflection of #all the political strengths, #all the currents, #all the opinions that give  in this moment in *Europa.
Lady Speaker, the European Council of Colony had the unlucky idea -without that any national parliament *le have demanded, that *yo know, at all to the *respecto- to launch the preparation of a Letter of Rights Fundamental of the European Union.
The Cut occupies  of the question of the impunity and offers an impartial forum for the trials, with it that will help to facilitate the international tensions and to promote the peace and the security in the national plane and in the international.
Lady Speaker, *yo expect that, after the statement that has taken the Speaker in exercise of the Council, this Summit of *Tampere #can suppose a firm commitment of political will by part of the Union, #where collect  #all a series of orientations clear and precise that *nos allow to follow advancing.
In the previous term of office, this Parliament said yes to the Monetary Union, said yes to the social integration taking of the employment the centre and engine of the #european social politics, and now have to say also yes to a #european space of freedom, of security and justice.
Lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, Mrs. *Halonen, his speech, with the concrete proposals that has included, *me has satisfied especially because it reinforces the conviction that *Tampere #can really suppose a moment summit, an authentic milestone, a new impulse to the process of construction #european.
To similarity of my mates of the Party of the European Socialists, particularly attentive and *asiduos with occasion of the auditions of the candidates to Commissioners, *me congratulate of this procedure that offers #a lot of educations on the personality and the intentions of those who will be our privileged speakers.
Therefore, #if well I go to vote this midday without a state of spirit particular the investiture of this Commission *deseándole spirit and luck, inside some weeks will be particularly attentive to the program that will announce  for the year 2000 and the term of office.
In the agricultural sector has insisted  in the great orientations of the *PAC -Political Agricultural Common- and a greater liberalisation of the markets, keeping the injustices in the distribution of the supports and subventions, with clear damage for the familiar agriculture and of countries like *Portugal in the that predominate the small agricultural exploitations.
The silence of the Mr. *Prodi on the need to defend the social model European, his *consternadora abstemiousness and even his frequent omissions concerning a #european politics in *pro of the employment, his careful generalities on the institutional modification inspire more reservations.
My argument is that the President of the Commission, Roman *Prodi, obtained in May of the year in course the vote of an important majority of the European Parliament to carry out with a squad *intachable a wide program of reforms with seen to the necessary *saneamiento of the Commission.
Had account of the serious doubts on the professional aptitude of the #belgian #Philippe *Busquin and his consequent capacity to assume the wallet of Investigation, without forgetting the *sinfín of recriminations to the that have given place his muddy businesses, *Prodi #would have to have denied categorically to accept to this candidate!
It Bad is that in this moment *yo am not able to estimate #if with the *quinto budget *rectificativo will get to final of year or #if to December already will be with the *nº 7, which do not has to *extrañar #if it takes into account that the same Commission has contributed in his document of work assessments very different to the hour to motivate the resources required.
I appreciate to the #finnish Presidency the action that carries out in the Nations Joined on the question of the abolition of the pity of death and *me cheer a lot to know that, thanks to the #finnish Presidency -and no only to *ella, of course-, this year will have a resolution in New *York.
#One of the roads of management of this problem, necessary although no only, is the help to the refugees, without damage that in the frame of the negotiations of peace reach  a permanent solution further of the therapeutic of the help.
The Council has proposed an ineffective procedure, by it that pray that they comprise that we accept the headquarters in *Tesalónica like operative part, like a part of the Agency of Reconstruction for the whole of the *Sudeste of *Europa with headquarters in *Tesalónica, but that it has to be linked very closely to the headquarters of the pact of stability in *Tesalónica.
The deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations consider that in this field of the accidental marine pollution, the existence of a true common interest justifies the creation of a community frame.
In effect, these three programs at present do not establish any action in this sector and is not desirable to favour a dispersion of the means, in detriment of the programs *prioritarios for the economic development of next countries to the European Union, candidates to the adhesion.
For *nosotros, the body of control #european has to follow being the current, is to say, a body that allow to check, to his time, #if the bodies of control of the States members apply the community regulation, to avert, of course, distortions of competition among the different States members.
The resolution that finishes to approve the European Parliament on the preparation of a Letter of the fundamental rights of the Union illustrates perfectly the risk that they produce  unfit, as I reported in my intervention of yesterday, during the main debate.
In the meantime, the decision on an answer to the speculations and allegations of bad utilisation of the bottoms of help is, mainly, responsibility of the #FMI, the World-wide Bank and the countries of the *G7, since they are #this obviously the main providers of the direct financial help.
Gentleman President, do not want to interrupt the debate but like this debate and the explanation of the Commissioner *Kinnock have to  to the urgent wish of #some political groups, wanted to *rogarle that transmit also to the Conference of the Presidents the wish that said political groups have present at least a minimum of deputies.
#If we want to follow investing in the #russian economy, have to find the means to support and develop the local economic activity - as it finishes to say our colleague - so that it attend to the needs of the population and provide a feeling of stability and of participation.
Has to ask  to the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in *Europa that present a report to our Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The present conjoint appeal of diverse political groups pretends especially that it #can obtain  it before possible and of reliable mood an information of this type.
In that occasion were reasonable and *nos put of agreement. Now our task is the to help to the persons that there live in his development, that perhaps #can pass of similar mood but that in any case *les open a future in the that it was ensured his existence and in the that they #can take his destination in his own hands.
Still they are cool in the memory the murders committed in autumn of the year happened on four independent minds and, of course, do not is necessary to forget the extraordinarily brutal performance of the gang of bullies of the conservative faction of the *jurisconsulto supreme *Khamenei.
This apparent contempt by the international obligations is #one of the main obstacles so that they improve the relations among the ancient Republic of *Yugoslavia and the European Union, and an obstacle also for the reintegration of the ancient Republic in the international community.
In terms of political support, the European Union proposes  continue and encourage the efforts that already has undertaken our special representative for the Great Lakes with seen to facilitate the necessary grade of dialogue among the different factions that take part in the conflict of the *RDC.
*Me #Would enjoy that the space that surrounds to the Living room of Plenaries considered  part of *él, so that neither the houses, neither the assistants, neither the representatives of the groups of pressure or the members of the public *nos block the exit and *nos prevent to get to our offices.
To #all *nos concerns the good use of the money of the #european taxpayer and *yo regret sincerely the rage of the #dutch colleague that, against of #all idea of solidarity #european, has considered timely to assume the defence of "his" taxpayers.
I understand, lady Speaker, that there #be had an orator in favour of the proposal and another orator, that finishes to incorporate  to his seat, that has presented the idea to celebrate a debate on this subject to final of month, in the second partial period of sessions of October.
The Council and the Commission wanted to take the measure of this restlessness, but in the actuality seem little able to provide other different solutions to some regulations *puntillosas but pusillanimous, that the most cunning and the less *escrupulosos will follow evading in detriment of the alimentary security.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, every time results clearer that the problem of the public health and the healthy feeding is a true #european problem, a world-wide problem, and that is not the problem of a solo Been member.
#If like this we take it, I believe that we will be able to *decirles to our citizens and our citizens: at all it #can  guarantee with security in the life, but *les are offering the maximum grade of security, welfare and health that at present *les #can offer from the point of sight of the human possibilities and the scientific recommendations.
Now well, *nos have *enterado with stupor that, against of the opinion of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, the budget for the AIDS #would have reduced  to the half, which #would be a scandal, in front of the urgency of the situation, and contradictory with the words of the gentleman *Nielson.
And -it that is not less important- is *usted had to procure the cooperation with the pharmaceutical companies, by a part, to accelerate the work with seen to the #obtaining of a vaccine and, second, manufacture medicines more accessible for the poor of this world?
During the debate around the question of the employment of the condom also have taken fine note of the wide existent consensus on the decisive importance to put to disposal of the population cheap condoms and *informarles of precise and honest form, as it has *sucedido in *Tanzania, *Uganda and *Senegal.
We believe that *eso *nos #would pose a difficulty of respect of the budgetary authority and to analyse the subjects of form *parcelada, of #such form that #can not have a global vision of the difficulties that  *nos #can pose.
The evaluation showed also that the actions with charge to *SAVE *propiciarán also indirectly the achievement of the goals of the program of investigation and innovation in matter of energy no nuclear by means of the creation of a half positive for the diffusion and the application of the new technologies in matter of renewable energies.
Since up to now it has reached  an improvement of the energetic efficiency of the 1% annual, roughly, in the final consumption, the Commission advocates #one dip of reduction of the energetic intensity in the final demand of a point *porcentual more to the year.
#If the European Union was not able to guarantee these principles, #would lose entirely the face in the negotiations that in brief go  initiate in the field of the Round of the #Millenium of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
As it sees , the respect of the values and the cultural preferences requires a strict application of the principle of subsidiariness, *conque have to respect also the cultural differences on the system of information of the different States members.
How measured has adopted the Commission and #which thinks to adopt in the future to apply the common Action and Resolution on light arms adopted by the Council and *subsiguientemente the Resolution of the Council of Development of the EU on light arms?
Gentleman Commissioner, this question forms part of an electoral setting organised by the Working Socialist Party Spanish to the thread of the electoral campaign of the past #european elections to attack to the then head of list of the Popular Party, *Loyola of Palace.
Also they pretended to accuse to the then Minister of Agriculture of a supposed fraud in the adjudication of the helps, but results that the competition of control and payment of the helps of the *PAC is of the regional governments, according to the cast of competitions of the #spanish State.
Besides, also we have tried to create the necessary conditions for the advance of the process of peace, for the distention of the situation and so that  satisfied an environment of opinion favourable to this process.
The help to the development and the technical assistance in subjects like the agreement of zones stable and the operation of the Administration have been the fields to the that it has allocated  and will follow allocating our help.
*Permítame Likewise express my gratitude to the Committee of Development and Cooperation and to #all the Parliament by the thorough report and by his support, in the frame of the procedure of query, to the efforts of the Commission for *ultimar the agreement.
Gentleman President, #all celebrate the relaunching of the process of peace in Orient Next; without embargo, know that the history and the circumstances of the conflict are dramatic and that, along the years, diverse initiatives, that seemed to open a future of hope, have finished blocked owing to the *intransigencia, fault of political will or *cortedad of watch of #one of the parts.
The agreements recognise the right of the Palestinians to the self-determination, in the frame of a State, but also guarantee the right of #Israel to live in a frame of security inside some safe borders and recognised.
With this end, have elaborated  two strategies in the frame of two programs *plurianuales complementary that form part of the program mark of actions in the sector of the energy: *SAVE *II (boost a more effective utilisation of the energy) and *Altener *II (boost the renewable energies).
Of course, I have taken note of the disposals contained in the section 2 of the article 23 of the agreement, that allow to take measures of control or of *salvaguardia in case that the economic development of "the most #move# away regions of the European Union" suffered a grave deterioration.
It is necessary to take into account that the posture of the EU of a wide round has to be harmonised with the posture of States Joined, favourable to an approach by sectors that contemplate the reduction of tariffs, and with the most reserved posture of the countries in roads of development.
The inclusion of the competition in the agenda of the *OMC do not pretends to transform #this last in a world-wide authority of the competition, but fix, simply, a body of principles and of procedures allocated to promote the application of politics of internal competition, compatible among himself/hisself.
Gentleman President, in name of the Group *ELDR, wanted to signal our firm support to the efforts of the European Commission and of the Council to persuade to our international speakers of the virtues of a new round of wide negotiations in the breast of the *OMC that cover a big variety of subjects.
This wave of liberalisation justifies , obviously, in name of the general interest and of the employment, as *usted has affirmed it during his audition, gentleman *Lamy, indicating that to the Community *le interests the progressive opening of the markets, so much for the commodities as for the services.
Perhaps, gentleman Commissioner, the Commission together with the American Administration #can present *algún type of green Book in the that  *esboce where root the differences and where the common interests among States Joined and *Europa, because as it knows of his previous function, unless States Joined and *Europa reach an agreement on the main guidelines in an international round like #this, will not finish never.
It treats , especially, to take get in #all moment to the negotiator of the European Union the problems that this round poses to our citizens, as it has seen  already by the that have taken part before, and the solutions that these citizens sue of the negotiators.
Gentleman President, wish first of all formulate a question to the Council and to the Presidency, referent to the transparency: when it will transmit  to the European Parliament the project of statement final that the #finnish Presidency has presented to the Council?
Gentleman President, #can not  stand out sufficiently the economic importance and for the employment of the Round of the #Millenium and of the world-wide trade for the #european economy, that is the commercial partner more important of the world.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, support the present conjoint resolution of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer and, to the contrary that #others of my political group, support also the passage on the tax on the broadcasts of CO2.
The *CDU in *Alemania -have debated it takes little with our President, the Mr. *Schäuble- do not believes that because the Government *roji-green commit #such *sinsentidos to national level on the subject of the ecological tax, have to to leave to follow working in finding a #european solution.
We are in front of an increasing importance of the structural Bottoms, fundamentally, but results that in #some countries this money that gets of the structural Bottoms is used by the Been member under pretext that it employs it in programs *plurianuales, of #such way that the money that gets to the autonomous communities, to the regions, is a money *minorizado.
In base to this article, the Central Banks of the no included countries in the zone of the euro paid in concept of costs of operation of the #ECB a five percent of the total of the part that *les corresponded in the subscription of the capital.
In this line, the Council, that no the Commission, gentleman President, adopted in 1998, in this line of conservation of the resources, a relative decision to the progressive disappearance of the networks of mesh to the derive, also designated "*volantas" .
Gentleman President, after the referendum on the Law of Concord National, celebrated in *Argelia on 16 September 1999, the #finnish Presidency, in name of the European Union, issued a communiqué that answers by himself/hisself same to the question formulated by the Mrs. deputy.
*Ustedes Know that *Moscú has gone back to recognise and to activate the council *pseudoparlamentario that had signed and that had established  before the #alto the fire and in this way, by his part, has broken brutally the agreement that had concluded  under the supervision of the *OSCE.
We have to explore #a lot of different forms -perhaps unforeseen forms- to resolve the problems of logistics that poses the provision of assistance to the persons that the need, but is difficult to promise a concrete form to act in this case.
*B5-0155/1999 of the Mr. *Schori, in name of the Group of the *PSE, on the vote of a resolution by the General Assembly of the Nations Joined on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of the capital penalties;
*B5-0159/1999 of the Mr. *Manisco, #among others, in name of the Group *GUE/*NGL, on the vote of a resolution by the General Assembly of the Nations Joined on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of the capital penalties;
As it occurs after the debates in the breast of the Council, run the danger to obtain a feeble text, a simple reproduction of the that have been approved during these three last years in Gin and that no *nos allow to continue this battle, that do not establish new terms, neither mechanisms that allow to check the steps and the progresses made.
The #serbian, the #gipsy, the Egyptians, the Muslims are the victims of this attempt of cleansing ethnic that, from takes months, the strengths of the *UÇK are carrying out systematically, and for *ello serve  of the presence of the strengths of the NATO and of the *KFOR.
As well, immediately afterwards, in the following days, in the following weeks, in the following years, there was an extraordinary criminal action oriented to hide the proofs, to *silenciar and to achieve that it did not know  the truth.
Besides, the Commission estimated that it was better to entrust this work to *Eurocontrol and no to a community organ, because the national governments perhaps trip with less difficulties to allow that this organisation exert this function concerning the military utilisation of the aerial space.
Always regarding the session of the Thursday, the Group of the Popular Party European requests to advance to the Thursday the oral question on the agreement *pesquero among the European Union and *Marruecos, foreseen in the agenda of the Friday.
In the last days #a lot of Europeans have seen with big indignation and stupor, that in a country with the that *nos join bows of friendship and to the that the Europeans, and especially my country, have so much that appreciate, is to say, in the States Joined of *América, is possible still, to the protect of the Law, carry in front of the courts to boys -and no *me refer to youngsters of 17 or of 18 years, but to boys of 11 and of 10 years- and *sacarlos of his houses manacled and with *grilletes in the feet.
Now well, when reading my references and the of varied deputies of my Group, do not see the name of my party or of my Group, *Europa of the Nations, but a totally subjective assessment: opposite nationalist to the European Union.
Lady Speaker, in relation with #the same question of the reception of programs television that has posed my colleague the Mrs. *Plooij-go *Gorsel, wanted to express the hope that the technical problems that at present prevent the reception of BBC1 and BBC2 #can resolve .
Nowadays, talk of the community contributions is to talk the majority of the times that the poor of the rich countries see  taxed with taxes that *redundan in benefit of the rich of the poor countries and thus #any of *nosotros wants to carry out a politics of cast, and fundamentally #this *sucede through the numerous diets of community help.
Therefore, I celebrate to a large extent, and to *ello has referred  already in brief the orator that *me has preceded, that the directive no only contemplate to the persons that find  precisely in the interior of the cabin of an installation of transport by wire, but also to those persons that descend in the seasons or that expect the game.
As it has said  it takes some moments, opens  the path to the competition in this sector that, in the field of the technology and of the security, purchases a fundamental look because the competition is it that it is: it serves to improve the technician.
Now well, from my point of sight, how doubt fits that the technical disposals that will follow this directive and that will establish  in other forums and after other meetings, will constitute the fundamental element to define the permission of this directive in #all the States members.
For *nosotros is essential that the speaker and the speaker for the year 2001 study in *algún moment how parts exactly belong to the part To of the budget and how parts belong to the part *B. And I am talking especially of the category To 30. When an organisation of help #can resort to the #european bottoms?
To #that *respecto, want to manifest no only a deep disagreement with the horizontal reductions and *indiscriminadas that proposes the Council for this category, but also affirm the agreement in general with the strategy that *nos proposes the speaker and that, in it essential, goes directed to a review of the Financial Perspectives to end to give answer to new priorities, without that thus they result affected previous goals.
The Commission of Rights of the Woman presented, the same that the past year, a comment and a budget for the line To-3037, corresponding to the *Lobby European of Women, but the comment says now that this line remains opened for #all the no governmental organisations.
By #this have to procure boost the innovation in the schools, have to strengthen the initiative, the innovation in the centres of education -from the primary school until the university-, so as to generate a new impulse and open also new opportunities in this field.
Since the information that contains the annual report is of nature *autoexplicativa, perhaps result more useful to centre my observations here and now in #some of the subjects that treat  in the project of resolution elaborated by his Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary.
In *tercer place, the #ECB had to debate of periodic form the evolution in each #one of the States members of the zone of the euro for like this have a positive influence on the evolution of the prices and the wages that, #such as it has signalled aptly the Mr. *Duisenberg, have to vary of a Been member to #another.
In the first place, the no self-evident report, to my seem, so much by his content as in his editorial, a sufficient will by part of the Central Bank European to subject  to the democratic control of the European Parliament.
It exists the suspicion, better said, more that the suspicion, that this decision took  by political pressures - think, for example, to *Oskar *Lafontaine - and that, through the approval of today, the Parliament pretends to confirm the tendency to a Central Bank subordinated to the requirements of the politics or even of the electoral interests.
But, as I said it takes #some days in front of the General Assembly of the Nations Joined, do not want a peace to any price, but a peace that strengthen really the democracy, that preserve the territory and that allow to each #one of the citizens the full exercise of #all his rights and freedoms.
The central decision in the creation of the space of justice #european has been to establish like base of the cooperation the mutual recognition of the decisions and judicial sentences, so much in subjects of civil right, as of penal right.
The decisions of the Council do not contain #any another appointment on the mood to deliver, inside the Union, the derivative economic charges of the refugees and of the applicants of asylum.
Regarding the relative measures to the right of asylum and to the immigration, result totally indeterminate and little *apremiantes; the only fine news is the respect of the Agreement of Gin and the reaffirmation of the fight against the racism.
I subscribe fully the statement issued by the leaders of the EU *cuando expressed his deep to weigh in front of the decision of the Senate of the States Joined of not ratifying the Treaty of Prohibition Complete of the Nuclear Essays.
Under this look and taking into account the decision of the relative Council to the competitions of the Agency, #would have to get  to agreements to reach of durable mood a reconciliation in the whole of the *Balcanes and establish some links with the pact of stability.
The subject of the asylum, the immigration and the delinquency *transfronteriza, #as well as the administration of justice *repercuten on the fundamental subjects of the human rights and the civil rights of the individual.
Gentleman President, the results of the summit of *Tampere *me seem a basically positive signal for the citizens of the European Union because they put on of the table question that *nos affect to #all, but, especially, because they open the door to the development of some politics that demand the own citizens.
Gentleman President, do not fits doubt that the Council of *Tampere is a qualitative jump in the path to the #european integration and that in this work, has been very important the contribution of the #finnish Presidency, to the *cual *le give my more cordial *enhorabuena.
By a part, measures *intergubernamentales, directly executable road plans of action, but essentially directed to brake the immigration. On the other hand, mandates directed to the European Commission, regarding the politics of asylum common and the protection of the applicants of asylum.
It wanted to, gentleman President, express our gratitude to the Prime minister #Jean-*Luc *Dehaene, to the President *von *Weizsäcker and to *Lord #Simon by the quality of his contribution and give the graces also to His *Señorías, here, by his received and by the attention that loan to his report, in particular in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, lively and chaired by the Mr. *Napolitano.
Although #if they stopped  to think a moment, #would not take in giving  account that his country, any country, probably lose more of the vetos issued by other countries that it that win taking use of the own in #a lot of fields of competition of the European Union.
In the questions related with the reform of the institutions, remits  to a concept *tecnográfico of increase of the efficiency and of capacity of performance without throwing at least a glimpse to the so necessary and urgent question of the construction of a #european democracy.
I am very appreciated by this opportunity that  *me offers to comment the amendments of the Parliament and *permítanme take advantage of the opportunity to present my respects to his *Señoría and to his colleagues for having  taken so much interest in this so important subject.
The *segunda question that has given place to a series of amendments is the wish to situate the Agency under the only and direct responsibility of the Commission, that #would be the manager to appoint to his director.
The previous rule was abolished and, in consequence, is urgent to adopt a position regarding the procedures of modification of the distinct norms that go approving, especially in those important and delicate matters, #this is, #if it has to prevail the opinion, the opinion of the Commission or of the Council.
In effect, believe that, #if well it is necessary to cheer that the advances of the computer facilitate the commercial exchanges, no thus it is necessary to leave to be watchdogs and watch by a just balance among the interests of the borrowers of services and the protection of the consumers.
Until the day of today in the European Union there #be an institutional frame that consists in two directives: the directive on the collective dismissals and the directive on the #european commission of the company.
The only possible politics for the full employment of the #european workers is the of *reconquistar the inner market, protect it against the disloyal competition, renounce to #one *mundialización criminal and antisocial; it is the to reestablish the necessary norm of the community preference.
*Permítanme, first of all, hail the fact that there #be practically unanimity among the Council, the Commission, and expect that the Parliament, on a so crucial subject in a moment in the that we have to give decisive steps in the configuration of an external politics and of common security.
The value and the judicial independence of the judge *Gimblett - the value of #Angela *Zelter and of his mates contrast strongly with the *petulante rejection by part of the American Senate of the Treaty of prohibition total of the nuclear proofs.
The Russians, *comprensiblemente, are showing a big interest by the process of enlargement, and the European Union is had to undertake a serious dialogue with *ellos in the frame of the Agreement of Association and Cooperation.
Especially, it provides a human face to the far bureaucratic politics #european, plants to the citizens in the central point of the performances and of the debate, #such as it occurs in the program "Youth" and in the program of training "#Socrates" .
On the other hand, we agree with the Council in the need that the actions of Culture 2000 are visible for the public opinion, but the best way to achieve it are the small performances or the average, the disperse, the near to the citizens, and no the great events.
It #would consider especially unaware that the Parliament did not follow the recommendations of the speaker, since it #can not  follow saying that it is regrettable that every time vote less persons in the #european elections or that it is *desconsolador that of each survey result that *Europa is increasingly far of the Europeans and, go  to save in those projects that, precisely, have like goal *acercar *Europa to the persons.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, on 28 August 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a resolution of the European Parliament and of the Council with the goal to introduce the common program of action "Youth" for the period comprised among the 2000 and the 2004.
Regarding analysing the factors that have boosted or *entorpecido the social integration of the youngsters, consider fundamental to include an analysis of the influence of the family or of the fault of family in the development of the youngsters.
As it has posed  this question, wanted to signal concerning the relative information to the Young "programs" that the network *Eurodesk, that is a combination of spots in Internet and councils for the youngsters, is available in #all the countries and in #all the tongues of the Union.
Said commitment no only has deserved the agreement of the Commission of Budgets, but also the of the competent commission for the bottom, especially with the support of the Mrs. *McNally, his speaker, to the one who give the graces by his cooperation.
From the point of sight, no of my political Group, but of the previous Parliament, of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, that approved by unanimity this report, really, there #be not any fault of clarity.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0026/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [13328/2/1998 - *C5-0023/1999 - 1998/0169(*COD)] with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes  an only instrument of finance and of programming in favour of the cultural cooperation (Program "Culture 2000" ) (Speaker: Mr. *Graça *Moura)
Alas the position of the Council did not favours neither the democratic freedoms neither the human rights in *Turquía; neither neither the solution of the problem of *Chipre, neither the of the question *kurda; neither neither the support to the tragic victims of the earthquakes registered in *Turquía.
Therefore, in spite of having full consciousness that the progression of the community costs is sometimes difficult to bear by the public finances of the States members, have voted in favour of the resolution proposed by the general speaker of the budget.
. (OF) The delegation of the Liberal Party Austrian will refuse in his whole the proposal of resolution of the Mr. *Bourlanges (Section *III - Commission) #as well as the of the Mr. *Virrankoski (other sections), since the budget did not fulfils the basic criteria of transparency and efficiency.
As it has said the Mr. #Gil-Oaks, and *yo had said previously, *nos find at present in a situation in the that the institutional agreement, regarding the *OLAF, applies  to the Commission, to the Council and to the personnel of this Institution, but did not applies  to the deputies of this Institution.
It is true that in the Agreement *interinstitucional talks  explicitly of the members of the institutions, but *cuando reads  this expression in his context, *nos give account that it treats  rather of salaried members, like the members of the Commission, and that the disposals adopted do not adapt  to members chosen, like the deputies to the European Parliament.
The *insensibilidad and the cynicism no only are accepted by the EU and his organs, but that they are besides funded in the frame of a politics of reinforcements economic direct or indirect #whose goal is the competitiveness in the world-wide field.
It is to say, gentleman *Fischler, on 1 December will lose his employment 7.000 #european fishermen, 477 community fuselages will remain tied up in our ports, 10.000 places of work in the industries *conserveras and of transformation will be in danger, and #others #a lot of thousands of employments more, related with the commercialisation and with the port activities, also *peligrarán.
But also because, to these heights, the unemployment of the activities *pesqueras seems unavoidable, it that forces, as it occurred in the moment of the expiration of the previous agreement, to look for extraordinary community bottoms to fund the time of stop of the fleet.
But yes I want to insist in that, by #all these so known reasons, the fleet is in *vilo, and as also *ella has to pay an every time greater part of the agreements of fishing, already has declared that it is not had to not receiving information of it that happen during these negotiations.
We conceded to *Marruecos a commercial agreement without limit of term and obtained an agreement of fishing with limit of term: it that means that *Marruecos plants to will his products in the territory of the European Union, but *nosotros only #can fish in the #moroccan waters until 30 November 1999.
In this moment, are treating of the future of the neighbouring countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental by means of his incorporation to the European Union, but also have to *preocuparnos by the future of the neighbouring countries of the bank south of the Mediterranean.
By it other, the Committee of Experts #british do not impugns these figures that were repeated by the director of the public health in *Escocia, that declared: "have present the fact that in this country exists a risk for the human health".
Gentleman President, first of all wanted to affirm that I am in favour of the principle of caution in a field #where the health of the consumers is directly loomed, but the debate that here takes place among the adherents and the opponents of the embargo is of a total hypocrisy.
On the other hand, this Protocol supposes a natural step until the signature of the new Agreement, that #can run risks given the political situation of the country and the presence of other fleets #if the European Union  *ausentara of the zone.
In the last seven years the taxpayers of the European Union have paid 1.400 millions of euros to his Governments and to other institutions and, even with the neutral words of the Commission, is difficult to control the destination that gives  to this money.
And I disagree absolute and radically of the posture of the orator that *me has preceded in the use of the word, the one who has manifested a politics very little *solidaria with the States members of the European Union, very little *solidaria with the fishermen, a posture that is, fortunately, minoritary in this Assembly.
To begin, wanted to inform to His *Señorías on the *dictamen adopted by unanimity by the Managerial Committee Scientist the past Friday and based in the scientific foundations of the *dictamen of the French Agency of Security of the Alimentary Health (*AFSSA) concerning the applicable measures to the exports of meat of bovine #british.
The plan of export according to a calendar established conceived by the Commission with the advice of the scientists is, in my opinion and in the of other scientists that advise to the Commission in these subjects, the that will give this security to the consumers.
It fits to stand out that the change of diet introduced from the set up of the Economic and Monetary Union has facilitated the task of the managers of the politics *macroeconómicas national and is helping to surpass these obstacles, so that the growth #can be more durable.
With regard to the diagnostic on the *coyuntura, #all the participants agreed in that the perspectives have improved of significant form, and in that the negative external crash of the year 1998 seems that it has absorbed  already with the internal development of the own European Union.
Regarding the economic politics -the second document already gives answer to the challenge that constitutes to transform the circumstantial backstitch in a durable process of growth higher-, each #one of the participants exposed his point of sight of form very frank.
In the budgetary procedure have found #all class of means to reach an agreement of work so that this institution, together with the Commission, keep the confidentiality and #can take  the same in the case of this dialogue.
It is a social catastrophe even in the countries of *Europa that affirm to have less unemployed and, watches by where, the European Council of Colony and the European Commission content  with *atiborrarse with words talking of #european pact in *pro of the employment, but, had account of the amplitude of the problem, the planned measures are ridiculous.
Of #the same mood, wanted to take part next Monday in the political debate on #which will be the effects of the rise of types of interest, that predictably will produce  tomorrow, and no only of the effects on the types of *cotización of the day, but also the effects on the real economy.
It wanted to underline that the goal of the dialogue *macroeconómico, #such as it outlined  also in Colony, has in his core the need to combine the development and the employment. And debate and apply for the first time a #european politics for the employment is #one of the most important questions of the *Europa of today.
The two parts of the industry accepted to be included in the general directive, as long as they reached  parallel advances in the sector of the transport by road, because, as it is natural, fear to suffer a disadvantage in matter of competition, #if they establish disposals very wide on the labour day and the sector of the transport by road do not takes it own.
The labour day for more of a chamber of million of doctors in period of training in the European Union is a question of health and security for the own doctors, that have to have #the same rights to *salvaguardar his health and his personal life that #that to the that treat.
I believe that #everyone in this Assembly #would receive with *beneplácito the opportunity to give a very positive and affirmative vote in favour of the proposals presented by the Mrs. *Smith in his report concerning the reduction of the transitory period to four years.
*Cuando Formulated  the directive on the labour day of 1993, some sectors remained excluded of his field of application and the reason is very clear: the own specific characteristics of #some of the sectors interested required a legislation that took into account said characteristic and particular needs.
. (*SV) Gentleman President, is obvious that it is an enormous event the that the EU celebrate the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical with the Popular Republic of Chinese, since #all know that Chinese is a big country that goes to decide a fine part of our common future.
Besides, His *Señoría has talked, with reason, of the question of the private companies and think also, as His *Señoría, that the presence of companies in the project of collaboration is an element stood out in #all the program-mark and that results particularly important in this type of agreement.
The European Economic Community and the Argentinian Republic have #a lot of interest in collaborating in the mutual help because, without damage that Argentinian is a young country, *yo believe that it is very important that #all this Latin American area associate  fully to the *quinto programs frame of investigation and technological development.
And inside this strategic goal, treats  to achieve, among the operative goals, the boost the employment and ensure the coordination of the social protection and #all the field of the protection of the rights of the citizens.
The strategic document subjected to our examination represents, without place to doubts, an important step in the only market and expands and consolidates the idea of an only market that it is #one of the fundamental cores in the #european construction.
To this *respecto, the Mr. *Harbour and the other members of this Parliament #can be safe that the Commission seeks to be *responsive *and flexible, for saying it with the words of the Mr. *Harbour, so that this flexibility *nos allow to confront the needs of the moment without losing of sight the interests of the consumer.
I do not want *referirme now of way *particularizada to the conclusions, without embargo to the sight of the debate that took place yesterday in the Plenary about the dialogue *macroeconómico wanted to mention a point: the European Parliament #would have to be included also in the preparation and put in practice of the #european pact on the employment.
The majority of the proposals that the Commission of Rights of the Woman and *yo have presented already has approved  by the commission, but a pair of subjects essential were refused, in particular the amendments 37, 38 and 39.
Instead, a committee, a committee *apolítico runs the risk to be a house of compensation in that it treats  to subtract *dramatismo to the debate, to find political alternatives that exist in virtue of a precisely neutral consensus and *apolítico to the that believe that it is impossible to get in matter of employment.
The goal announced with the introduction of the only coin seem to be the to establish the confidence in the economic politics through the stability of the monetary politics, of prices and budgetary, #as well as by means of the moderation *salarial and the flexibility.
Without embargo, today the dialogues *macroeconómicos national have moved  to the regional field; the *concertación has involved the regions and the territory and his capacity of programming in the utilisation of the structural instruments and in conceiving models of local development.
Likewise, it reserves  a fundamental paper to the social speakers in the strategies of employment and of social integration and do not exists still a clear definition of the paper of #the same, especially in his facet of organisations no governmental.
Gentleman President, the figures of the unemployment and of the poverty in *Europa follow being catastrophic: sixty millions of poor, a 9% of unemployed, a 25% of juvenile unemployment; it is not precisely it that says  a positive balance, especially taking into account that the calm of 1999 has to  more that swims to an improvement of the *coyuntura in the that neither the governments, neither the European Union have had at all that see.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, as it #can check  in the reports on the politics of employment of the States members, there #be a high *incumplimiento of the guidelines on the employment and the levels of unemployment keep  very elevated -in particular, in the of long length-, it that affects especially to the youngsters and to the women.
By this reason, consider important the two parts that now are *resumidas in the Report *Menrad as, by a part, the peace and the security and, by #another, the growth and the employment constitute the supreme priority of the politics of the European Union.
In *tercer place, have to promote the innovation in the field of the training, as with his training #a lot of youngsters and also #a lot of unemployed of long length do not find occupation in this market of work by *carecer still of the necessary qualification for the new technical developments.
To day of today the lines guidelines for the employment have debated  in the Commission of Employment and in the Commission of Subjects Economic, and keep  intense conversations to get to the Council, #where believe that they will adopt  without reservations and will debate  officially on 29 November, in the mixed Council of Ministers of Economy and Ministers of Work.
#If it applies  #the same norm to the small Groups that to the great, or to the great Groups that to the small, do not believe that *ello carry to the conclusion that it #would suit to dissolve the Group *PPE by the fact that #such or *cual national faction have in this Parliament of independence of vote.
We take note of the indication of the European Parliament to link the fiscal incentives to the companies "so that they contribute really to the creation of places of work and no to the restructurings and to the *deslocalizaciones that involve dismissals" , so as to not repeating the scandal of the company *Michelin.
To this *respecto, the new section 2 of the article 299 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, when recognising the peculiarities of the #french departments of *Ultramar like regions *ultraperiféricas of the Union, *nos offers the possibility to adopt measures of exception to the community right in benefit of his development.
The political call "of employment" will remain in the best of the cases reduced to #some vain sentences, in the worst of the cases will follow serving of pretext to subsidise to the in depth #stray companies, whereas they will not take  authoritarian measures to forbid that the great #european companies suppress put of work while have benefits.
The fact that, precisely in this field, the #european States grouped in the Union refuse to adopt measures *vinculantes shows that his main worry is the to go clearing the obstacles, included the social, so that the great companies take out the maximum benefit, and in no way to put end to the unemployment.
The Group of the Greens and the Group of the Party of the European Socialists request that it inscribe  in the agenda, of the 9 to the 10 hours, the presentation of the annual report of the Court of Accounts.
Lady Speaker, believe that it is a question that explains  by himself/hisself alone in the measure in that we already debate in the previous Plenary the importance that the Parliament adopted the norms of development and application of an agreement *interinstitucional, that has been already *concertado in the past term of office and ratified by the Parliament.
Perhaps, so that our colleagues have clear the subject, as it argued  in the Conference of Presidents, #can require  that, given the predictable absence of the Mr. *Patten, have suggested the name of the Mr. *Verheugen no to personal title, but because it is #one of the Commissioners that devote  to the international subjects.
In my opinion, the Speaker of the report, *Lange, is entirely in it true *cuando proposes to carry the question of the heavy vehicles to the sphere of a common strategy to reduce what before the broadcast of CO2 in the roads.
Now there are car industries that for the values limit of *NOx more strict take like point of reference the 2005, the first reading of the European Parliament. #Others take the reference of the 2008, the common position of the Council, and #others the of the 2006, the proposal of review for the *segunda reading.
The Council of Ministers of Environment adopted on 20 December of the year happened some valuable amendments of our colleague *Hautala, that consisted in #one value strict limit to combat the pollution and the broadcast of particles *cancerígenas of the heavy vehicles.
Finally, it wanted to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner *António *Vitorino, that was in the Summit of *Tampere, for *pedirle that *nos say how goes  to concretise, in the practice, the final decision of the Council, that applaud, of *tipificar like penal offence the violence against the human beings, in particular against the boys and the women.
As we have seen in the debate precedent, the Commission already is working in varied relative fields to the boys, although the competition of the action in the majority of the important spheres of these fields follows in hands of the States members.
It did not argue  in the table of negotiations on the directive that are talking and wanted to answer also to the question of the Mrs. *Ghilardotti on #which are the data on the that still there are doubts and the data in the that there #be disagreement among the national Parliaments.
In the *primer report of March has exposed  #all a series of questions positive, an ecological tax, a tax on the broadcasts of CO2, a tax on the *gravamen of speculative benefits in the short term and the benefits of the #ECB.
#If the European Union decides, by a democratic procedure, that the own resources are simply a direct percentage of the #GDP collected by the States members and transferred in a global quantity, as very well: *eso will be the own resources and will be democratic.
These changes, #as well as the reinforcement of the budgetary discipline, that is visible so much in the conclusions of the Presidency of *Berlín, as in the new Agreement *Interinstitucional, provide the basic stimuluses for the need to modify and complete the valid decision with new mechanisms.
I say it because in the Agreement *interinstitucional appear as merely *indicativos and out of the financial perspectives, in the Annex *II; it only that they are financial perspectives is the Annex *I. Instead, the proposal of the Commission includes some costs that do not form part of the financial perspectives inside the guideline.
In this context want to say also that in brief *deliberaremos in the commission with big detail together with the Commission on how additional regulations are necessary in the sector of the electrical current and of the gas, as against of #all the affirmations made follow without having still a #european market but 15 different markets.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, the Mr. *Chichester has declared with #a lot of tarpaulin in his report, that the environmental approach has to contain a better energetic politics that the of before, but assuming the States members a basic responsibility in accordance with this principle, fundamental in matter of energetic politics.
Like private lawyer that exerts the profession in the Realm Joined, with frequency have had to *lidiar with a battery of books to find the pertinent norms and the ideal form to proceed in name of my customers in these circumstances.
The boy has to have the possibility to be listened in front of the Court to show like this clearly that it takes into account his welfare and expect that the solution of commitment of my colleague *Watson do not believes here additional problems and that we #can regulate this important subject in favour of the boy.
The #european construction has ignored during too much time the right of the persons, and the *Europa of the citizens, #whose expression are *nosotros, has to take into account from now on, said it yesterday in the afternoon with reason of the *X anniversary of the international Agreement, the concrete worries of the families and the welfare of the boys.
The amendment *nº 3, except better opinion, do not contributes at all new to the disposal, in the measure in that the States members that will designate an only authority, is to say, a central authority, are precisely the that in his right do not admit the direct transmission of decisions.
*Señorías, the regulation foresees a term of four months for the presentation of the plans of development economic by part of the national authorities and another term of five months for the approval of these proposals.
As, in the first place, there are some measures that are in course and that there #be continue and promote, like the adhesion of the European Community to *Eurocontrol, process that will allow no only incorporate a greater political responsibility by part of the European Union but, besides, that set up the last convention and, therefore, that #can adopt  measures in function of majority votes, by majorities, and not having to resort systematically to the unanimities.
As they know, the Council of the past Monday, two days ago, has condemned the disproportionate use and *indiscriminado of the strength in *Chechenia, that has caused great sufferings to the civil population and has forced alas to #a lot of *decenas of thousands of persons to displace  to other zones of the country.
In this sense, the #finnish Presidency has made an extraordinary work, that will reflect  in a report to the European Council of *Helsinki on the no military instruments for the management of #crisis.
I expect that we #can have the continuous support of the Parliament to the hour to develop procedures more flexible and faster and, as I am safe that the High Representative will be had to recognise, do not lose any opportunity to pose this same question to the Council.
Like this, the permanent research of effects in the short term in detriment of the long term, the need of glorification personal of a #french president, a zero, #all these discussions and other protocols of *Nuremberg #can damage the subtle relations of geopolitical strength that existed from takes *lustros among States Joined, *Francia, Big *Bretaña and *Alemania.
In this line, had the opportunity of *preguntarle in his appearance in front of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence #which #would be the political means -and thought, fundamentally, in the Conference *Intergubernamental- to take advantage of the next Conference *Intergubernamental in benefit of the *PESC.
Gentleman President, the backrest of the greater part of my Group to the construction of the #european identity of defence has a lot that see, although no #everything, with the lesson learnt in the war of *Kosovo and the idea that, in #some cases, alas, is necessary an intervention armed in front of the massive rapes of human rights.
In the field of the services -the market with a greater potential of expansion, especially for the #european providers-, is precise to improve the access to the markets with the inclusion of new fields, #if well it is indispensable that consult  explicitly to the European Parliament in this look.
Gentleman President, have presented a question of order relative to the Report *Haug, because the original version is #german and, by misfortune, do not talk #german and the #english version said *algo entirely distinct of the #portuguese version regarding the amendment *nº 31.
Without embargo, the services *me have informed -and confirm this information- that the original text, the #german version is the authentic and, therefore, the versions in the other tongues will adapt  to the #german version, with the consequences that *usted has aimed.
The politics of the European Parliament with regard to *Chechenia sees  *importunada by the fact that, by his part, the western countries have acted of a mood that *les has taken to lose the moral authority to condemn *contundentemente the errors that *Rusia commits at present in *Chechenia.
All #this, while the call "*virtuosa" international community justifies the #russian intervention with the excuse of the fight against the terrorism and the International Monetary Bottom subsidises in depth lost the power of *Yeltsin, in spite of the *millardos of dollars diverted by the #russian authorities.
Like this, in the year 1994, the #russian army took part to show that *Rusia controlled the operative oil pipelines that allowed to export the production of the sea *Caspio, not to run the risk to remain excluded of the big #american game.
By #this ask a political dialogue, demand a political solution and plead also by the application of the means of pressure to our scope, which means also the freezing of new projects in the frame of *TACIS or the denial of the alimentary help to *Rusia.
I support the idea that we attend to *Moscú in December with occasion of the elections, as I already have exposed, and that *presionemos to *Moscú and to #all the *Cáucaso to take part in a conference for the peace, in the that resolved , in addition to this partial problem, also the other problems, since in the *Cáucaso carry out bellicose actions in half dozen of countries and the threat of extension of #the same is quite evident.
The representative of the Council has said this morning that the agreement of *Berlín is the point of game in these negotiations, but has said, to his time, that the agriculture #can constitute a grave problem, and believe that *Europa has to be more offensive in this subject.
It did not want to *yo that the century *XXI was also marked by a crisis of the humanism because the trade, the money, #would prevail on the development of the man, on the fundamental values that constitute the life of the man.
The desirable entry of Chinese, in favour of the *cual also the European Union is negotiating actively, will convert definitely to the World-wide Organisation of the Trade in more representative and will expand his potential capacity to consolidate a free global trade but, to #the same time, regulated.
#One of the fields, on the that *yo will not say at all, since in the distribution of competitions among the two speakers has assumed it the colleague and fellow Mr. *Leinen, is the method and the procedure; the depth, #if they want to, the scope of the reform of the institutions.
And the signatories of the Treaty like this recognised it, since they incorporated a protocol, the Protocol on the institutions in the perspective of the enlargement of the European Union, precisely to see how #would have to resolve these questions in the future.
To the contrary that the Round of the #Millenium, still have not achieved that the public opinion, the no governmental organisations and the colleagues #be  by this subject that is distant still a lot to occupy the thoughts of #all.
The European Parliament #can not - as often it takes the Commission - have the Governments like only speakers and, therefore, has to treat to open and to pose a perspective of character, by like this say it, constitutional so that the instruments for an effective democracy are clear for #all and no only for #few specialists.
Gentleman President, in our relative debate to the mandate of the next *CIG, wanted to say in the first place some words on a question that did not appears in the agenda of this conference, but of the that will get a day in that our Assembly will owe -*me seems to me- occupy and evaluate the results of #all the operation.
We have to work in a reform of these cooperations reinforced that it allow the establishment of an authentic avant-garde of the Union, opened inside the Union, to end to follow progressing by the road of the security, the democracy and the stability of our continent.

. (*SV) Basing in the strategy of the European Union for the period 1995 - 1999, in December of 1988 the Council of *Europa urged to the institutions to develop a strategy integrated and balanced against the drug for the back period to 1999, taking in consideration the new possibilities that awards the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
It did not considers the Council that the utilisation of the bottoms of the European Union by part of the *PNUCD for programs applied in accordance with diets that do not respect the human rights minima supposes a grave *incumplimiento of the principle of *condicionalidad that inspires the action of the European Union?
Gentleman President in exercise, *me pleases *oírle say that the nuclear energy is safe, because it do not fits to expect, in financial or economic terms, that countries that at present produce among the 30 and 40% of his energy in nuclear head offices the substitute by renewable energies or by means of the combustion of fuels fossils without causing terrible additional damages to the environment in said countries, that already present high indexes of pollution.

In consequence, with arrangement to the *Eurodac, all Been member is forced to collect the impressions *dactilares of #all the applicants of asylum, of #all the that they are arrested persons when crossing the borders, with the end to check #if they already have presented an appeal of asylum in another State.

Wail that have not taken advantage of  this opportunity to look for a greater consensus on this frankly important subject, since it is necessary that #can take the necessary measures against those who cross the borders of the European Union with criminal intentions.
The safest solution #would be to detain the operation of these plants during the change of #millenium, but is not easy that a country like *Lituania #can detain the operation of the plant of *Ignalia, that provides the 75 percent of his capacity of generation.

In this sense are very significant the following words pronounced by #one of the negotiators of the delegation of *Rambouillet: "they Ask to a #albanian politician by a date *anodina, by an insignificant event of the history and *le will inform with #all luxury of details.
In the context of the previous debate on the suppression of the pity of death, believe that really it proceeds that we demand of the #russian authorities that respect our opinion, that is the opinion of *Europa, about #if the Mr. *Nikitin has to be object of an indictment and how sanction  *le has to impose.

The agriculturalists contribute a lot to this cultural identity of a region of a country, as it that cultivates , or was, the autochthonous production, has marked during generations no only the kitchen, but also the habits and the philosophy of the life of this population.
The traditional kitchen, that has developed  from the products of crop regional -the *cuales of course had to  adapt to the climate- no only constitutes, without embargo, a pleasure for the palate of the autochthonous population, but also for those who watch further of his own *calderos.
Like result, diminished visibly the production of tomatoes, which determined to his time a reduction of 83.468 tonnes in the #portuguese quota of tomato concentrated in the distribution of the quotas for the campaign 1999/2000 and the corresponding increase of the quotas of other three States members.

To5-0025/1999 of the Mr. *Gallagher, in name of the Commission of Fishing, on the proposal of regulation of the Council (*COM(1999)141 - *C4-0224/1999 - 1999/0081(*CNS)) by the that it modifies  by third time the Regulation (*CE) *nº 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of resources *pesqueros through technical measures of protection of the juvenile of marine organisms.

. (*FR) *Nosotros Will not vote positively the resolution of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, since, in spite of the subtle formulation, the pretended worries on the human rights do not reach to dissemble the purely mercantile interests.
The sense of our rejection to approve the resolution is to protest at the same time against the conditions of the workers of this country, against the tightness of the village *kurdo and against the no respect of the elementary freedoms by the #turkish State.
#That is the reason by the that plead, gentleman President, by an authentic work of critical evaluation of the past experience, followed of an offensive paper of the Union in *pro of an organisation democratised, opened to the civil societies, really universal and that surpass *resueltamente the hiatus among commercial worries and requirements of development *solidario and durable.
It #would be a misfortune for the consumers of the #european countries, in particular for the less favoured consumers that #would experience the frustration of not being able to choose among the numerous pertinent products of #everyone to prices lower that the that they #can find  in the national markets.
*Nosotros Are safe that the popular reactions all over the world have been a factor determinant in the failure of the conversations. No only because the demonstrators frustrated the official ceremony of the inauguration, but also because they created a climate #such, that not even those who believe to control the planet, #can ignore it.
The report that has presented  no only *nos goes to serve of base for the next works of the approval of the management for 1998, but also *nos will serve like important document for the reform of the structures of the administration and will be used of constructive way to make the necessary improvements.
I am convinced that it treats  of an opportunity for the #european youth and that it constitutes a proof that *Europa #can not be only the *Europa of the figures and of the economy, but that precisely the training and the culture have to be the stones of touch so that *nos comprise, so that regions that are so different in his cultures complement  and are *tolerantes in it that *atañe to the differences.
Of compliance with the section 5 of the article 7 of our Regulation, #all deputy occupies his seat in the Parliament and in his organs with *plenitud of rights although it have not verified  his *credencial or have not resolved  on a possible impugnation.
. (*FI) Lady Speaker, ladies and gentlemen deputies to the European Parliament, want to appreciate, first, this occasion to talk with the European Parliament on the most important events occurred under the #finnish Presidency, a time already *clausurado the European Council of *Helsinki.
Because it is true that in the enlargement has manifested  an open and political criterion expanding to #all the countries the possibility to be able to integrate, to be able to *concurrir in a spirit of emulation and to be able to take part in our adventure.
After the Summit of *Helsinki, the Bosses of State Greater of the Defence of different countries will integrate the Military Committee of the EU, on the that there #be not any type of control democratic.
We are in the path of a federation of States to a federal State and #this only is still the penultimate treaty before the Constitution of a federal State, as nobody wants to renounce to the right to veto in matter of modifications of the treaty, collection of new taxes and sending of soldiers to the war.
I have to say that the Commission do not remains at all out of the decision of the Conference *Intergubernamental and have to say likewise that the paper of the Parliament has increased with regard to *Amsterdam, although with a lower progress with regard to it that so much the Commission like the President of the Parliament exposed in the debate of *Helsinki.
The decisions of *Helsinki *evidencian that, after the appearance of the democracy, after the hollow speeches on the human rights, hides  the fascism of the imperialist interests, hides  the violence against the villages that resist  to the new order.
As I create to have understood, also it has offered a solution for the last point of discrepancy among the Council and the European Parliament in the context of the general procedure, specifically, that reduce  in 2.000 millions of euros the credits of payment.
It has been a historical year in #a lot of senses, as the Commission #would prefer -am sure- forget #some of the most dramatic moments of the past spring, as also #some of *nosotros #would prefer to forget #some of the most spectacular results of the elections of the summer!
Gentleman President, estimated and estimated colleagues, in my quality of speaker of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, have to say that the budget that now presents  is a social budget, as in this case, a time incorporated our rectifications, has clearly in account the measures in matter of politics of employment.
Subject: *Machismo administrative Taking into account that the problem of the *subrepresentación and exclusion of the women of the #alto put do not resolves  with the presence of men very intentional, how measured will propose the Commission to change the current situation, in the that the 90 % of the #alto put are not women?
In effect, in front of the fault of agreements of the industries *cerveceras, the operators with great quotas of market will leave to make investments in the bars in the that commercialise his products, to happen to allocate said bottoms to great advertising campaigns allocated to strengthen his position in the market.
I consider that a transparency of prices every time greater and the introduction of the euro are inducing increasingly to the consumers of the markets of prices high to purchase his vehicles in other States members.
Although it is possible that the helps in question are compatible with the #german systems and the Treaties, the Commission feels a strong worry by the distortion that #the same cause by the concentration of an increasing quantity of capacities in this specific industrial sector.
I have summoned a special meeting of the Commission of Budgets for morning to the 9.15 of the morning or to the hour in that it finish the vote, and then will vote the Report *Colom and, #if it is necessary, will vote the changes of the report of the Mr. *Bourlanges.
But although we negotiated while it bombed  *Kosovo, the Council denied  to adapt the category 4 to *algo so obvious like the fact that, to the cape of some months, the Union #would see  involved in his reconstruction, #would have to contribute humanitarian help and, surely, #would have to compensate also to *Rumania and other countries by the losses suffered in the trade of the *Danubio.
It goes  to conclude an additional agreement motivated only by the specific interests of a country of the another side of the Atlantic, which #can contribute to delay the process of definition of some common norms, since said Agreement demands, for example, the unanimity.
Without embargo, *yo *le pray that *nos say clearly of how mood #can take part the Parliament in the processes of decision, how #can guarantee  that we #can take part to time, how #can guarantee  the permanent transmission of the information -for example, by means of permanent speakers or of small groups of experts-, how #can fulfil  the goal of the conjoint control of the Agreement of 1958 by part of the Commission and of the Parliament.
Gentleman President, #if we want to guarantee #all the social benefits that has the pure air for the humans and the environment, will have to fulfil rigorously the norms established by the recent managerial of the EU on the broadcasts of the vehicles and the quality of the fuel.
*Portugal Was the *primer #european empire and goes to be the last #european empire and #can say that it closes the cycle with "key of gold", in the measure in that, on the one hand, takes the peaceful and amicable transmission of the territory of *Macao to the Popular Chinese and, by #another, *Timor gets of happy form to his independence.
I expect that the Council and the Commission *nos guarantee that they will not throw  backwards to the hour to express the indignation of *Europa in front of the continuous attacks to the human rights and to the human freedoms, it that for *nosotros supposes an important challenge in the next century.
They include  the nine indicators proposed for the next evaluation of the plan of action of *Pekín and mention  the commitments of the States members to reach an egalitarian participation of men and women in #all the levels to be able to and decision, in compliance with the plan of action of *Pekín.
It wanted to likewise that it took into account the fact that also the attitude of the States depending of the sensitivity of each #one and, therefore, of his culture, has shown that what more literate is a village, less external wars, less civil wars, less injustices there #be in the regions in the *cuales the culture has given steps forward.
Certainly, it #would have been preferable that the group of the groups of left had treated to express  of common agreement, inside the respect of his plurality, and am convinced that it was possible to join, around these questions, to a #european plural left, #whose voice *Europa needs.
Today the Council asks #one *flexibilización to the Commission, with the pretext that, in some cases, the industries #can not avert an accidental minimum pollution of his products by matters modified genetically, during the transport or the process of transformation.
These words appear in the following questions: it meant the fall of the wall that the market assumed the power and that like result of *ello in *Beijing accept seriously the word "*mainstreaming" , that the men have withdrawn  -#if no a bit to the bottom- a bit at the side and that with *ello have yielded *algo to be able to and now want to experience *algo of the *sarampión?
The internal group of the European Parliament on reproductive health has called the attention in repeated occasions on the existent relation among the fight against the poverty, the *equiparación of the woman and the reproductive health.
Gentleman President, the project *Gardaland, approved in December of 1997 by the Council of Governors of the European Bank of Investments, is a subject that already has arisen in the Parliament previously, in the turn of questions oral to the Commission.
Gentleman President, as it already has indicated the Council in his answer, the European Bank of Investments is a bank and, therefore, #can not work @atener to #the same rule of publication of documents that the legislative organs of the European Union.
Subject: Coincidence of the sessions *plenarias of the *PE with the meetings of the Council of Ministers Of the 41 meetings of the Council of Ministers programmed among the months of September and December of 1999, 18 coincide with dates in the that the European Parliament celebrates his partial periods of sessions in *Estrasburgo or *Bruselas.
Subject: Advertising of the activity of the Court of Justice of the European Communities The recent events become in the European Union have shown the need that the process of taking of decisions of the Union was transparent.
Without embargo, the secret of the deliberations stipulated in the Treaties has the argument that it is a half effective of *salvaguardar the independence of the judges, the approval of the sentences and also the conjoint interpretation of the community Right.
Gentleman President, consider that the Council has answered already to the question of the mentioned journalist, and want to call the attention on the fact that the Council modified his posture in relation with the publication of the documents of #such form that so alone a document was not facilitated.
Have also that have clear that #can not admit of any way the illegitimate practices of free finance that follow #some companies -included the public sector, that is the worst delinquent that there #be in the European Union-, and condemn to death, to the inaction, to the business castration, to thousands of companies, as I already have mentioned.
We are had to award an extension of eight months so that the States members #can recover the #stray time, but on 1 September of the year 2000 the compulsory system has to introduce definitively in #all the States members and for #all the dealers of meat of bovine.
As already it has signalled , the Commission, to avert a legal gap, #would see  forced to present a third proposal, that #would be based in the article 19 of the valid Regulation (*CE) *nº 820/97 and *prorrogaría the valid disposals on the voluntary labeling.
The truth is that today we forbid the meat of bovine #american, because it contains these hormones, but also know that, #if we allowed to the Americans sell this meat of bovine in our market, to an interesting price for our consumers, and #if we indicated in a label that contained these hormones, #would follow *comprándola.
At present, and *usted *me said it even takes a moment, #everything is for building, even for reconstructing, from the point of sight logistical and of the training, in the sectors of the health, of the justice, of the public services.
#This is it that occurs with a rigorous budgetary discipline dictated to the States members, whereas the Union do not imposes  to himself/hisself same #the same rigour; in effect, this budget 2000 will cost very expensive to the States, since the agricultural line, once again, pays the heaves of the external actions.
The proposal of directive by the that establish  measured of fight against the *morosidad of the commercial transactions constitutes, in this sense, a good instrument to finish with the excessive and many times abusive terms of payment that apply  to determined basic sectors and that they are the main cause of failure and of the financial difficulties and of investment to the that they have to face up the #SME.
We expect that the voice of the Parliament was listened by the Council and that finally #can establish some rules of game contractual harmonised in the #european field thanks to the *cuales finish with the *morosidad and the dominant positions of #some creditors in matter of terms of payment and improve like this the competitiveness of the #SME.
*Nosotros Thought that it was not neither much less the suitable moment, to the sight that the question *kurda is very far of *acercarse to a solution regarding the right of self-determination of the village *kurdo and that is not  finishing at all with the rapes of the human rights.
The #european dimension of the cultural programs that deserve economic support finds  beyond all doubt contained in the book in #all his potentiality, and to the Union no *le supposes any extra cost, only to the consumer. *Permítanme That call to the dear "consumer reader" .
By means of this procedure, that supported  in the respect of the #european norms of competition, the Commission pretended, in reality, put in cloth of trial the system of the only price of the book, that allows especially support the literary creation and guarantee the survival of the small publishers and bookshops.
The States members of the European Union and the European Commission have accredited his attitude in favour of the international penal justice collaborating closely with the courts for the crimes of war in *Ruanda and in the ancient *Yugoslavia and *apoyándolos amply.
#The same *rebasa the 0,7 *millardos of euros and the compensations to the particular will reach the sum of 0,5 *millardos of euros. The damages in the public command encipher  in more of a *millardo of frank, since they have produced  #a lot of *estragos in the roads and in the roads *férreas, in the electrical and #telephone lines, in the buildings and public facilities.
*Me Seems just to signal that, taking into account the time of the that had, the commission and the Parliament have worked of the more effective and fast way possible in it that resulted to be difficult circumstances, so that the money #can be allocated to this so important Bottom the next year.
Therefore, it wanted to that so much the Commission like the Council *repensasen the subject and that the next proposal that subject  to this Parliament establish the forcing of the application in #all the States members, with an only juridical foundation in the statistical subject.
It is totally incoherent to postpone a year the application of the compulsory labeling of the meat of *vacuno and condemn to #the same time the application by part of *Francia of the principle of caution, in base precisely to the fault of a compulsory labeling.
It has produced  an agreement of peace among the different parts, that has applied  and respected as a whole, although the security in this country follow being little stable by the presence of gentlemen of the war and by a strong advance of the fundamentalism *wahhabita present in *Afganistán.
Only in the last months has got  to a true *tranquilización of the situation, after having suspended the hostilities the parts confronted in the civil war and have decided to constitute *próximamente a government of coalition.
Second, *me surprises the fact that *usted *desconozca the existence of a back resolution that forbids finally the participation of the party *ADEP in the elections and that, therefore, deprives to twenty millions of *kurdos of the right to express his political will in the elections.
Gentleman deputy, the Council takes use of #all his political and diplomatic possibilities to show clearly to the #turkish Government it that they are the #european standards of human rights and that expects of *Turquía the respect of said rights in #all the individual cases and in #all the situations.
It is necessary to consider always to *Gibraltar under two juridical systems different as it knows  that the current borders of *Gibraltar do not correspond to his historical borders, is to say, there #be a part of *Gibraltar that definitely is part of Big *Bretaña and there #be another part, the situated north that, #if like this it wants , is #spanish territory under #british administration.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0158/99) of the Mr. *Herman, in name of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, on the improvement of the operation of the institutions without modifying the Treaties.
Like east is the last report of the colleague *Herman, want *expresarle my congratulations in name of the Group of the European Socialists of this Assembly by the work of twenty years, especially, by his dedication and commitment and by #everything it that has contributed to that it advance the institutional sector.
But yes it is necessary to say that it is a work that has faced up to a problem: the grave problem to the that confronts  the Commission in front of the *desfase existent among his competitions, the tasks, the management of programs that  *le entrust, by a part, and the means that it has, by #another.
It wanted to say to #all my colleagues how much *me have thrilled his samples of esteem and his assessment of my report and *me *apresuro to add that #this is the result of a collective work, that is not the reflection exclusively of my worries.
But also there are sectors in the that the reforms have already hit: the administrative reform, is to say, the reduction of the number of *voivodías, the sanitary reform, the introduction of boxes of illness or the reform of the pensions.
A community expanded without before have proceeded to the necessary reforms will suffer a greater and permanent vulnerability concerning the disagreements that #can prevent the progress to our last goal, that is the training of the States Joined of *Europa.
The transformations that have taken place in these countries to incorporate  to the economy of market *nos have provided new markets and places of work, and this greater stability *les has helped to *sobrellevar better the #russian crisis, with it that *nos have rid to take part with programs of help.
The Commission proposes to introduce from now on an only general diet of exemption by category for #all the categories of agreements, in it that refers  so much to the resale of commodities as to the services, the sakes of intermediaries and the rights of property industrial.
The #SME of #all the sectors will be able to take out benefit of the deregulation that derives  of the reform of the politics, and the application of the thresholds of the parts of the market will avert that the dominant companies #can close the market.
To fulfil #all these goals that have enumerated is necessary that the office of the Defender of the European Village give reply to our citizens effectively and, thus, in the report congratulate to the Mr. *Söderman by the worry shown in that his secretariat work of suitable way.
It expected also have the occasion to appreciate personally to the President #Gil-Oaks his continuous support of my work of mediator concerning the boys kidnapped, and to give graces also to the Mr. *Söderman by his excellent work like Defender of the European Village.
It is not a trial to talk of the custody of the boys, is a legislative instrument that demands that the boys return to the country in the that reside usually, to argue the case and adopt a decision on his custody.
I believe that the most significant function that has exerted, and that follows exerting, the institution of the Defender of the Village resides, without place to doubts, in his efforts for reaching a greater transparency in the group of the EU, look #this that constitutes a look of big importance.
Lady Speaker, am totally in accordance with the Mr. *Söderman in that #if the EU had had a culture of transparency in the management #where the citizens #can examine the subjects of the civil servants, *cuando are finished, #can have  averted #a lot of cases of fraud and numerous irregularities.
Gentleman President, wish to appreciate to the speaker, Mrs. *Peijs, his contribution and his support to this proposal of the Commission that modifies the program «Customs 2000». The scope and the importance of the proposal have been explained very clearly by the lady speaker, #as well as by the Gentlemen

Second, I expect that this document was to disposal of the new Parliament and of the Commission in functions and his new President designated, the Mr. *Prodi, so that the deputies to the new Parliament have the information that need to end to watch by that the nomination of Commissioners take  of effective form.

Graces, gentleman President, with #all respect, *Sir *Brittan, have to celebrate now the discussion and #if *usted says that there #be not any reason for the panic as have already the prohibition, then have to say that we have been very near to renounce to this prohibition and treats  here surely, as it says the Mrs. *Mann, of the question of the *way *of *life in *América and in *Europa.
*Sir *Brittan, in this point it is necessary to consider *prioritaria the protection of the consumer and #this is not a juridical question, but that the juridical question has to subordinate to the protection of the consumer and to the prevention in favour of our citizens.
It That *me irritates also to a large extent is that precisely those States members that have the full mouth of the word subsidiariness have put the greater hit to allow  it to the States members that say: it listens, it is not the only half but do not leaves to be a half that we want to apply for the creation of more employment.

I entrust in that the States members cost  of this subsidiariness that *les concede, without *escudarse -as it fears the Mr. Go *Velzen- in the comfortable situation to have an obstacle posed by the European Union not to see  exposed to the weight of the decisions taken under his responsibility.
We #can not *quedarnos blind in front of the paper and the responsibility that has to assume the European Union to contribute to put end to the #european drama of *Kosovo, #where are ignoring  the most elementary values. Elementary values, human values with the that *nos enjoys *identificarnos.
I create, gentleman President proposed, that *usted has tackled #a lot of important points, without embargo, in name of National Alliance, *me allow to remember that perhaps it is precise loan greater attention to the politics of the Mediterranean, especially because *usted same has estimated timely to affirm that #this *Europa, projected to the East, is obviously #one *Europa that it #can - *sobrentiende- have left to be it sufficiently attentive to the grave problems of our Mediterranean.
We are against of any reduction of the political paper of the Commission and consider the political balance among the Commission, the Parliament and the Council the fundamental axis of the #european democracy.
With #this step to my following observation: to measure that go rooting the Inner Market and the *UEM, is indispensable that the poor regions of the Union achieve the regional bottoms, social, agricultural, of fishing and of appropriate cohesion for *garantizarles the possibility to compete in equality of conditions with #all the other States members of the Union.
#If in the context of this fundamental subject of the values, of this debate, presents  #one *Europa like the that claimed in an occasion *Václav *Havel in front of this Assembly, also will be able to go back to obtain the approval of our citizens, that do not wish only #one *Europa of the markets.
It considers the current institutional frame in that it assent  the Commission -the principle of parity, of equality of the States members- like principle *estructurador and historical of the Union or adheres  to the most recent motivations that incite to a hasty and urgent review?
The interrogations of *les displaced made by representatives of the mission of verification of the *OSCE and by the Nations Joined, and also national interrogations, like the made by the federal Army German in the camps of refugees, reveal a picture *pavoroso of massive shootings, rapes, *saqueos and systematic destruction of the houses and properties of the *albanokosovares.
Taking *preparativos for the rehabilitation and the reconstruction after it have reached  a political and diplomatic situation, that #would comport also the participation of the EU in a temporary administration of *Kosovo, in wait of the final determination of his statute.
Gentleman President, by the friendship that *me joins to the Mr. #Spencer, will say that the intervention of the Mr. *Fischer confirms that our Parliament has gone back  shier that the Council in his proposals of reform of the External Politics and of Common Security.
By these reasons, and also because we have to follow improving our relations with *Rusia in the frame of the grave crisis of *Kosovo, support the decision adopted on 26 April by the Council, when approving a proposal of strategy common relative to *Rusia.
*Permítaseme Say in this moment that the fundamental conclusion of the report of the Mr. #Spencer on *Rusia, to know, that have to postpone the agreement on a common strategy until after the Summit of Colony of June is -and believe that #many suit in *ello here- a diplomatic madness.
#If the Liberal Group had not pleaded by a fast treatment in the Commission of Subjects Juridical, had not had a report on 3 December.
#Such as it signalled it yesterday the president of the Commission of Budgets, in the Commission of Budgets there #be a problem with the calendar: how guarantee that both branches of the budgetary authority #can occupy correctly of the letter *rectificativa.
Also it #would have to  expand the list of the exceptions of the right of retractation, especially regarding the credits *hipotecarios and to the agreements, that have effected  with a wide notarial advice, like the that it already has mentioned the Mrs. speaker.
In conclusion, also *me cheer that the Treaty of *Amsterdam have gone in in vigour three days ago and that the European Commission have of powers wider to take fulfil the legislation in the field of the consumers taking special upsetting in the protection of the human health.
*Me Seems well that it suppress  the right of reflection *cuando there #be a sufficient information, and *me seems timely the allusion to the principle of honesty in the transactions, that *yo #would relate with the more *señero, older, of the fine faith in the civil Right.
A second point: the States members follow thinking that it is inadmissible to subject really the agricultural politics to a parliamentary decision, especially in the budgetary section and in the modification of the Treaty our right of query is still very little developed.
Gentleman President, going back on #the same relative question to the possible utilisation of uranium impoverished in Serbian and *Kosovo, directed  a specific question so that it was included in the Turn of questions, a specific question, no a general question, as on the that treated yesterday the President in exercise of the Council.
*Yo Have to recognise that  *me had forgotten completely that it went  to celebrate this solemn session, and therefore it that am moving, to personal title, to the Assembly has not happened by any political sieve, and *le #can say that the evaluation that *yo #can take in these moments is that it #would go back to *votarles, so much to *usted as to the Mr. *Hänsch.
Yesterday, in the debate that celebrate, neither #can put brake to the multiple crimes of war, crimes against the humanity, and this Parliament transformed , with the resolutions, with the debate, with the interventions of the Council and of the Commission, in a washing machine of these crimes!
The Treaty of *Amsterdam has gone in in vigour only takes #one #few days and have to accumulate still experiences with *él as already now, in the wide debate on the future development and configuration of the European Union, sees  every time with greater clarity that beside the European Parliament have to include  also to the national Parliaments and a spectrum it wider possible of social groups.
It is true that the European Union will have to exert a very important paper in this sense, and *ello already from the stage of reconstruction, in the that the Commission - beside the World-wide Bank - will have a function of coordination.
Why each country of the *G7 has to present his own plan of reduction?Why we leave to our partners - and mainly #american - organise by *nosotros the external representation of the Community in the field of the euro, without giving *salia to the decision of the European Council of *Viena?
The principle of the *colegialidad of the political decisions *me seems indispensable, today the same that yesterday, for the own legitimacy of the Commission and of the institutional system European, without that *ello have to without embargo conduct to a fault of responsibility individual in #some situations in the that the decisions are not - and #can not - be collegiate.
The ambition manifested by the Mr. *Prodi regarding the political authority that wishes to exert with his colleagues and the European Parliament is an excellent *augurio and take votes so that this European convinced succeed, appreciating also to the Mr. *Santer it that has taken in the course of his mandate.
In this moment, by it that *me seems to perceive, the citizens of the States of the Union are concerned by the war, the misfortune, the social exclusion, the unemployment, the traffic of drug and the delinquency in general.
It is that there #be not in *Yugoslavia or in Serbian a million of innocent, a million of just, that allow to stop the stage of the bombardments, of the shatter of infrastructures generalised and the collateral damages and happen to a political solution after the punishment that received, no only the diet of *Milosevic, but the population in general?
I go to give a small example to the *respecto: *cuando the week happened the Council urged to the Commission so that it presented a proposal for the start of negotiations of association with *Albania and *Macedonia, *nos advance among 10 and 20 years, as under some normal circumstances #this #would be *algo on it that #would have thought  at least in ten years.
In it that to the financial prevention refers , already have indicated that *nos remain underneath of the upper limit of the own resources, is to say, that have a very considerable *margen of financial performance of the 0, 14 % of the gross social product of the Union for unforeseen costs.
With the postponement of the reform in the dairy sector until finals of the period 2000-2006, only have displaced  the costs of the reform to the following period of finance but do not surpass  the disequilibriums of the market.
The President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, #can have taken -assuming like this an influential paper and balanced, and in consequence, decisive for the future work of the Commission- a call to the parts so that, in name of the «#european soul», cease immediately the ethnic massacres and the bombardments.
Of here that it result necessary to establish a new system of wages and repayments in the that the repayment of the costs go accompanied of the presentation of the bill and the payment remain conditioned to the signature by the deputy of a statement in the that appear that the costs have made  in the exert of his mandate.
Lady Speaker, the World-wide Organisation of the Trade has fixed for 13 May next the date *tope so that the Europeans raise the embargo that *ellos have imposed to the imports of meat #american treated like hormones and mainly the *STB.
Besides, the speaker refuses the direct subventions to *través of the budget of the EU for the equipment and the exploitation of a supermarket and of the services of catering of the buildings of the Parliament.
In front of a so poor result for the insular cause, is *innegable that remains #everything for taking in the perspective of an effective consideration, and no only theoretical, of the specificity of the insular regions of the Union.
For the economic and social cohesion and, in consequence, for the core of the social model European, is of existential importance that have reached  conclude to time the new regulation before finalising the electoral period to the European Parliament.
Said of another mood, this Parliament, that represents to #european citizens, has pronounced  by our agricultural model European, by a greater equity, by a rural development balanced, by a greater quality, by the protection of the environment, as it gave off of the report *Cunha.
Like this as, *permítame, gentleman President, *plantearme a question: in this context, #which is the future of the rural world with the development of the Structural Bottoms for the urban world, with the new negotiations of the *OMC and with #one *PAC that goes against of the European Union?
Gentleman President, first of all, today have to be conscious of our responsibilities here in the last partial period of sessions of the Parliament, no only of our legislative function, but also of our commitment to provide this new round of #european bottoms to our regions and local communities punctually.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, like speaker for the *ISPA, the instrument of *preadhesión for the countries of enlargement and like person that has followed continuously the general reform of the structural Bottoms, am really happy that the Parliament conclude with hit this week the negotiations on the Diary 2000.
Anyway, today we get at the end of the agricultural reform contained in the Diary 2000 and *yo wanted to express my critical support to a reform that partially has gone losing his common #european approach and *desfigurándose before the pretences of east or that Been member.
Only that no #everything is perfect and a new advance of decisions of the Council *me concerns and *me seems inadmissible, mainly pretend introduce in the viticultural zone to new States members that have not been traditionally producers of wine: *Irlanda, *Dinamarca and *Suecia. This decision, to be applied, #would put in doubt our commitment regarding the bottom, the spirit by the that have got to an agreement.
In front of a situation of this type, had in principle two possibilities. A rigid and increasing control of the offer to take of #the same the central element of the Common Agricultural Politics or well adapt our politics of #such mood that #can attend new markets of additional sales.
In *Berlín have given also an important step to the sustainability of the agriculture as we have reached to include more acutely the environmental looks in the politics of market and in the politics for the development of the rural areas.
*Segunda: In opinion of the Commission, the shopping of intervention to some upper prices in the sector of the meat of *vacuno #would conduct to the training of new *excedentes no *vendibles and #would exert a considerable pressure on the budget #as well as on our prices of market.
The financial forecasts for the period 2000-2006 and the agreement *interinstitucional on the budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure constitute an essential part of the package of the Diary 2000.
Regarding the administrative cost, the agreement #would allow the finance of some 1.000 new places for the community institutions, and fund also the new Statute of the Deputies to the European Parliament, although it still do not discerns  a solution to this subject, as *ustedes know.
Nevertheless, of the article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen, deduces  only that the Council has to adopt relative concrete disposals to the integration of the secretariat of *Schengen in the General Secretariat of the Council, is to say, the functions of the secretariat of *Schengen and no necessarily his personnel.
By causes that come to the case, publications of press also in the day of today, want to indicate that the General Secretariat of the Council is not responsible of the tensions that at present exist in #the same but that the only cause of said tensions is a political decision of the Council that is protected by the Treaty.
Of course, childbirth of the fact that the Commission will use the so evident data of a report of the Court of Accounts to defend with the maximum energy the interests of the European Union.
In the 55ª meeting of the Commission of Rights Human celebrated of the 23-3 to the 30-4-1999 in Gin, the European Union presented a project of resolution by the that it demands  to the *Iraq that cooperate with the pertinent international organisations and that communicate the #whereabouts or destination of the persons that follow disappeared.
Having #this in account, #would be interesting to know #which are the plans of the Council to achieve a participation balanced of men and women in the future Commission, and how opinion *le deserves to the Council the idea to appoint to a member of the Commission that commission  exclusively of the equality of opportunities among men and women.
I believe that the subject of the right of the employees to call the attention on irregularities and to take criticise public is not an internal subject related with the determination of the charges #etcetera, but that it is a subject of principles, on transparency.
In general lines, are in favour of the reform, without embargo, have to express #some reservations with regard to the grey zones that present looks that have not deepened  still as, for example, the impact in the regions that, in virtue of the principle of concentration, will suffer a paralysis in his process of development.
*Me Ask #if *ustedes do not have a *tercer model, that *yo #would designate «agricultural model Austrian». Austrian, because in front of the North American #wagnerian productions, #would exist the agriculture of «operetta»: the agriculturalists #would protect the landscape, the nature, the environment, so that *Sisí #can give a walk the weekends.
To allow the operation of the inner market and the integration, #among others looks, of the free trade of the alimentary products like an element more of #the same, is fundamental that in the countries candidates respect  the norms that has established the EU in matter of hygiene and health.
The results in the regulation of the measures of intervention in the sector of the fishing #can be considered like satisfactory graces, precisely, to the attitude of the Commission of Fishing that, from the *primer moment,  *opuso to the initial design of the Commission.
The fact that we are planning to spend more money in the *Europa rural, to the that joins  the data that every time it is lower the number of persons related with the agriculture, guarantees a level of life minimum for the agriculturalists during the next seven years.
#If well my region has reached to keep inside the Goal 1, #this is not more that a Goal 1 of transitory character, since the amount of money that has received  with arrangement to this goal is #a lot of minor that the quantity *per *cápita that perceived  during the last program.
It #would wish also take state my gratitude to the salient Commission because, in the *fragor of the debates, nobody has stopped  to think in the members of the Commission that have developed an arduous work in favour of the #european citizens, these same citizens to the that represent.
As I already have said in reiterated occasions, the greater part of the projects of development rural #can not succeed without the fundamental business activity, the agricultural activity, since these projects do not advance by himself/hisself alone.
Had account that the consumption has descended *vertiginosamente and that the other countries have increased his confidence in the own production without resorting to the import, the collapse of the #russian economy has not taken more that weaken a market already of by himself/hisself fragile.
It is by this reason that in #some moments the European Parliament has felt the need of *radicalizar his position getting even to block the process of taking of decisions with regard to the finance of the Committees to *través of the community budget.
This guarantee *reviste a big importance, since it is the principle on the that will insist and, in case that it did not get  to an agreement on this question, #can *comunicarle to the Council that, one after the other, #all the procedures of *codecisión will get to the stage of conciliation and that, #one and another time, will pose  difficulties to this problem.
The most important of *ellos is the enlargement of the field of the regulation to other modalities of work atypical, like the employment of rent or the work to distance, that have increased *vertiginosamente in the last times.
The opinions of the Commissions of Subjects External and of Development and of Cooperation insist in the need to deepen and improve the conditions for his development, the same that the Commission *REX, that goes back to insist on *ello in a section of this report.
In the first place, gentleman President, is evident that #all the commissions involved of this Parliament, the Commission of Relations Economic External, the Commission of Development and Cooperation and the Commission of Subjects External, Security and Political of Defence, have asked it.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the Agreement of association economic, *concertación political and cooperation that today subjects  to ratification of this Parliament constitutes an essential stage in the ambitious route that initiate takes already four years to establish a new relation with *México to the height of our ambitions.
Already in the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the solutions offered with regard to the implantation of the Agreement of *Schengen, the institutional questions, the subdivision and the procedures were highly debatable and little clear. Not even they form part of the Treaty, but that they are object of a protocol.
#All share pretty much with #all our heart the goal to establish a politics of refugees human, without embargo, have the feeling of that the democracy «finds  better protected in the pockets of the citizens», using a #danish expression.
To avert that the #european citizens remain excluded of these new technologies of the information no only is indispensable that the training in new technologies give  from the first stages of the education, but that adopt  suitable measures in the field of the training along #all the life.
Gentleman President, when taking the word by last time in name of the Popular Party European giving answer to the Mr. *Barzanti, the one who has taken previously the word in name of the Socialist Group European, #can not by less to say, in an alone sentence, it that believe that we are #many in feeling, and is that *le go to throw a lot of less.
To the Mr. *Samland, that has used a no juridical argument but politician, *yo *le #would remember that this Assembly has asked many times to the Council that abandon the unanimities and the qualified majorities to go to adopt the agreements by majority.
The credits for commitments proposed for the structural actions are satisfied to the decision of the European Council; #this elevate  to 32, 678 *millardos of euros, delivered among the structural Bottoms (30 *millardos) and the Bottom of Cohesion (2, 6 *millardos of euros), it that represents an effective decrease of the 7 % regarding 1999, is to say: a lot, and, in some measure, too much.
How it #can say of the consistent budgetary initiative in fixing a goal of costs in place of a maximum limit of costs, in looking for at all costs projects to spend the credits approved in place to assign credits to the existent projects?
Besides, it #can surprise the fact that during the negotiations have sacrificed  the Goal 2, allocated to the industrial and rural regions in roads of economic restructuring, to the Goals 1 and 3: his endowment, for the period 1999-2006, will be of 22, 5 *millardos of *ecus, figure pretty much similar to the of the period 1994-1999.
The fact that the committees work in a frame of opening and of transparency means a progress, but *apartarlos of the national realities in the exercise of his function, for *situarlos under the authority of the Commission, constitutes a deviation that refuse.
So that it was accepted the result of the referendum on the autonomy for *Timor Oriental, foreseen for 8 August with the backrest of the Nations Joined, the plebiscite will have to celebrate in some conditions of justice and freedom that #can not  entrust in that it guarantee the #indonesian army.
This agreement is the culmination of fifteen years of diplomatic management and produces  *veintitrés years after the annexation by the strength of this ancient #portuguese colony in the that died hundreds of thousands of persons, victims of the civil war and of the brutal repression of the #indonesian army.
And I take votes so that #all the that they continue have the happiness to celebrate the next month of September a big victory of the village *timorense, by the expression of his free will to decide his own future in the referendum that will celebrate  the next day 8 August.
I expect that after *tantos years of suffering, reestablish  finally the legality, that finally the right of self-determination also was a fact and that the perspective of the referendum give a true opportunity to the democracy, in place to increase the violence, #such as *sucede in this moment in varied zones of Indonesian.
It exists a majority of 101 countries of the 190 that form the international community -and did not treats  of a theoretical majority, since the Treaties approved and the constitutional modifications carried out by numerous countries like this show it-, that are favourable to the establishment of a universal moratorium.
#If today *les explain #this is for *decirles that my eyes will not go back to dampen , but that this emotion *perdurará until we have reached this moratorium, until we have reached to abandon the roads of the past, the roads of the barbarism and advance by the path of the future and of the *humanización.
This weakness is not related only with *Ocalan, but with the *importantísima question of the human rights and of the citizens for #all the Turkish, and especially, for the big minority *kurda of *Turquía. It did not recognises  his identity, his tongue, his education, his political expression.
In this context, is to regret that any Been member of the European Union have ratified the Statute of said Court, especially #if we take into account that the Union has pretended to characterise for being a space no only of pluralism and of diversity, but, especially, for being a community of Right.
In concrete, from 1 January 2001 will dispense  to the small and medium enterprise to present five variables, although the States members will conserve the faculty to request the variable «conditions of delivery», «modality of transport» and «statistical diet» to the companies that surpass a true threshold.
To the contrary, believe that the Parliament #would have to be the that it advanced  for *esclarecer this relation of balance with the free society of the information without getting, nevertheless, to allow -as it has said the Mr. *Schulz- that Internet was a market for the commission of offences.
Lady Speaker, *me deserves #all the respect of the world that have turned off today the lights to sack  of a cordial way of #all the colleagues that have been present here the Fridays, and for the that today it will be the last day in this Assembly.
The proposal of the Mr. *Malangré bases  in the article 65 of the Treaty *CE, modified by the of *Amsterdam, and *yo the support; but, by a part, understand that it did not treats  only of a question *procedimental and, on the other hand, with the article 65 #would be in front of a case in the that it demands  the unanimity in the Council.
The organisation of the market of the starch of potato is closely related with the of the grain. With reason the producers of starch of potato operate, in big part, in #the same market that the industry of the starch of grain.
It That occurs is that these proposals are not  materialising and, #if they do not promote  really of an urgent form, #can disappear an important part of a very rooted sector in the #european industrial reality and that, especially, offers a big number of places of work.
#Some countries in roads of development that are members of the *OMC #would be in fact interested in reforming the agreement of the textile industry and of the preparation to accelerate the liberalisation of #all the quantitative restrictions that it will have to complete in date so next like 1 January of the year 2005.
It treats  to ask a positive action by part of the Commission to ensure that the practices of trade international in relation with the products derived of the textile industry have a suitable treatment.
Gentleman President, since #this is the last session of the term of office in the that *Finlandia has converted  in member of right plenary of the European Union, #would wish, as faithful *contertulio that I am of this group of the Fridays, that also the tongue *finesa took act of presence in the literal record of the last partial period of sessions.
Always it has been a joy *cuando at the end -*yo was often, although no always-, after a long and difficult work, closed  with a note of humour, and wish that this spirit that *usted always has had and that today also #many have manifested it in his interventions, was also the that it chair the next Assembly.
I have received of the Group of the Popular Party European the appeals of nominations of deputies of the following commissions: Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of the Citizens, the Mr. *Wieland; Commission of Regulation, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities, the Mr. *Gahler in replacement of the Mr. *Wieland.
Therefore, every time that there #be an election -*nos go well or *nos go badly individually- is a party, is a reason of joy, because have the security that at all it is upper to the popular will to the hour to choose to his representatives.
We know, because the know very well, that is *usted a demanding personality but also that has *usted a deep sense of the balance, thing that surely *nos will help in the future, to establish a fundamental point, a new style in the relations among the European Parliament and the Commission.
The conflict of *Kosovo has gone back to situate in the centre of our consciousness the point of game of the integration: the construction of an order of peace #european.
By #this, want to express our gratitude to our political friends of the Christian Democrat Union (*CDU) and the Christian Social Union (*CSU) and also to the Liberal by the firm support *solidario that have offered to the Presidency of the Council.
The #european Commissioner German designated *Verheugen manifested after the Summit of Colony that the fast agreement to strengthen the External Politics and of Common Security of the Union hardly #would have been possible without the war of *Kosovo.
It is impossible, therefore, form a trial on the Presidency that finishes to conclude without taking into account the low profile of his predecessor and the hopes conceived as a result of the birth of the euro that afterwards have finished in the at all and have remained on the paper.
By it that refers  to this last, the war of *Kosovo *nos remembers it founded of the criteria of *Copenhague, that take of the respect of the human rights and of the minorities a previous condition for #all the countries candidates to the adhesion to the European Union.
From my point of sight, a politics of defence of the Union will remain in a *atolladero regarding it essential while the Fifteen have not accepted the indivisible character of the security of the territory of the European Union.
The #finnish Presidency has requested an explanation to know #if the decision of Colony means that the EU only will be able to take part previous mandate of the UN or #if, #such as it has taken it the NATO, *ella also #can act of agreement to his own seem.
To measure that go happening the days, have increasingly the worrisome feeling of that the capacity to take the war surpasses with a lot the capacity to coordinate the reconstruction of the devastation that has suffered the life of the populations.
Some that aggravated by the crisis of confidence caused by the *descrédito of the Commission, exists a democratic deficit that affects to this Parliament, exists an abysmal distance among this Parliament and the daily problems of the #european populations.
Of course, #some have expressed -truth, gentleman *Cox?- Some weigh when seeing to ancient present Commissioners in his Commission, but *eso shows that maybe the Mr. *Cox, leaving carry by a wish of controversy, had not read well the ancient report of the experts, that precisely absolved very clearly to these Commissioners.
We go to back to his Commission and to those who doubt of his independence, gentleman President, alleging that has *demasiados socialist Commissioners *les will answer that, *cuando was designated *usted by a majority of Governments socialist and *socialdemócratas, the Group that felt  more surprised by his first public statements was precisely the Socialist Group.
It is on *nosotros and our collaboration that *reposará the possibility to go out of the current crisis that has been so deep that has reduced to minimum percentages in the political history European the number of #that that went to vote in the last elections.
I #can not but *extrañarme of the attempt of the group of rights of the Parliament of *prorrogar the nomination of the Commission demanding a report on the case, report that will be drafted by a group of experts neutral.
Apart from these considerations, our candidate to the Presidency of the Commission, the Roman Mr. *Prodi, has shown before the constructive and creative spirit with the that conceives the contribution of the Commission to the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
Lady Speaker, *Finlandia, with the big experience to having survived peacefully in difficult conditions, with difficult neighbours, is the ideal country to head our efforts, that today take  urgent, for the reconstruction of the *Balcanes, and, in fact, the president *Aatisaari has contributed already to the process decisively.
It Same #can say of the question of the code of behaviour for the high charges, because in the Commission, along the last years, the management definitely has relaxed  regarding internal organisation, #such as it underlined the report of the wise men.
Only it #can  *especular on until how point had engaged  the Mr. *Bangemann with some norms of game just in this look of the inner market *cuando is wishing to sell his knowledges to #Telephone, important operator in the European Union and further.
The Council highlighted especially the need to clear in brief the question of form deep and impartial, #as well as the possibility to reform the current legislation in case to be necessary.
The Council took #all the ordinary procedures on taking of decisions to guarantee a fast explanation of the proposals of the Commission, with seen to finish this work, always that it was possible, before finals of the present year, as it has proposed  the Council.
#That that at present take pressure to follow in the road of the total integration in the world-wide market with the purpose to satisfy the American demands have to give account of the so great responsibility that assume.
This week, the Commission has issued a formal statutory decision against the local organisers of the tournament of the Glass of the World of football celebrated the past year in *Francia.
Besides, it is important to add that the *imposición of a more elevated fine to the organisers of the Glass of the World of 1998 in *Francia #would have forced to the Commission to pose  undertake action against the organisers of previous important tournaments, that used exactly #the same politics of sale of entrances.
Already they have begun to observe the norms, establishing the precedent, and in #all the future occasions, #that will be the mood to manage the subjects in the European Union.
Lady Speaker, the second inform elaborated by the independent experts that  *nos finishes to remit is remarkable by the importance and the quality of the work made in so #few months and also by the will to describe with frankness the bad internal operation of the Commission.
We #can take #all the #european directives, #all the recommendations, #all the laws that want: #if the inspections do not guarantee his application, believe that the deep doubt of our *conciudadanos on the #european efficiency, #as well as on the interest of these norms, #can increase.
I have proposed a pair and #one of the delights to make a *primer speech in this Assembly is that #one has the feeling that these words go to be studied according to his merit and no simply judged by the background of the political party.
In the long process of gestation of the Commission of the #millenium, get to the decisive moment: his investiture, with the democratic legitimacy that *nos have given the recent #european elections to the European Parliament.
Like conclusion of the process, have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission in spite of the reservations that keep in relation with the Mrs. of Palace, #whose innocence boast, but #whose conception of the political responsibility in a subject that concerns to the community budget do not share.
The appearances of the Commission in the Parliament have not been at all an useless act or a vain representation, but absolutely essential and *usted same *nos has affirmed aptly the past week, that in any #another parliament the executive organ has to give explanation detailed #any.
But #if well no *le give neither a bounced cheque neither a cheque in white, *le communicate our will to work in common to give to #all the villages of *Europa, in spite of the difficulties and of the conflicts, reasons to believe in his own destination and entrust in his common future.
As, for example, a clean atmosphere and drinkable water, safe foods, that do not poison to the persons, or, for example, the protection of his economic interests workforces or also, for example, the definition of some basic norms in matter of health in the European Union.
Gentleman President, the right to give the approval to the Commission goes implicitly to the pair with the duty of the Parliament to verify the aptitude of the future commissioners to exert his mandate.
I go to begin with a general observation: #if the level of requirement applied to evaluate the qualification of the Commissioners went the that showed the colleague *Ingo #Friedrich in the audiences and that also has manifested in the debate of today, #any *nos #would pose difficulties.
#Both kept a debate of *primer order in the commission and offered an authentic demonstration no only of his technical qualification, but also -it that it is almost more important- of the new political culture to the that *usted same has referred , gentleman Commissioner, and of the dialogue among the European Parliament and the Commission.
It bear I satisfy, that the Mr. *Busquin have not shown the lower sensitivity, by not talking already of a commitment to defend the use of the Dutch in the #european institutions, supposes an insult for six millions of #flemish.
We want that these elements include  in our agreement on the operation among the Commission and the Parliament, because the number of abstentions or of votes against in the final vote of morning on the Commission will depend of the advances that produce  of here to morning in it that to these elements refers .
Without embargo, in the citizens, in the #european villages has remained an impression of fragility, by not saying of impotence; an impression of worrisome weakness precisely in front of a crucial question, in front of the question on the that arose *Europa: guarantee the peace in our continent.
*Usted Has signalled precisely like *primer goal the enlargement of the Union to the countries that are prepared and afterwards has staggered the forms of cooperation drawing concentric circles of virtual participation with the nearest countries but no prepared still for the entry.
And in the case *Dessault-*Augusta has remained among so much very clear that *él was to the common of the existence of a box *B. *Yo *me Ask: #who *nos guarantees that in the future there are not other boxes *B in the Commission, in the *DG *XII or where was, #if this subject do not resolves  of way more suitable that up to now?
The *presupuestación based in the activity, the cast restricted of assignments, the responsibility in the bureaucratic device, the effective control of the economic traffic #as well as the emphasis in the economic responsibility demand without embargo #a lot of work.
In my opinion in the so mentioned pertaining assignments to the Section 4 there #be without embargo an increase in comparison with the budget of the past year and on the other hand, under the Section 4, there #be besides some points in the that they have not made  cuts at all.
Regarding the orientation on the new agreements *interinstitucionales and other different instruments for the references so much of *Wynn as of *Bourlanges, warn that the Council thinks that it is possible the finance of a reservation for *Kosovo with a new orientation or trip of bottoms, but with security also the Council will respect the agreement *interinstitucional and #all his points.
Lady Speaker, the Mr. *Galeote took an intervention out of place because it did not treat  of a motion of censorship to my person but of the debate of investiture of the Mr. *Prodi, and criticised it that *yo had said of the Mrs. of Palace.
Of compliance with the agenda, the Presidency of the Council -hail to the Speaker in exercise, lady. *Halonen- And of the Commission proceed to take *sendas statements on the preparatory works of the meeting of the European Council the next days 15 and 16 October in *Tampere.
As it is natural, expect that in the field of the judicial cooperation remain guaranteed the juridical security of the citizens to the time that implants  a fast and effective system of police persecution *transfronterizo. It is to say, agile procedures, immediate exchange of documents, harmonisation of the penal Right and help for the victims.
On the other hand, we #can not lose of sight that the European Union has experienced an evolutionary process that has ended in the creation of a juridical order European and some #european institutions endowed of a series of competitions.
Other important questions are the politics of integration that affect also to the cultural rights of the minorities, the right to live in family with #all dignity and the political rights for #all the citizens that reside in *Europa.
The *JSA, authority *fiscalizadora, has directed hard criticisms against of the bad use given to the data, to the deficient information to the refugees on his rights and to that the same authority has not had access to the register of way suitable.
*Conque Leave to separate to the mothers of the children, to withdraw the permission of residence to a worker that has lost his employment and to violate the right of asylum.
It swims more far of the truth. Only we had the luck that thanks to the intervention of the NATO and to the return of the *albano-#Kosovar and his eagerness to initiate what before the reconstruction of his country, the flow of refugees dissolved  ahead of time.
The Council of Subjects General approved the day before yesterday the measures of the European Union directed to relieve the situation of the island and decided to forbid the export to #the same of arms, ammunitions and #all type of armament that #can be used in acts of terror and repression.
*Cuando Results that the Commission hardly is going out of the gravest crisis of his history and the European Union in group has reasons for *meditar on the signal of alarm without precedents that finish of *dirigirle millions of constituents and constituents, the moment loaned  so that they adopted  #some measures that #can open new perspectives, to measure that took *renacer the hope.
Thus, the Basque Country keeps a political conflict with the #spanish State that has given place to demonstrations of violent type, violence that refuse the majority of *nosotros, but that has seeded and left a trail of deaths, wounds, pain, extortion, fear and #a lot of innocent victims.
By #a lot of that the resolution approved have to consider like a list of commissions that entrusts  to the Commission *Prodi -that did not has our support- #can not *aprobarla, because in *ella the fundamental requests that formulates this Parliament to an administration in functions of the EU remain reflected for ever, as #if of eternal truths treated .
The Mr. *Prodi, so much by his fidelity to the principles that gave life to the current European Union as by his capacity of management tested, am safe that goes to conduct to the new Commission by the path and to the rhythm that the current circumstances require.
Thus, further of the individual questions that *atañen to #some Commissioners and that, anyway, belong to the past, have given my vote of confidence, to the new Commission, in the *convencimiento, besides, that the Parliament has of the necessary mechanisms to revoke this confidence marry to be betrayed.
By these reasons, and had account of the generally recognised competition to the Commissioners and of the will manifested by the majority of *ellos to work in narrow collaboration with the Parliament, have voted in favour of the investiture of the European Commission.
So much the reconstruction of *Kosovo like the humanitarian help for the northwest of *Turquía, after the catastrophes that have produced  there, do not admit more delay. It is the moral obligation of the European Union have the necessary financial means.
#If, in the case of *Kosovo, was not necessary to ask the permission to the Council of Security neither expect to the consent of *Milosevic, ?Why in the case of *Timor Oriental is necessary to expect the permission of the Council of Security and obtain the consent of the Mr. *Habibie?
Gentleman President, from the #dutch link with Indonesian, in the first place want to say that *me has amazed to a large extent that in the international juridical order and his maintenance by part of the Council of Security, the world-wide order have shown , again, so extraordinarily #naïve.
In the west do not collect a resolution of the Nations Joined to bomb the #ex *Yugoslavia owing to *Kosovo, that still follows being part of *Yugoslavia, and without embargo up to now have not achieved *decidirnos, by the reasons that are, to launch a military intervention in name of the inhabitants of *Timor.
In this perspective, to initiative of the Council or of the States members, the Commission of Rights Human of the Nations Joined has adopted during the three last varied years resolutions that *preconizan the universal abolition of the capital pity.
Subject: reciprocal Suppression of the compulsory visa among the European Union and other countries In determined States members of the European Union, has suppressed  the compulsory visa for the American citizens that travel to countries members of the Union.
A time that the Commission have presented his proposal on these regulations, the Council will consider, following the principle of reciprocity, the countries that will be *exentos of visa in the States members of the European Union.
Without embargo, want to indicate that the Ministry of Subjects External of States Joined has declared that the competent organ of the program *Attorney General yes has accepted to #Grecia as participant, but that it is necessary to expect the definite processing so that the #greek citizens #can go to States Joined without visa.
The Union underlined to the principle of the negotiations, on 31 March 1998, that the transitory periods that concede  do not have to affect to the norms of the Union neither to his politics or to the normal operation of #the same.
The concrete question that take is #if the Council do not thinks that  *le #can offer to *Marruecos the possibility to take a more rational procedure, because build a nuclear head office to produce 600 *Mw of electricity is "to kill flies to *cañonazos" and believe that it #would be convenient that our neighbours did not take it.
The report of the Mrs. *Pack that are debating today, with the amendment *nº 2, already takes quotation to the collaboration with the *albanokosovares that are desirous to reconstruct his state and  *les has to help to take part in the projects of the European Union and loan his contribution to #the same.
Gentleman President, is very positive the fact that the Parliament involve  for the first time in this subject, has competition *jurisdiccional and, especially by means of the delegation *interparlamentaria, #can take a follow-up of the operation of this service, that, of course, has to organise also the execution of the measures of accompaniment for *reinstalar to the refugees.
The Agreement proposed, #as well as the nine previous signed after the year 1972, establishes the contribution *CE to the budget of the normal programs of the Organism for the next *trienio 1999-2001 and foresees likewise annual negotiations on the contribution of the *CE to the budget of the alimentary help.
The Mrs. *Morgantini has elaborated an excellent report that has my support and the of my Group, and the two amendments are very important, because they ask an annual report and the access to the places, #as well as information on the looks of the finance.
In effect, the deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations are favourable to #one *Europa able to boost the coordination among the different States members, more that to #one *Europa bureaucratic that *preconice a strict regulation and no adapted to the diversities of the geographic and cultural situations.
In the juridical plane, wish to remember that the paper of the European Parliament consists in adapting  to the current juridical foundations and that did not has to, in any case, create #one new, no according to the Treaties signed by the governments of the States members.
In the proposal of resolution appear collected, #among others points, a wish of *traspasar the police collaboration of the *tercer to the *primer *pilar, a wish to award operative competitions to the *Europol and a call to the creation of a Fiscal Ministry common European (*Corpus *Juris).
Besides, it is not casual that the already limited extension the competition of the Court of Justice in the questions that *atañen to the justice and to the internal subjects excepts on purpose the subjects related with the public order and the security.
The Assembly will know perfectly the sophisticated aptitudes of the international criminals to take advantage of  of the different legal disposals and statutory all over the world and infiltrate in the economic and financial systems without repairing in the national borders.
It is incredible that the Central Bank have debugged the help conceded to #the same by the International Monetary Bottom through the corporations of paper that has in the fiscal paradise of the island of Jumper.
These foods Are selling  in the #russian shops, and of this mood ruins  the value of the agricultural production and of the #russian foods #as well as the possibilities of the agriculturalists, and engages his own production.
We have to take all it that was in our hand to turn off the there unchained fire, so that the persons of this part of the world have the possibility to develop his autonomies peacefully and have a future as we have reached already in *Europa.
Without embargo, expect that the president #can take out strengths of the massive support that received in the urns and that act so that the revolutionary court cancel the penalties of death and like this Will go #can continue the path of reforms and of construction of the civil society.
Varied States members contribute in the mission of the 90 military observers of Nations Joined that are deployed in the capitals of the region and in the general barracks of the rebellious groups with the end to supervise the fulfillment of the Agreement of *Lusaka.
Of course, also it #would agree with the call that, #among others, has taken the Mrs. *Maes in favour of the strict suspension of the traffic of arms that follows feeding the conflict in the region and that often has his origin here in the European Union.
The Group of the European Party of Liberal, Democrat and Reformers requests that it do not include  a statement of the relative Commission to the refusal of the #french Government to raise the embargo of the meat of *vacuno #british.
*Cuando Takes some months asked to the representatives of the Commission in the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer on the relative information to the illegal recycling of muds *cloacales in *piensos for animals in #some States members, nobody #can *decirme it that it was the mud *cloacal, where was using  or why.
I believe that *Europa has the obligation to transmit his knowledges and his experience in matter of the AIDS and to back economically to the #african countries that wish to loan his collaboration in his fight against the AIDS and the consequences of #the same.
The loss of youngsters in the flower of the life is *devastadora for the economic development and the productivity, the education, the agriculture and a pile of spheres socioeconomic.
I believe that the question of our obligations to this *respecto and his moral slope #can take that it progress the debate or also that it #can see this debate to the light of the concept of *condicionalidad, of the that do not refuse to take use in regard to these very poor countries that have need of our collaboration and help.
Therefore, exist or it do not exist agreement with the International Monetary Bottom, there will be support to the *ARYM, although it is evident that with the general condition that it apply  the program of reforms necessary so that these bottoms at the end have a concrete effectiveness.
The Commission and the Parliament share the common goal to increase until the 12% the corresponding part to the renewable energies in the gross consumption of energy inside the Community until the year 2010.
The energetic politics elaborates , in effect, with a curtain of bottom: we want to protect the environment, want to reduce the CO2 and, therefore, have to consider, in particular, #if the liberalisation of the #european market of the electricity, #such as it is carrying out in these moments in #some States members, do not results *contraproducente.
The utilisation of the sources of energy renewable constitutes a model of development and application of the most modern technologies, that at the same time also contribute to the protection of the environment, but also has #one *segunda facet.
It treats  of *algo that support clearly in the Socialist Group, but am not of the all safe that the commitment go accompanied of the political resources -that it is #one of the reasons by the that ask that the campaign encourage and boost the renewable energy- or -it that it is more important- of the financial resources.
Of #the same form in that *Pretoria #can receive to the preferences *arancelarias conceded by the European Union, #would have to offer some facilities to his neighbours, since the economic development is indispensable to guarantee the political stability and the peace in the region.
The #south african preference of game had relation with a near agreement to the disposals of the Agreement of *Lomé and the *CNUCED predicts an uneven impact on the currents of exchanges bilateral in detriment of the #south african products.
Gentleman President, like representative of an agricultural country as *Francia, and more still a country that has linked his name and his politics to a true concept of the cooperation with *África, #can not go in #the same sense that the Mrs. *Kinnock and approve the called agreement of trade and cooperation with the #South african Republic, by reasons of form and of bottom.
In our case, in the #italian case, #the same happen by some commissions ascribed, for example, to the Ministry of Industry and to the *cuales, in spite of the work that make in the commissions, hardly #can have access, so as to reach that the bottoms assign  to the States members in measure every time greater.
Only I want to remember that the cultural revolution demands a period of #time longer: in this case, it only that have taken is to change #some places that was of vital importance change because it was necessary to give an example of mobility by countries and by persons; it was necessary to show that the charges are not *vitalicios for nobody.
I am fully in accordance with the points that has mentioned: the reduction of the taxes that tax the societies and his harmonisation are very useful for the #european competition, to the equal that the tax on the performances of the work.
My question has relation with the humanitarian help in the valley of the *Panshir, is to say, in the zone controlled by the resistance to the totalitarian and criminal diet of *Kabul and of the Talibans, of the *cual knows  too much the appalling destination that reserve to the women.
The Commission is conscious of the scope and the possibilities of the different media and carries out two annual surveys of the public opinion with two questions: on the information that have the citizens about the subjects of the EU and how prefer to be informed.
Regarding the programs of rehabilitation. The Commission is in narrow contact with the World-wide Bank and other main donors to formulate a coherent plan, with it that will avert  the duplication of the contributions of donors.
Afterwards they said that it existed a plot organised to earn helps, but the familiar of high charges of the Ministry of Agriculture that earned the helps already cultivated linen before being high charges, before the Mrs. of Palace was Minister of Agriculture and before even that the Mrs. of Palace *les knew.
The past year, more of the half of the total imports of *Turquía proceeded of the European Union, and almost the half of the total of the exports of *Turquía in #the same year directed  to the European Union.
First: had to especially to the initiative of the #greek minister of External Subjects, to the one who want to express here my recognition- has reached  a relation much better -#if well still no optimum- among *Turquía and our country member, #Grecia, having given also a step to the solution of the so important #cypriot question.
The Chancellor *Srenter has declared, also in *Atenas, after a meeting with the Prime minister, Mr. *Simitis, that #would consider an error refer in a public debate, in a conference of press, the conditions that will have to fulfil *Turquía to be considered like country candidate to the adhesion, *algo that gives to understand, create, lady Speaker, that *Turquía has to assume determined conditions before *considerarla country candidate.
Without embargo, the internal development of these countries and, especially, his capacity to fulfil the requirements of the Union, to enjoy also of his rights in #the same, do not adapt  to a term of adhesion so fast like the that *ellos wish.
*Europa, for *nosotros, the liberal democrats, has to follow backing firmly the process of peace and of cooperation in Orient Next, although it has to engage, besides that from the point of sight economic, also in political and cultural terms purchasing a size and a political weight recognised in the region and in the world.
In the #french text and in the #english text says  that "it asks to the religious authorities that cooperate without reservations" - it that, already from the point of sight lexical, differs of the #italian text - but especially "that they take part in the distribution of condoms" .
The approval of these two reports constitutes a guarantee for the #european citizens of the will of the European Union to protect the environment and to reduce, at the same time, our energetic dependency.
Now well, #if well we believe necessary associate *Turquía to the Union to avert #one derives *islamita in this country, also believe that his pure and simple integration to the current structures of the Union, like the European Parliament finishes to request, is impossible.
During decades the #turkish state has pursued to the village *kurdo and *le has denied the obvious right of the minorities to his political rights, social and cultural #as well as the right to his own language, to his own schools and to his own culture.
An important part of the development of the principle of the competition is the liberalisation of the international trade, that in our opinion will not be complete until the *OMC #can take part in the elimination of the obstacles and *tergiversaciones commercial created by private companies.
In our position -and the Presidency of the Council finishes, with reason, to remember it--, exists first of all the worry that the Union do not enclose  in a sectorial negotiation, inscribed in the conclusions of the Cycle of *Uruguay, limited to the agriculture and the services.
#This is especially an appeal to the Council so that it find a uniform #european position and concede to the Commission the full confidence *otorgándole to time a general mandate of negotiation, clearing to #the same time the formal participation of the Parliament.
It Less that #can say  is that these statistics do not endorse totally the idea according to the *cual the progressive dismantlement of the obstacles to the exchanges, after eight cycles of negotiations (from the beginning of the decade of the years 50 until 1994), favoured the economic growth.
The hormones in the beefs are not the most recommended recipe; the elimination of the barriers #can not carry achieve the elimination of the security and of the quality of the products.
The situation in the agricultural fields and *agroalimentario has aggravated  from takes #some years, *cuando theoretically were protected by the cycle of *Uruguay and the agreements of *Marrakech, that supposed  guaranteed and organise the access to the markets, the helps to the exports and the internal helps.
The result of #this is that, in this moment, the European Community is subjecting to an international organism the compulsory solution of his international controversies without having the guarantee that there #be sufficient impartiality.
I believe that in the case of the economy is not necessary, still *cuando do not treat  of an exact science, since the majority of the economists consider, by the reasons that have indicated  takes a moment, that the liberalisation of the exchanges goes by good path.
#This is not so evident with regard to the environment, until the point that the Commission has taken the initiative to initiate a study of the impacts in the environment in relation with the Round that go to launch.
We did not take it because in this period had not thought in *ello, did not have the means for *ello, and the fact to take it today on the base of the cycle of *Uruguay #would not have felt from the point of sight methodological.
It #would be interested in listening it that think the Commissioner and the President in exercise of the Council on the evolution of the common energetic tax, without the *cual the European Union will not be able to carry out his goals in this matter.
According to a report of the *IPCC, for the year 2010 requires  a reduction of the broadcasts of the CO2 of a 35% regarding the year 1999 to be able to limit the promotion of the temperature and of the level of the water of the seas.
Regarding the ratification of the Protocol of *Kioto, #would indicate that as it has not got  to agreements on the norms of control of the fulfillment of the commitments, neither on the regulations of the mechanisms of performance, *nos find with that we #would not know for sure it that are ratifying.
The coordination of the structural Bottoms to the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *nº1 is elaborated by the Commission and the Been member in question. Like this as, the cast of the structural Bottoms is not competition of the Council, but of the States members.
Obviously there #be *incumplimientos, there are delays of more of four months in the communications of lists, there #be more ships that before -among a 57% and a 63%, more in *Irlanda and in *Inglaterra- *cuando had to have less, there are damages to the ecosystem, there are damages to the economy of the persons and are not  incorporating the recommendations of the *ICCAT.
Gentleman President, like the Mr. deputy knows, so much in the preferential deal in the commercial relations as in the granting of the bottoms *PHARE and in the subjects related with the agreements will apply  the regional approaches foreseen by the European Union foreseen for the *Sudeste of *Europa.
Regarding the agreements, the Council signalled that the negotiations for the agreement of cooperation and stabilisation, that is the new modality of bilateral agreement among the Union and the countries of the *Sudeste of *Europa, will be begun, *basándonos in the reports of the Commission, *cuando *Croacia fulfil the criteria established.
The States members #can resort to the instruments that have created  to community level for *paliar the possible effects of the suppression of the free sales of taxes, instruments that were exposed by the Commission in a communiqué directed to the Council on 17 February 1999.
We go to explain shortly with reports of varied governments, therefore, this project of resolution results extremely current. The resolution remembers once again to the governments, to *través of the Parliament and of the Council, that, like Parliament, - *me cheers a lot that #all the groups have put  of agreement on this project of resolution -take really upsetting in that, in fact, present serious reports.
I think that we are wall to obtain a *primer big result in the General Assembly of the Nations Joined and that suits to concentrate to procure that the final text was a true text, a text that *nos allow to continue this battle, that -as they have said other orators- this Parliament takes so seriously.
Indonesian will not survive #if it did not knows  find a solution for the violence that reproduces  in #a lot of islands, #if it did not reaches  the respect of the minorities inside a democratic structure and #if there #be not place for the regional autonomy.
. (IN) In relation with the capital pity: during the three last years the Commission of Rights Human of the Nations Joined has approved a resolution on the pity of death with an every time greater number of *copatrocinadores.
The Commission, by pipe of his programs of assistance in the sphere of the democratisation and the human rights, follows supporting the measures allocated to boost the confidence and the dialogue among the different communities.
This Parliament has to force to #all the States involved and to #all the Institutions to close this chapter that represents #one of the #many #italian mysteries that do not find the path of the truth and that certainly has his roots in the high spheres and the collusions.
Of course, *nos impresses the fact that in a country in the that already there are 51 reactors and the commitment to build other 20 but, do not have the suitable knowledges and the sufficient experience to avert these events.
The questions posed in the proposals of resolution about the manufacture, the transport and the utilisation of oxides mixed -the fuel *MOX- do not have at all that see with the accident of the head office of *Tokaimura.
I conclude, after giving the graces again to the Mr. President of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, #as well as to the Commission of Control Budgetary, with a pray to the House: that it approve the report of the Mr. *Napolitano.
With this directive in the that treats  of the first normative frame of this type all over the world, the European Union gives a *primer decisive step to the regulation and, to #the same time, to the promotion of the electronic trade in the breast of the Community.
On the one hand, they establish  #few rules, but clearly clear-cut, on the requirements that have to fulfil the electronic signatures, but, on the other hand, the States members #can decide in how cases instrumented these signatures to the traditional demonstrations of will, for example to the signature of fist and letter, to the form written or to other documentary proofs.
As I understand the situation, these versions #can pose a grave threat for the market due to the fact that #some of his disposals seem to lessen the principle of the country of origin, that, as it knows the Parliament, is the base in that it founded  the only market.
Of course the velocimeters are adapted to introduce automatically a threshold of inhibition during the driving, because of it contrary -#this is like this, lamentably- the very elevated speeds for the that these vehicles are not prepared, as have the centre of gravity very high, etc., will have effects *desfavorables.
Besides, the velocimeter already is #one of the accessories of series in the majority of the available vehicles in the market of the EU, without that #this influence of significant way in the final price of the vehicle.
It has got the moment that in the European Union opt  by a *presupuestación based in the activity, by an administration in the that  *rindan explain by means of the results, by the delegation of powers and competitions to inferior levels and by the explanation of the personal competitions.
The first was to conciliate the budgetary nomenclature in relation with the clear-cut priorities in the Treaty of *Amsterdam and, especially, the fact that from now the creation of a space of freedom, of security and of justice is #one of the fundamental goals of the Union.
Finally, gentleman President, talking like member of the #greek representation, wanted to express my weigh, because the #european institutions still have not found a correct juridical base to be able to loan help to a Been member that recently has suffered the consequences of the natural catastrophes.
Also I seat that the Commission of Budgets did not approve to move the training of the nuclear inspectors in the ancient Soviet Union of the line of politics external to the of energy, with the that said training #can make of form much more effective.
The supplementary bottoms conceded for the new places of the Veterinary and Phytosanitary Office of *Dublín will convince to our citizens that are taking measured to protect the quality and the security of the food that put in the plate.
The Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities asks that it apply  in this context a wide interpretation of the concept of health, that include so much the physical welfare as also the psychic and social welfare.
By this reason want to underline that the backrest of the majority of the Group *ELDR to the strategy presented by the speaker, Mr. *Bourlanges and that has by object *rebatir the general cut of a 10% of the external costs is not sample of fault of will to find forms to save.
It is evident that the circumstances of the years happened -the resignation of the Commission and the reports of the Committee of Experts- *nos warn of the need that *nos procure a base that *nos take to entrust in a wise administration of the bottoms.
And we want to that the States members face up to the exceptional circumstances, and the reconstruction of *Kosovo is an exceptional circumstance, with exceptional solutions that do not have to look for through a simple linear cut tax to the Parliament in his lines and in his programs.
#This do not has to suppose at all an increase of the public cost in *Europa, but demands that each State, #all the #european States are had to transfer to the Union the corresponding resources to the transfer in fact of the competitions.
During this long and intense month of transactions, the Parliament encouraged  in taking see to the Council that no only of *FEOGA and structural Bottoms lives the Union, and that the remaining 20% of the budget also served to the goals of the Union and that, often, affected to subjects very sensitive politically.
In consequence, the reasons to approve or refuse the Budget only #can base in the grade in that the definition of the central axes of the political answer to the own approaches and in #if the endowment of resources financial for said political is sufficient.
In a world *cambiante, have to be in conditions to undertake adjust of the budget much more quickly, so that without increasing the global budget #can answer to new needs, for example and very especially, to the development of the new countries members of *Europa Oriental, but also to the humanitarian help in cases of catastrophe and to the reconstruction of the *Balcanes, that do not have to be funded with reductions in the help to the *tercer world.
The new Commission proposes  apply the different criteria that *ustedes have gone back to expose for the adjudication and supervision of the works hired with offices of technical assistance, so as to determine clearly of how looks will have to commission  the public administration and #which will be able to entrust  to the offices of assistance technical.
Without embargo, since these visits to the #ECB are of character more informal, is not necessary to say that they have to consider like a supplementary instrument of communication among both institutions and that #can not consider a substitute of the periodic public audiences in the European Parliament.
Try use the monetary politics to increase the real economic activity above his sustainable level will not take but produce in the long run a still greater inflation, no an economic growth faster.
Although the contribution that takes when keeping the stability of the prices do not has to  overlook, the monetary politics clearly #can not resolve the grave structural problem of the unemployment in the zone of the euro.
Said coordination #would tend to diminish the democratic responsibility, to reduce the transparency of the political frame of face to the public opinion and to increase the uncertainty on the sectorial performances, looming potentially with *desestabilizar the economy.
In the actuality, the results of the systems of payment to the by minor *transfronterizos carry a clear delay regarding the political goals of the Economic and Monetary Union and, even, to the expectations of #a lot of citizens and small #european companies.
After the introduction of the notes and coins of euros on 1 January 2002, these differences regarding the levels of service of the national payments and *transfronterizos inside the zone of the only coin will take  even more evident.
#This shows that the #ECB takes  seriously his responsibility to support other common economic goals, in particular the of the employment, and *nosotros know that the circumstantial bonanza in the European Union, in spite of the evolution differentiated inside the zone "euro 11" , will follow requiring support.
*Unicamente A total transparency of the report among the goals fixed by the Treaty and the actions of the members of the Council will allow to the Europeans appreciate #if the members of the Council fulfil correctly with his mission, *algo that *nosotros do not doubt.
Gentleman President, nine months after the launching of the euro and blurred the enthusiasm by his future paper like the main currency of international reservation owing to the weakness of the types of change, #can not  announce to the four winds a hit without *calificativos.
Also it resulted garbled yesterday listen that the Mr. *Issing, economist boss of the #ECB, when seeming had declared in *Londres that the Bank #would not publish his economic forecasts for the territory of the euro, perpetuating a culture of the secret.
I believe that it #would be well that thought in a new system and that #would owe *preguntarnos how #can guarantee a better parliamentary collaboration with a series of countries in roads of development and with the countries of *Europa Central and Oriental, to the that go to help, and do not say it because the *ONG do not go to follow being there, but because I believe that it is an image *algo mistaken the that give of the consolidation of the democracy #if we say that only the *ONG #can take part actively.
Gentleman President, his visit to the European Parliament produces  in a moment in the that #all the #colombian population in his group has manifested #alto and clear his wish of peace civil, of democracy and of respect by the human rights.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate on the report of the European Council and the statement of the relative Commission to the results of the European Council of the past days 15 and 16 October in *Tampere.
Like this it takes  in the conclusions of the necessary form to attend the legitimate worries of the citizens in matter of security and judicial guarantee of his rights, as it is norm in a Union that pretends to base in the principle of *prevalencia of the right and of the law.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, Prime minister *Lipponen, *me #one to the vision that the European Council of *Tampere #can be considered historical, due to the fact that it is the first time that the Council has treated and has put in command of the #european diary the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice.
Our Group adds  to the idea of the Council that the Union and his States members reinforce the opening of the Union to the rest of the world in the field of the personal relations, cultural, political and economic.
And in this sense, believe that here it opens  a new important front and support also -as we have taken with the initiative of the Parliament- the creation of the bottom of refugees, that believe that it #can be a very decisive element.
I will give only an example among the #many that #can give : the priority awarded to the cooperation against the juvenile delinquency in the cities *nos seems *algo odd and out of place, since for *reprimirla really the States #would take better in intensifying his efforts of cooperation to eradicate the delinquency organised that acts increasingly to scale international.
*Me Seems also that the Commission, in the new spirit of *Tampere and like watchdog of the community juridical legislation, #would have to take fulfil the directives to pursue the bleaching of money, #whose *incumplimiento is preventing an effective judicial cooperation, as, for example, in the case of *Gibraltar.
But in a more general plane, and in particular *cuando has treated of questions of immigration, the Council has sunk  in two contradictions that, by it other, remit, the two, to his fault of value political or to the mutual paralysis of his members: we do not know well.
Without embargo, a restructuring #can be intelligent, is to say, #can take into account the social and economic cost; and it #can be short of sight, is to say, #can take into account today the economic cost and pay the social cost a lot afterwards, because they are #many the factors that go to influence negatively in a company that do not takes into account the social dimension.
In front of the new technologies and to the revolution of the information, there #be place for a new conception of the productivity, based no in the rationing of the social costs, but in the promotion of the human capacities.
Then they have value to watch of front the reality: the employees of *Michelin are not victims of the direction of *Michelin, but of His *Señorías, merchants of the *mundialismo, as also they are it the employees of the banking sector, of the insurances, of the car sector and #many #others, #whose companies merge , move  or restructure  to be able to survive.
Yesterday this Parliament asked to the President *Duisenberg that subjected the monetary politics to the needs of growth of #one *Europa that do not knows to reform, that do not knows to reform the economies and that neither knows to liberalise the markets, especially the market of work.
In this frame, *nos find in front of the difficult problem of the transfers: difficult, as, obviously, destroy put of work in *Europa; difficult, as #the same that the *vilipendian today demand, simultaneously, that *Europa multiply the investments in the countries in roads of development and facilitate to the maximum the entrance in the territory of the European Union of pertinent products of these countries.
But, said *eso, the that believe in the market and *militamos in this part of the Hemicycle, far of the autarchic temptations of a side and #another of the Assembly, believe that the principle of compensation social has to balance the principle of a market that work.
In this document refers, as, "the #european companies consider that they are an inseparable part of the society; #this means that they act of a socially responsible way: they consider the benefits his main goal, but no the only reason of his existence.
Perhaps it owe  to that fear difficulties in the verification and to that the prohibition #can allow to countries like *Corea of the North and *Irak make proofs of low level, or perhaps fear that by means of the permanent cessation of the proofs, the States Joined #can see *mermados his nuclear arsenal and his strength of deterrence.
To finalise, wish to support again it that the Parliament agreed on 18 November of the past year; it supported the statements of the eight States of 9 June 1998, the *new diary *coalition, a definite elimination and total of the nuclear arms.
Gentleman President, want to have hopes in that the decision of the Senate of the States Joined is a form of *esquivar provisionally the ethical obligation that has the *superpotencia world-wide in front of the world-wide public opinion, like country that has to be *vanguardista in the politics of reduction of the nuclear danger.
*Muchísimos States have abandoned of voluntary form the possession of this type of arms. The great states, that have of nuclear arms, have reduced considerably his arsenals of arms nuclear, but #can not be really satisfied with *ello.
It wanted to ask to the Commissioner *Patten, #if still *me listens, #if it agrees *conmigo in that #this reinforces the need of an external politics and of effective #european defence, that *nos allow to undertake measures with independence - no already depend, but rather protect our security so that it do not see  *vapuleada constantly by the winds of the national politics American and by the presidential elections of the States Joined.
I expect with interest the end of the discussion that has announced the speaker of the Commission of Budgets in relation with the form of assignment of the means in the chapter To 30 of the budget for the year 2001.
Now that talk of the *Europa of the next century, the new and big *Europa, the *Europa of the enlargement, #would not result, perhaps, advantageous launch in this moment, once and for all, a brave cultural politics, since the culture is not *algo on it that have to treat  of #the same form that treat  the purportedly important subjects.
*Permítaseme Also an observation by it that refers  to the amendment 12: this amendment is accepted keeping some flexibility to end to be able to approximate, on this concrete point, during the stage of conciliation, the positions of the Council and of the Parliament.
The Commission accepts the amendment 13, that proposes criteria *indicativos of budgetary distribution among the great cultural spheres, to the time that increases of 9% to 11% the percentage in favour of the actions in the sector of the book and the reading, #whose mount annual #would diminish noticeably in comparison with the program *Ariane.
The new line affects to the preparatory measures of the audiovisual sector and do not takes any reference to the section 3 of the ancient article 130, relative to the industrial development and to the decisions in #whose virtue of established the program *Eureka Audiovisual.
It is to regret that, like result of the vote of the commission of culture, youth, education, communication and sport, go  to present that the finance of the Audiovisual Observatory guarantee  for only three years, against of the posture, in #others, of the president of said parliamentary commission, Mr. *Gargani, that presented a report to the *respecto.
Now well, in the budget of the European Parliament, in the *rúbrica 3710, read with surprise the following formulation: "Contributions in favour of the political parties Europeans" , with the following explanation: "The Commission #would have to, it before possible, subject a statute of parties political Europeans" .
The past year, the Court of Justice of the Communities condemned severely the fact to engage budgetary costs without legal base by the Commission, with the complicity of the European Parliament.
The countries industrialised, in group, and the States members of the Union, in particular, do not owe *desentenderse of the help to the development, since *ello #would have sanitary repercussions, social, economic and grave politics in the always fragile balance of the most disadvantaged countries.
*Me Seems a grave political error that, #if the Council and the Commission have established a system by means of the *cual his own members, the Commissioners, the Ministers and Bosses of Government of the States members, #can be investigated in case of irregularity, #can not be it the deputies.
The company *Michelin, that finishes to proceed, in *Francia, to a series of dismissals controversial, finds , precisely, in a situation of this gender, since his main competitor produces pneumatic in the countries of the East, to coast of wages five less high times.
The truth is that the Managerial frame went in in vigour in January of 1997 and the present proposal of the Commission treats to resolve the problems of application of the transitory disposals on the containers for the transport of gases and on the *cisternas.
In another order of things, to the Mr. *Pohjamo *le #would answer that the Directive 96/35 on the advisers of security, that will go in in vigour from 1 January 2000, has to contribute to the application of the legislation on transport of dangerous commodities, *hacerla more transparent and more in accordance with it that #all pretend.
In front of *usted, gentleman *Fischler, believe that it is not necessary to insist once again in the importance of this agreement with *Marruecos for some States members, as *España and *Portugal, and for determined autonomous communities, as *Galicia, *Andalucía and Canarian, #all *ellas, as it is known, inside the Goal 1, very dependent of the fishing and, for the time being, without *caladeros alternative for his fleets and with a business structure that disables some forms of cooperation.
It was *usted a Commissioner in functions and *yo *me adhere to the simile of my mate *Varela *Suanzes-*Carpegna bear *decirle that here has *usted a good bull, a *miura bear *lidiar; it undertake *usted a fine negotiation, *llévela to good port, defend *usted, gentleman Commissioner, the interests of the #european fishermen like the #moroccan Government will defend the interests of the #his.
Therefore, to the equal that the sector, believe that this time -and in this case seat especially that it was not the Council, because to *él is to the one who mainly *me direct- have to *plantarnos and give the signal that, #if well we carry years asking and begging that  *nos allow to take part, as simple observers, in the negotiations of the agreements of fishing, now already, gentleman President, #can not postpone this participation.
They #can be insurances of a thing: although to the principle of the present debate have not enumerated #all the factors that leave of self-evident the importance of this agreement, especially for the sector *pesquero #spanish and also for the economy *pesquera #portuguese, am very conscious of the transcendence that has.
Have understood that my colleague the Commissioner *Byrne and the president of the Scientific Committee Director have summoned a conference of press in *Bruselas for this afternoon to the 18 hours, in the that will give to know the results of the meeting of the scientists.
Perhaps the Mr. *Parish #can send a copy of his speech to the boss of his party, because lamentably, in Big *Bretaña, the boss of his favourable party that forbid  the import of products #french in the Realm Joined.
With an embargo and a prohibition of export do not combats  the illness *EEB. In this way, it proceeds  to the location of the problem and creates  an instrument that allows to implant the rule of security #european stipulated by the Commission.
In *Francia, this Agency of Security Sanitary Alimentary established  thanks to the pressure of the population, of the consumers and, clear is, of the environmentalists and of the Group of the Greens in the European Parliament.
Meanwhile, the authorities of the Realm Joined have prepared his own system of relative labeling to the plan of *inocuidad of the meat of bovine and have indicated that this system of labeling, with voluntary character, #would work in relation with the exports to *Francia and to other countries.
This Committee is the that celebrated the vote and issued a *dictamen unanimous, after having examined #all the information that appeared in the report of the Special Committee and #some other documents facilitated by the Special Group and, obviously, applying his own scientific knowledges.
The Commission has of an unanimous report of the best scientists and veterinary of the European Union, that have expressed his opinion that the meat of bovine #british exported with arrangement to the plan of export according to a calendar established is so innocuous like any #another of *Europa.
Gentleman President, the #european pacts on the employment, the processes of *Cardiff, of *Luxemburgo, of Colony and the combination among *ellos, the dialogues *macroeconómicos, the technical organs and politicians of these dialogues do not tend to boost the employment in *Europa positively for the workers.
*Me Seems to understand that, further of #some statements of principle, there #be not at all effective, do not exists any proposal, there #be not any rigorous analysis, although the analysis of the state of health of #a lot of #european economies, in particular continental, #would have to be it.
By #this *nosotros want *hacerles a very concrete question: When they go to reach agreements in the that they establish  concrete criteria that allow to evaluate in how measured #can contribute the public investments to the consolidation of the process of growth, with effects also clearly positive in the market of work?
How resulted #can have the structural unemployment, the unemployment of long length, the juvenile unemployment and the efforts made with the politics of the employment and the 22 lines guidelines, with the plans of action of the countries members?
In fact, *yo go to go more far and ask the exclusion of the workers that take part in the preparation of fish cool -and underline: cool fish-, because in the case of the fish there #be not a continuity of supply.
According to the study of the Commission, in the moment in that it approved  the original directive on the labour day in *Irlanda the doctors of hospital no specialists worked more of the 65 hours allowed to the week and exerted tasks *indistinguibles of the of his upper colleagues.
The quoted study enumerates also the following questions: fixation of turns no realistic, prolonged periods of continuous service, distribution of the tasks among auxiliary and upper doctors, pressures no official to the doctors in period of training, vulnerability of the periods of rest and the rhythm of pressures and needs of the service.
The problem that  *nos poses in the case of Chinese -already has signalled  *justificadamente and also  *nos poses with other countries- is the of the human rights, to the *cual it is necessary to add, in the case of Chinese, the problem of the *Tíbet, the gestures *amenazadores to *Taiwan, etc.
By it that refers  to the possible contribution of the network Internet, think that by means of this type of contacts and also, as it has said His *Señoría on purpose of the electronic trade, thanks to this type of agreements scientific there will be #any forms of possible dialogue in the future.
*Nos Have seen forced to work quickly, but on the other hand, also *me *atrevo to say that I regret the that my Group have not reached the agreement of the commission on a series of points that consider *prioritarios. It is therefore, gentleman *Pronk, by it that have decided to go back to present these amendments that *nos seem fundamental.
To our opinion, is recommended that also in this field the States members guide  by the behaviour of the three countries of the Union that obtain the best results, as it has come  taking in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union European and the own politics of employment.
Frankly hardly I #can believe that this proposal to initiate a process of *Luxemburgo for the social security have been refused in commission by our colleagues of the *PPE, in spite of constituting the core of the Report *Pronk that vote in the previous Parliament.
Thus, we think like members of the *ELDR that with the package on the employment has found  a fine solution to the problem of how conciliate the principle of subsidiariness with the wish to guarantee a coordination of the politics of employment.
The reports of the countries members on the mood in that they fulfil the guidelines no only show how these countries  the are fixing by separate but that also open the path for a reciprocal inspiration, in the *cual some countries #can learn of the fine results of #others.
The *UEM has succeeded in the measure that a coordination of this nature has made possible to reach the common goals that the countries proposed  for the inflation, for the types of interest and for the budgetary deficit.
*Cuando The money #would have to be using to answer to the needs of women and men, to the needs of our societies, the subject *Michelin symbolises the dictatorship of the law of the money on the economy and the persons.
Investigations that finish to publish  in *Gales, country that represent, show once again that the women follow having a very low representation in the places of direction of the companies and that do not rise in the professional career with the rapidity that #would fit to expect of his aptitudes.
In this context, *me remit also to the experiment of reduction of the VAT in the sector services, the *cual was approved properly by the Council, but seem to be that the States members are not it setting up, except #some exceptions. At least regarding my country, *Finlandia, had wished a different solution to the *respecto.
Before we happen to the next batch of votes on the report *Smet, #can concede to the Mrs. *Smet the opportunity to clear, so that it state in Record, a look that did not have the opportunity to clear at the end of the debate of yesterday in relation with the fishermen to the part that are autonomous.
It is necessary, especially, tackle a reform and a modernisation of the education and in the training that benefit to #all, without any discrimination that base  in the half social or in the person, and that incorporate the technological and computer changes, #as well as combat *encarnizadamente #all the forms of unemployment and of precarious work.
It treats  of a subject essentially politician in the that it sees  to the conservative right flirt with the precariousness and to the strengths of the left try put in foot the social convergence, insisting in the relation among the employment, his quality and the social protection.
The use of facilities fiscal like "carrot" for the renewal of the old and heavy *utilitarios, is entirely justified, #as well as the fiscal advantages directed to the respectful vehicles with the environment: all #this so that it accelerate  the introduction of vehicles less *contaminantes.
Gentleman *Lange, perhaps #can *usted try once again reach with the Council a commitment in a nocturnal session, so that *nos see free of a decision in consciousness to vote against of his excellent report, in favour of the *cual *me #would enjoy to vote, or -almost is necessary to say it now- against of the environment, since all goes back again to the tail of wait.
The Commission believes that the state of development of the necessary technology to apply limitations so severe to the oxides of nitrogen hampers in these moments the acceptance of a previous date to October of the 2008.
Besides, *cuando in the 2001, in the Nations Joined, take  a balance of the First World-wide Summit of the Boys, suggest that in our Parliament believes  a European Parliament of the Boys, prepared with *ellos, to celebrate this European World-wide Summit in the 2001.
But also I want to believe that, under the responsibility of the Commission, #can think  in promoting a comparative study of the incorporation of the Convention of the Rights of the Boy to the national legislations of #a lot of States members.
The reason of this question is to ask to the Commission no only that it express  of clear form respect to the proposals of the Parliament, but especially *preguntarle by the modalities and the terms of presentation of his version reviewed in relation with the position of the Parliament.
Although after the elections outline  in this Assembly a new and distinct majority and although there are amendments that the members of the *ELDR appreciate more that #others, yes, although there are elements of the proposal that *nos had enjoyed that they had remained  was, back this initiative on the query and the announcement of the action.
On the other hand, the *segunda big amendment said that #if the direction of a company retained information to the representatives of the workers, had to take possible of a sanction, and no only in the case of the retentions of information that the directions of the companies judged important, that is a concept very little precise.
Like this, the worse salaried workers paid and even the unemployed or the that *carecen of domicile, when paying the VAT on his foods, contribute to fund the #european institutions that, without embargo, have not taken an alone measure in his favour.
In the current system did not exists already the transparency because of the numerous individual regulations relative to the tax of collection of the VAT, to the #british discount and his finance.
Besides, the Commission refers  to this evolution, #as well as to the experience purchased of his application until the actuality to get to his current proposal that aspires to modify and reinforce the valid directive the *cual *atañe, especially, to the sector of the agricultural costs.
But in the global transfer, that forms part of the three instruments, and that the Commission *nos had presented to increase the credits of payment, part of this group did not happens by this procedure in the Plenary.
But, as I already have indicated, it has not loaned  attention to another big number of environmental looks. Of this form #can not  talk here at all of a more effective integration of the environmental dimension in the energetic politics.
We believe that the fishermen will be able to enjoy of a better protection regulating the labour day or the time of rest by days or by weeks, as it proposes the Council, before that by a fixed limit of 48 hours inside a period of reference of 12 months.
There #be not, gentleman President, formal #european citizenships, there #be #european citizenship *cuando in the most next of #all the branches of the right, the civil right, *Europa also has legitimacy and strength to guarantee rights of the citizens and impose the justice.
But it exists -and here the words of the Commissioner have been very clear- the absolute need to plant in *primer plane the nuclear security and expect that #this #such as it has said it *usted, gentleman Commissioner, was the guideline and the base of the negotiations with our neighbours of the *Europa Oriental.
From then it finds  *algo *empolvado in a drawer of the Minister for the Protection of the Consumers, the Mrs. *Prammer. But thanks to the positive cooperation with the *ONG occupied in environmental subjects, knew of the existence of said study and from the past Thursday *nos have been able to occupy in depth of his content.
To fault of official procedures to raise the prohibition inside the EU, the situation results even more difficult, as they testify it the #british management to reach the lifting of the prohibition in third countries, included the States Joined, and in his partners of the *Commonwealth.
It wanted to *decirle to the gentleman Commissioner that here there #be had some agreements that have established clearly two obligations by part of both sides: the States Joined engaged  to modify the title *IV of the law and to not applying the law to #european companies.
Subject: *Timor Oriental In the session of the European Parliament of the past 5 October, the Commissioner *Patten informed of the absolute priority that concedes the European Commission to the subject of the humanitarian help and to the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
The Commission is preparing guidelines on the supervision and the presentation of reports together with the States members that will allow to take comparisons and add the results and the maps from the year 2000, *cuando the States members inform on the repercussions of his first programs of action.
I know that it has to , of course, and the Commission knows the important economic measures and social that have to adopt the States members with a very intensive production to adapt the structures and the methods *agropecuarios to the requirements of the directive.
In it that refers , gentleman *Pohjamo, *Señorías, to the list of the admissible regions, wanted to remember that the Commission had directed to the States members a letter, on 1 July 1999, *pidiéndoles present his proposals before 31 August 1999.
I want to require, #if have the time, that requires  a big flexibility, open, for each Been member, but have to find, in the map that will be finally approved in the frame of the Goal 2, at least the half of the population that initially identified  like inhabitant in the eligible zones of compliance with the community criteria.
I expect that at the end of this year we receive the reactions of the States members and of this Parliament so that we #can begin immediately to the beginning of the year 2000 to present a specific #european legislation on this question and follow exerting pressures for the ratification of the Agreement of 1993.
Second, in the field of *Eurocontrol, and no only in the of *Eurocontrol but in #all the fields, have to guarantee the efficiency and transparency in the operation of the providers of services aerial and, besides, carry out the division among it that they are the statutory responsibilities and the provision of services.
It #can the Commission describe the general situation regarding the measures adopted by the countries candidates for *modernizar his systems of security social and, on the other hand, inform of the measures adopted and foreseen to contribute to the effort of the countries candidates to this *respecto?
It is it that have taken in the past and will follow it taking in the future, #if well I want *indicarle that here the practical is very diverse, is to say, that is not true that the majority of the candidates to the adhesion was by behind the standards of the States members in this question.
Subject: The enlargement of the Union and the agreement of *Schengen The countries candidates will have to assume the legislation of the EU in matter of expedition of visas and controls of entrance in the borders of the EU. #This involves a considerable change in the practices of #some of these countries.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Secretary of the Council and High Representative for the External Politics and of Common Security, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, in the first place want to hail the appearance of the Mr. #Solana in his triple condition of General Secretary of the Council, High Representative for the External Politics and of Common Security and General Secretary of the *UEO, for the moment *in *pectore.
In the exercise of his new responsibilities, will have *usted in my Group to a demanding speaker, #if it gets the case, severely critical, but deeply convinced that the European Union has to be more present, be more active, more *voluntarista in the international scene.
And more *parabienes, but #this seriously, as simple suggestion, for the external politics and of common security. Probably follow the procedure of the Economic and Monetary Union with regard to a diplomatic union and soldier #can be a fine suggestion to translate the statements of principle in steps more concrete.
The permanent dialogue with the previous Commissioner, *Sir *Leon *Brittan, along 1998 and in the first months of 1999 contributed, on the other hand, to that the Communication of the Commission of 14 July 1999 incorporated #many of the approaches of the European Parliament and all his content.
We consider likewise fundamental the principles of caution and alimentary security, because we do not want that *nos invade the foods *transgénicos, and by #this consider necessary to invest the charge of the proof and that the experts are really independent of the interests of the Governments and of the multinationals.
The point of game of the Report *Haug was that the position of March past, especially the relative point to the elimination of #all the clauses of exception, has to carry now to the practice.
I create, thus, *parafraseando it that the Mr. *Patten said during his intervention, that is bad to trade with states that violate the human rights of massive form - *él referred  then to Chinese in answer to a #ours question - and that, in fact, also is well not forgetting the financial and economic measures *cuando treats  to issue a clear signal.
Our negotiators have to encourage by that these countries really take part to *través of the institutional support, the free entrance in our markets, the fulfillment of the #granting agreed -for example, *cuando treat  of the textile products- and the prevention of the called "green protectionism" .
The one who pleads by the demolition of the #european agricultural politics, pleads, simultaneously, by the destruction of #everything it that in *Europa has reached in the field of the rural politics, of the welfare of the animals and of the welfare of the persons.
By the contrary, *cuando the deficit of integration results of the internal politics or of deficient development, the extension of the terms of application, the multiplication of measures preferential, do not constitute fine solutions.
I take the word, in this case in name of the Commission of Budgets, to mention the main points that said commission considers important that treat  in the Conference of reform of the Treaties, splitting of the base that the that lives out of the budget in politics lives in the error.
#This includes also the division of the Council of Ministers -#such as it proposed the Report *Dehaene- in a Council of Ministers executive, that #can celebrate his sessions to enclosed door, and a Council of Ministers legislative, #whose meetings #would have to be public.
The positions expressed in the report of the Gentlemen *Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen were reinforced by the illustrated to the Parliament, with the communications of the President *Prodi and of the Mr. *Barnier, in name of the European Commission the day after the vote in our commission.
In any case, the problem that poses the *legitimación of a space or a market without State requires that we take an attempt, that has to go accompanied of the creation of a #european civil society and the training of a #european public opinion.
In October, in the special meeting of the Council of *Europa in *Tampere on the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice, took  upsetting, among other things, in the importance to confront the problems derived of the drug in his whole.
The complementary question that take to the Council is #if it #can consider the possibility to go in in contact with the #moroccan Government so as to avert that it undertake now this absolutely dangerous adventure for *Marruecos and, of course, for *nosotros, his more next neighbours.
Gentleman President, do not take the word to take part on the content of bottom of the question of the Mr. *Alavanos, but to take a comment and direct afterwards a question to the Mr. Minister on purpose of the answer that has given.
It #would be necessary to clear it before possible the obstacles for the opening of the *Danubio, but has not been possible to begin to cooperate in this sense, and *Jugoslavia neither has adopted any measure to open the *Danubio, although yes it #would be #his responsibility in virtue of the international agreements.
Now well, #if we do not have time to examine the question this morning, #if there #be *demasiados orators inscribed to take the word in relation with the Report *Napolitano and with the Report *Giannakou, then will second the proposal of the Mr. *Pirker that we do not vote tomorrow on the question.
Gentleman President, so only want to remember that the article 115 of the Regulation, already applied regarding the Report *Napolitano, foresees that "except in the cases of urgency foreseen in the articles 50 and 112, only will be able to  proceed to the debate and to the vote of a text #if #this has been distributed with *veinticuatro hours of *antelación like minimum" .
Five months ago that the Parliament #would have to have accepted this agreement, and *me seems that the public opinion simply will not appreciate a new refusal to follow advance and to establish a rigorous diet but *equitativo for the Parliament, the same that for the other organs.
#This constitutes a general permission to an authority, that no only leaves to the deputies to favour of any complaint, but that creates a system of delation and of political agitation that supposes an insult to the free mandate and to a free Parliament.
Without embargo, estimate that the debates of this Parliament, of our parliamentary commission have been sufficient to be able to elaborate a good report like #this with the support of the greater part of the political Groups and congratulate to the speaker by his work.
In my opinion, the communication of the Commission represents a good point of game for the development of a world-wide #european strategy, *multidisciplinaria and integrated of fight against the illicit drugs in accordance with the that approved the General Assembly of the Nations Joined in 1998.
I believe that a Parliament that do not has the value to amend a situation of patent discrimination that reaches to #some of his members and to millions of #european citizens, is a Parliament that #can not teach, as it #would want to and as it #can, the democracy to #a lot of countries that have condemned even this morning.
As *ustedes have underlined it, simultaneously to the promotion of the foundations of the economy, the emergency of a political power that was to the height of his task and the development of the necessary institutions will be essential elements.
Against of it that finishes to say #ours colleague, think that in this occasion exist reasons more that sufficient so that *nos congratulate by the fact that the European Union, by unanimity, have presented a resolution in front of the Nations Joined so as to ask a moratorium for the pity of death.
Gentleman President, am totally in accordance with the Mrs. *Díez *González on the need to treat to convince to the Council, so that it introduce in the agreements with the third countries a clause on the pity of death and his abolition.
And while all *eso occurs, the *LIV General Assembly of the UN did not approve the proposal of resolution of the #finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union that advocated the suspension of the executions of penalties of death.
*Nosotros Have taken part immediately, to title of the humanitarian help, with an amount of more of a million of euros, in three successive operations, and are had to continue taking part to answer to the most urgent needs of the next year.
We are absolutely conscious of the deplorable situation in the that find  #a lot of boys, and especially the girls, in *Pakistán; but we think that the most effective way to improve this situation is contributing to guarantee a universal primary education of quality and affordable.
The Convention on the Rights of the Boy recognises that the progenitors are responsible to provide the had to taken care and the owed attention to his children, #as well as the right of the children to receive this care, this orientation and this love.
Thus it #can not have a politics of drugs #european *reglamentada, but a #european frame inside the *cual #can help  to the person affected, that has to be the centre, from the respective specific experiences of the local and regional instances competent.
Everywhere #where reach to prevent that the pertinent illegal money of the traffic of drugs transform  in legal money, give a big step forward, because the fight against the traffic of drugs and the bleaching of money are two phenomenons related.
Finally, I want to signal that, in this field, the European Observatory of *Lisboa exerts an important work, and am convinced that in the next years the data and the information that there collect  will show the effectiveness of the #european cooperation, and international, in this fight.
*Cuando This Parliament and the public opinion were surprised by informations transmitted by the press, according to the *cuales an institution, that, as we thought, devoted  only to structural investments, had lost sums very elevated in speculative operations in the short term, resulted clear the need to examine of form *cabal the politics of investments of the *BEI.
We are convinced that, with the suitable means, the European Observatory of the Drug and the *Toxicomanías, situated in *Lisboa, #can take an important contribution to the deepening of the study and of the proposals of measures to struggle against this *flagelo of the drug.
With #everything, is the fact that the debate and the vote have taken place in spite of the article 115 of the Regulation, had account that the last #french version was distributed to the 21.52 hours of the Wednesday and have proceeded to the debate a lot before they fulfilled  the 24 hours.
Nevertheless, #some of *nosotros, like pertinent deputies of the Canarian islands, in addition to considering reasonable that  *prorrogue the force of this tax in accordance with the proposal presented by the Commission, have requested through amendments that affect to the most sensitive products, to #all the sensitive products produced in Canarians.
Projects of transport like the *road *to was for the relief of the networks of roads traditional require crafts of #all type like the *just *in *time *feeder and the ships of transport of containers, fast ferries and yachts of high speed, multipurpose ships for the fishing and *guardacostas, ships of luxury for the so much great tourism like small, etc.
From *Viana *do *Castelo until *Margueira and *Mitrena, happening by the dockyards of the districts of Port, *Aveiro and *Figueira gives *Foz; the workers demand a politics of valorisation of the naval sector, of defence of the stable employment, of quality and with #worthy wages and that promote the *aprovechamiento of the existent capacities.
To comprise the current situation, is necessary to remember that it is not  fulfilling the international agreement of 1994, relative to the elimination of the helps to the naval construction in the frame of the liberalisation of the sector.
It is necessary also that the Commission give priority to this problem and to his resolution, recognise the need to review ancient positions and facilitate to the European Parliament #all the informations on the damages caused to the #european naval industry.
Therefore, the Council has decided aptly that for the moment it did not goes to break the agreement to put end to the generic help of the industry of the naval construction from 1 January 2001.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen deputies, *yo also am #basque; I am a #basque woman; a socialist and #basque woman; #one more of the 92% of the citizens of the Basque Country that have voted in *Euskadi in favour of the Statute of Autonomy and that have voted by the democracy.
*Les Put another concrete example: #if, with occasion of a big championship, sell  tickets of access to the stadium only to the national citizens and  *deniega the possibility of *comprarlos to the no national citizens, to the other #european citizens, contravene  the norms of the competition and, therefore, here is necessary to act with rigour.
My task #would have resulted much simpler #if it had had the possibility to elaborate an authentic politics in the field of the sport on the base of an article of the Treaty.
#If we want to be represented like European Union in the field of the world-wide economy *globalizada and in the increasing *intervinculación political of the world is precise that endow at last to the European Union of juridical capacity, so that the representatives of the European Union also #can act in name of the Union.
And *yo #would give also an enormous dimension to *algo that hardly has been mentioned: we are taking a parallel exercise of *constitucionalización of the Treaties, with the preparation of a Letter of rights fundamental, to the time that poses  the Conference *Intergubernamental.
There #be a fundamental point to the that want *ceñirme in my intervention, *me refer to the comment of the Commission collected in his report for the summit that the conference *intergubernamental that is preparing  will be able to close with hit before the year 2000 #if the political will is it sufficiently strong.
So that it state in record, wanted to leave clear that, in accordance with our colleagues of the Green Group/European Free Alliance, in the Scottish Nationalist Party are engaged with the idea of a collective security in *Europa and receive with satisfaction the performance of the Council in this sense.
And we have to take advantage of this economic cycle and the statement that goes  to take on the #finnish Presidency concerning the #millenium and the new society of the information so that we #can register, with creativity, a growth sustained and so that the goal of the full employment was not rhetorical, but that materialise .
The proposal of resolution that have seen this morning did not contain any quotation of any relative initiative to the inner market neither to the society of the information, in spite of the works made under his Presidency.
To begin, regarding the subject of the employment, *nosotros consider it very important and have prepared it, as I already said in my intervention, with seen to that the first summit of the employment of the history, that will celebrate  under the #portuguese Presidency, was #all a hit.
I will mention so alone #one in the that *me seems that the European Union has to dump in depth: the constitution of the International Penal Court, that #would finish, gentleman President, with the situation in that now *nos find, in the that the international social demand did not corresponds  at all with the instruments *jurisdiccionales that are to our disposal.
We know that it will be a long and difficult path. Proof of *ello is the fault of debate in the Organisation of the Nations Joined of the resolution of the European Union on the moratorium to the capital executions.
The report in question, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, the first of this type, deserves #all type of praises and constitutes a *primer step to a politics of rights human in the that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament have to work of conjoint form.
Besides, the Commission of Control Budgetary wishes that it take  reference to the Agreement *interinstitucional of 6 May of this year and that indicate  that the quantities *indicativas for the period 2000-2002 form part of the financial frame *plurianual of the Program *Meda so that it remain clear that did not treats  of a new cost.
Have an only technical comment to the amendment 15 of the relative report to the economic cooperation in the that says  that the Council with qualified majority or the European Parliament #can decide the suspension of the collaboration.
*Yo Appreciate a lot the debate that has developed , as it has been an objective debate, a debate that has contributed observations very valuable and important, especially also for *Turquía, that will have to value also #which is the political climate in *Europa regarding his aspirations of adhesion to the European Union.
#This is a very important step and *yo even #would affirm that the fact that for the first time it define  a value limit for a substance *carcinógena, specifically for the *benceno, that #can cause leukaemia, marks a milestone in the field of the legislation on the quality of the air acclimatise.
We do not back this part of the amendment, since it has to have a reference to the community goal of 120*g/*km. The European Parliament has left sideways in his amendment the date in that it will have to fulfil  with this goal, is to say, the year 2010.
The Commission proposes another alternative, with the following text: "The Commission studies the possibility to establish a frame of reference for the fiscal measures that boost the use of tourisms of low consumption of fuel."
More that modify the regulation, it that takes the proposal is to assume an agreement of the Council of ministers; it is really an exception to the regulation, because *Portugal did not achieve to reach the quota that had awarded in the campaign 1997-1998 by some bad meteorological conditions, as they affirm.
Like this, we think that it is more correct to increase and improve the current system of calculation of the contingents, with parallel increases of the total sums of help to the production and no *orientarnos to a system of thresholds global that #can comport damages for #all the producers and no only for the that *rebasaron the contingents.
To5-0067/1999 of the Mrs. *Fraga *Estévez, in name of the Commission of Fishing, on the proposal of regulation of the Council (*COM(1999) 055 - *C4-0141/1999 - 1999/0047(*CNS)) by the that it establishes  the common organisation of markets in the sector of the products of the fishing and of the aquaculture.
In view of the fine current situation of the populations of herrings, the changes of the proposal admit a reduction of the area and of the temporary period of the restrictions of fishing.
The Parliament, the Commission and the Council have to issue a clear message for the industry *pesquera: the correct behaviour will respect , and the fishermen that observe the technical measures of conservation, elaborated by #european scientists accredited and by the own fishermen, will benefit  amply.
Lady Speaker, ladies, gentlemen, wanted colleagues, today *me congratulate to take use of the word for the first time in this Assembly, since I am new, and *me congratulate to take it on purpose of the fishing and of the excellent report of the Mrs. *Fraga *Estévez, because I am mayor of *Mèze, in *Hérault, in the south of *Francia, that is a small municipality, #one of the first ports of coastal fishing of the Mediterranean, near to *Sète, that constitutes the main port *pesquero.
. (*FR) Gentleman President, *Señorías, have followed with #all the attention that #can imagine the debates of yesterday, and the unanimity in the praises on the form and on the bottom of this report has not left of *preocuparme lightly, since it is impossible, further are *cuales are the qualities of commitment, content to #everyone at the same time.
It is a question of order, precisely to regret that the President no *me have conceded the use of the word in the moment in that the have asked, since I was the only deputy that yesterday announced that it went to propose this suspension.
Concerned, also, for reaching a learning without setbacks of the utilisation of the euro, the commission *EMAC has presented a proposal, that support, #tending to that the consumer #can begin to change his national coin in coins and notes issued in euros, from principles of the month of December of 2001.
But to freshen the memory of the colleagues, the proposal that has circulated in the Parliament treated on the *restablecimiento of the rights of the ancient real families of *Europa, in particular the of *Austria and #Italia, to the that  *les follows denying his civil rights and politicians like citizens of the European Union.
The call of the President #Clinton in favour of the introduction of norms of work in the commercial agreements with the countries in development and other parts of the world was the hit of grace that sentenced these conversations.
#If we admit this fact -that now, to a week of distance, *me seems shown-, results precisely that, *cuando decides , orients and controls the commercial liberalisation, is *cuando the countries in roads of development comprise the interest that represents for *ellos and surely consider that it is better for *ellos that a *statu *quo or the development of the bilateral relations that do not play to his favour.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Court of Accounts, ladies and gentlemen, have the intention to review the report of the Court of Accounts, sector by sector with the administrations and, especially, also with the States members, and analyse the question of why have produced  the errors.
*Permítame Take upsetting in #which is the paper of the Court of Accounts in this context: offer to the Parliament #all the material that estimate suitable and advisable present and leave to the Parliament the political decision to concede the approval of the management.
Also I want to say that in the Group of the Popular Party European and European Democrats my gratitude directs  to the president of the commission of culture, the Mr. *Gargani, that contributed amply to the positive result of the conciliation.
. (*FR) Congratulate and give the thanks to the speaker, Mr. #Niels *Busk, by the excellent report that has presented on the proposal of the relative Commission to the adoption in the community legislation of the plan of control of the Commission of *Pesquerías of the Atlantic Northeastern.
This proposal states therefore of a regulation and of a series of permissions, the designated permissions to full charge, and will offer for the first time the possibility to make a number *preestablecido of distances in #swiss territory with trucks of the European Union with a maximum weight of 40 tonnes.
It exists the real fear that #some of the very intentional amendments presented by the speaker in reality #can aggravate the situation; in particular, that *nos result more difficult to delete gradually all over the world, and especially in the nations developed, the harmful chlorofluorocarbons that are much more hurtful for the coat of ozone that the substances mentioned in this report.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the proposal of resolution (*B5-0313/1999), in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, on the *dictamen of the Parliament, in regard to the labeling of products alimentary produced from organisms modified genetically.
The #net result of this regulation, *cuando go in in vigour, will be that the big majority of the alimentary products of the supermarket will follow exactly the same that now -without labeling-, because the big majority of the alimentary products #can contain a small quantity of organisms genetically modified, underneath of the limit.
We want to help to *Turquía so that it undertake the path to the full respect of the criteria of *Copenhague and, now that the European Council *nos has given free road, will be able to establish the specific modalities of our help in the frame of a strategy of *preadhesión for this country.
With the end to induce to *Rusia to a political solution, the European Council issued a particular statement on the situation of *Chechenia and his consequences in the relations of the European Union with *Rusia.
The European Council underlined this look and considered necessary to follow loaning support to the human rights, to the State of Right and to the society of the citizens, #as well as continue with the relative projects to the nuclear security.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, first of all *yo wanted to manifest in name of the Group of the Popular Party European (*Democratacristianos)/European Democrats our sincere gratitude to the #finnish Presidency of the Council by the work made and by the fine disposal that has shown.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Commission, in the first place, my Group wants to express his recognition to the representatives of the #finnish Presidency because they have improved *ustedes in #a lot of fields the transparency and the expensive information to the European Parliament.
Now we owe *ocuparnos that the progress in the negotiations also was balanced and that it loan  the sufficient attention in the countries candidates to the social security, to the equality among men and women, to the labour questions and to the protection of the environment.
With reason, the Mr. *Poettering already has referred  to the three loose capes of *Amsterdam, that is a minimum package and, especially, to the fact that the taking of decisions by qualified majority continue being an important point of discussion in the Council.
It has reached  likewise an almost general agreement regarding the problem of *Chechenia and in the need of not using two weights and measures in our external politics, but to reaffirm the principles in the that it assent  the European Union.
*Europa #Can not be only #one *Europa of the oil companies, but that also has to be #one *Europa of the human rights. In this line, the Group of the Greens requests that it summon  a Conference on the *Cáucaso in collaboration with the *OSCE, that allow to contribute at last to the peace in the region.
The #Alto Curated for the Minorities has taken a good work, the *OSCE has mediated in *Belarús among the Government and the opposition, the *OSCE helps to find an exit to the problems in *Moldavia and boosts a greater reduction of the conventional arms.
Finally, it wanted to stand out, gentleman President, two points of the future #portuguese Presidency: the Summit on the employment, that *me seems important and #would have to have been object of greater analysis in this Parliament, and the priority conceded to the defence of the public health and the alimentary security.
#All have consciousness that the percentage of products audiovisual of #european origin that consume  in the #european space is very scarce, even considering jointly the values of the national production of each #one of the States members and of it that it is a #european production because it comport the collaboration of more of a Been member.
It wanted to ask to the Mr. Commissioner, since the Commission has supported with enthusiasm the candidature of *Turquía, #if these statements are compatible with the spirit with that the Council and the Commission proposed to declare to *Turquía like member candidate and #if #this constitutes a sample of the future behaviour of this country in this sense.
But already right now it wanted to *preguntarle: it is this program, in affirmative case, compatible with another position of the Commission according to the *cual have to protect  of the competition the audiovisual products Europeans, in particular in the sphere of the television, it that the French call "the cultural exception"?
The Commission has initiated takes little a horizontal investigation on the existent situation in #all the States members to observe the community problems and the that affect only to a determined Been member and, like this, tackle this problem of a more structural form.
Gentleman President, by it that have understood in the first part of the answer of the Mr. Commissioner, the Commission is totally indifferent in front of the consequences that involve the bridges shattered of the *Danubio and, of it only of it that occupies  is of how take use of this natural disaster -to the that *ella same has contributed- to overthrow to the leaders of *Yugoslavia, chosen legal and democratically.
#All the licences conceded to date in #Italia have allowed only the opening of four casinos (in front of the 119 of the Realm Joined and to the roughly 102 of *Alemania), #all *ellos situated in the North of #Italia, it that originates an evident discrimination in detriment of the regions of the goal 1, that #can obtain important benefits in terms of income by tourism and of economic expansion with the opening of venues of game.
In the report that will be smart at the end of the year will not appear still proposed, but that will analyse  in *él the repercussions of the system of distribution *exenta, that will go in in vigour at the end of 2000, and will appear in *él a complete analysis of the repercussions of the exemption by categories, that will constitute the base for back decisions.
I want to remember, in particular, the subject of the costs of trip of the civil servants in active service -a problem that also is precise to resolve with urgency- and other looks that to my mood to see already resolved neatly in the first reading and that now at last will be able to approve as it corresponds.
Gentleman President, suit with the strategy of the European Parliament in the first reading of the budget for the year 2000 and consider now that the European Parliament #can not, or do not has to, lose the face, under pity to lose also the credit.
The gentleman *Wynn *le has asked, lady Speaker in exercise, #if "by the moment" meant that the Council  *oponía to a review of the financial perspectives for the exercise 2000, it that *nos seems perfectly coherent with the commitment that is in roads to go out forward, or #if, "by the moment" means *algo more wander.
The President of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, exposed in the Summit of *Estambul of the *OSCE the political tasks for #all the region of the *Balcanes western and announced that the Commission is considering a contribution of the order of the 5.500 millions of euros like necessary support, specifically for the period 2000-2006.
In these conditions, suggest that at least *nosotros say, about the partial suspension of the program *TACIS in the budget of the year 2000, *algo entirely compatible with it that decided  in *Helsinki: first and mainly that, #if we want to save the *rúbrica of the democracy in the budget, also #would have to save the *rúbrica that applies  to the security of the nuclear projects.
The need of a constant follow-up and control of the execution of the projects, foreseen in the text, puts to covered the European Union of the flagrant attempts of fraud registered in the past and aims to the realisation of initiatives evident and, therefore, *comprobables.
In consequence, is precise to carry out the interventions to create a frame of security among, on the one hand, the New Independent States and, by #another, the European Union and his States members, so as to create some conditions of peace and of stability increasingly strong.
In his resolution, the European Parliament has #all the reason when affirming that the existent commitments do not suffice to limit the increase of the temperature to half grade in a century, but that, in addition to the existent, it is necessary to contract new commitments.
I want to answer to the Mr. *Pottering that has formulated a request to the principle of the session. The European Councils of Colony and of *Tampere created an organ commissioned to elaborate a Letter of Rights Fundamental.
. (*SV) Gentleman President, comprise really the interruption to deliver the prize to *Xanana *Gusmãor, that support totally, and wanted to, in name of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, ask #if it is not a discrimination to the women not continuing with the debate directly to the three, thing that *me had seemed quite normal.
Had account that the *concertación seems unavoidable, the Commission will exert a full and constructive paper to the hour to facilitate a commitment to avert the failure of the directive, it that *nos #would affect to #all and #would go in considerable detriment of the motorists that travel by the European Union.
From this point of sight, the deviations that have taken place regarding the biotechnologies, and that constituted a *cuestionamiento potential of the protocol on the biodiversity, are not acceptable by what did not correspond at all to the #european mandate and to the position adopted by the Parliament.
I have to say that I share the opinion issued in this text and according to the *cual the legislation in vigour in the breast of the European Union on this particularly controversial question is not to the height of the necessary protection and information of the consumers.

The Commission has centred his efforts in the establishment that the original decision to raise the embargo on the meat of *vacuno #british do not encloses any danger for the public health.

It has taken  a part of the path, but still treats  only of a part, as it shows it this rumour according to the *cual in the #british schools communicates  regularly to the parents that has not included  meat of bovine in the menu of the canteen.
Likewise it will be necessary that the Juridical Service and *yo determine #which is the suitable answer, in function of the answer of the #french authorities to the *dictamen motivated #whose sending approved  yesterday, because, fundamentally, is the juridical document by the that it establishes  the legal position and expect that the answer was in similar terms.
The instruments that the Council approved in the frame of the Section *IV of the Treaty on the European Union, before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, integrate  in the first stage of the harmonisation of the legislations and procedures in matter of immigration.
Besides, it wanted to remember that, nowadays, the application of the rule on the immigration of citizens of the aspiring countries or of third countries to the territory of the European Union is only competition of the authorities designated to national level by each #one of the States members.
*Me Ask #if the Council #would be had to recognise that the best mood to contain the flow of refugees economic raisin by the improvement of the economic conditions of his country of origin.
The Council expressed his worry by the problems originated by the delay of the flights, that are every time greater, and considered that there #be take measures to find solution to these problems and offer like this a better service in accordance with the requirements of the #european citizens.
The maximum sanction for a State that have signed the Agreement and deny  to fulfil the sentences of the Court is the complaint or the suspension of his participation in the organs of the Council of *Europa.

*Cuando The *dossier moved  of the Commission of Subjects Economic to the Commission of Industry, *me felt truly *aturdido. But the coordinator and the new speaker of the *EVP *me admitted in the Commission of Industry, compensating in a lot the previous embarrassment, by it that I want to express my gratitude to the two.
1) The Council agrees the following common orientation: the proposal of the Commission is acceptable without another modification that the addition of the article 37 to the letter *b) of the section 4 of the article 152 like juridical foundation;

In the commercial negotiations that still have not begun in *Seattle, in the that our competitors in the world-wide trade will have big interest in frustrating our efforts so that our sector *agropecuario and alimentary have a solid and competitive base, has to reflect  this fact.
Apart from the material reconstruction, our obstinacy is the to promote the civil society, the education on human rights and on the democracy and the exact conception of the justice. And we need the support of His *Señorías.
Report (To5-0095/1999) of the Gentlemen *Bourlanges and *Virrankoski, in name of the Commission of Budgets, on the project of budget general of the European Union for the exercise 2000, modified by the Council (#all the sections) (*C5-0600/1999) and on the notes *rectificativas *nº 1/2000 (11568/1999 - *C5-0313/1999) and 2/2000 (13482/1999 - *C5-0311/1999)
All #this is not very serious, and #would loan  even to prank #if, to #the same time, the budgetary politics of the Union and the danger of a review of the financial perspectives were not so contrary to the national interests.
Said of another way, this same week #can not  at the same time force to *Francia to raise the embargo, basing in #one *trazabilidad safe of the meat, and refuse the labeling, basing in the technical impossibility to follow the trace of the bovine animals.
Thus we have observed with satisfaction how the European Council has left clear that do not goes  to create a #european army, but that the efforts go to centre  in the prevention of conflicts and in the control of #crisis.
I create also that #this also contributes to the promotion of the #SME, #whose conservation supposes a very important look inside the European Union, and #this is it that is taking  here with an exemplary tarpaulin with the trade of the skilled book.
To take into account the evolution of the technologies, #would suit equally that the directive on the electronic trade included the requirements expressed by the different national legislations on the only price of the book, to prevent that it skew .
In the relation of the European Union and of his States members with the Republic of Indonesian only has, for now, felt keep the decisions of the Council of 16 September and 11 October, in the that they established  restrictions, among *ellas an embargo of the sale of arms.
Gentleman President, after eight years -as  *nos has remembered- of #one *cruenta civil war, the agreement of peace, signed on 7 July of this year, supposed the opportunity to close this tragic period and resolve of peaceful and durable way a conflict that has caused immense sufferings to the population.
In the concrete case of the #spanish citizen, *Nabil *Nanakli, gives  the circumstance, besides, that there #be not sufficient information on the trial, on the arrest and on the current situation of the *reo, thing that, besides, has *movilizado to #all the #muslim community.
Equally we pray to the spokesman of the National Assembly that take all it possible so that the subject go back  to examine and that take  justice to the women so that, until the next elections of the year 2003, the women of *Kuwait enjoy of political rights plenaries: it is to say of the right to vote and be voted.
Like member of parliament, therefore, take a call to my parliamentary colleagues to the of here and to the of our national parliaments also so that they invite to the #kuwaiti members of parliament to concede to the women the right of suffrage active and passive.
Therefore, the deputies of the Parliament have voted against, in #many of the cases, by fear to the own bases -do not exists there a structure of parties political, but that the deputies are chosen of direct form- and by fear to lose the own position.
We want to demand of the international community, especially of Nations Joined but also of the European Union and of his States members, that take part with #all the means to his scope to finish with the situation of discrimination extreme that suffers the #afghan woman.
The constitution of courts penal international, the *imprescriptibilidad of crimes against the Humanity, and the absence of submission of the politics of rights human to commercial interests of the State are principles and goals that consider essential.
It #can , obviously, question the means that the Mr. *Jarquín has employed for an absolutely lawful end, as it is the to investigate the corruption *galopante in *Nicaragua, corruption that reaches to the highest magistratures and, for example, to multiply almost by 1.000 the heritage of the President of the Republic.
Gentleman President, will talk of the natural catastrophes that affected south of *Francia in the night of the 12 to 13 November 1999, and that *revistieron an absolutely exceptional character by his violence and the abnormal proportions of the damages: 35 victims and among three and four *millardos of losses.
It is very regrettable that *nosotros, to scale #european, the institutions that organise the common agricultural politics, of the that depend the agriculturalists of the Union for his *sustento, are not able to obtain some reliable data in the that base an effective politics.
This last decision changes the obligations of the Commission, the *cuales were the result of the previous diet, is to say, of the annual help; the States members no longer have the need to concede helps to form groups of production.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0093/1999) of the Mr. *Savary, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council that modifies the Decision 97/787/*CE by the that concedes  exceptional financial assistance to *Armenia and #Georgia so as to *hacerla *extensiva to *Tayikistán (*COM(1999) 391  *C­0171/1999  1999/0172(*CNS))
To continuation some amendments that remit to the Council and to the Commission to his contradictions *diciéndoles that it #would be desirable to concede a direct help, but *financiándola in another line, think in *TACIS. Finally, some amendments of *condicionalidad: control of the employment of the bottoms, political and democratic conditions and control of the Parliament.
But #if they reestablish  the capacity *crediticia and the solvency of *Tayikistán #would be to celebrate also a proposal in the budget of the #2000.el speaker, Mr. *Bourlangues, *me finishes to confirm that it will foresee  in #the same a comment in the sense that in this case #can award  again a determined form of financial help in the frame of the program *TACIS.
To the equal that has taken it the Mr. *Blokland in his intervention, wanted to *decirle to the Commissioner Mrs. *Wallström -that removes the dream to the #italian pensioners, Greeks and Spaniards by the ancient vehicles that they have to be deleted quickly- that #would appreciate that it controlled  the destination of the helps conceded to *Tayikistán and to other States.
The *DG *XII had commissioned with anteriority a study on the investigation and the technological development in the insular regions and the *DG *XI had elaborated a code of fine behaviour for the management of the waste in the islands.
On the exact endowment of the regulation on the regional Bottoms Europeans, so important in this context, are still in course the negotiations with the European Parliament in the frame of the *concertación informal and of the legislative procedure.
I want to indicate besides that the Commission has communicated takes little that it is necessary to devote a special attention also to the inclusion of the insular regions in the measures of the community initiative *INTERREG *C. #This *me seems also reasonable, without that with *ello want to establish a trial advanced on the back procedure.
The Council gives the maximum importance to the electoral right to the European Parliament and in this context to the realisation of the principle reflected in the article 138 of the Treaty of the *CE of celebration of general and direct elections.
It has dictated  a sentence -and no by a small but by a wide majority, fifteen votes in favour and two against- in favour of the principle that, from the point of sight of the human rights, the citizens of *Gibraltar have to can vote in the #european elections.
#This is -at least, like this create it- the central core and the base for *resanar some institutions that #all without exception -#would be ridiculous that from the Parliament signalled with the finger exclusively to the Commission-, that #all without exception have won  an image -*me fear that in fine part justified-to be some institutions *entrometidas, *despilfarradoras and *improductivas.
I have known only in these days through the newspapers that, for having criticised said decision in the mixed commission European Parliament/Parliament *Esloveno, a deputy in exercise was object of an anomalous procedure in the parliamentary and democratic traditions.
In the report of the Commission of November of 1998 on the advances reached, *Polonia is described like a country with a social situation and stable politics that advances in the development of an economy of market effective.
The adaptation that requires the adhesion of these countries to the EU do not has to take place to coast of the most disadvantaged, in form of an increase of the unemployment and of the inequalities among the citizens, or of the discrimination of determined ethnic groups.
The system of exemptions by category that carries using the Commission from takes more of thirty years, today day no longer has the necessary flexibility to follow the rhythm of the fast transformations of the structures of distribution.
The Law protects the confidentiality of the communications written among an independent jurist and a company, so that it prevents that the Commission #can use #such documents like proof for the application of the #european rules on the competition.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam -*nos has remembered it the Mrs. *Hautala- has sanctioned this notion of transparency conceding to the citizens a true right of access to the documents of the Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission.
Regarding an analogous question, although distinct, the Commission shares the opinion of the lady speaker, according to the *cual the Defender of the Village has to have, inside it that fits, a wide access to the files and documents, in power of the Institutions, necessary for his investigations.
The consideration with the that it wanted to finish and to the that, personally, attribute the maximum importance, is that in the base of a fine relation among the citizens and the Institutions is precisely the transparency: a transparency in sense very wide that involves before that swims that the citizens are very informed about the rights that have.
In this context have adopted  also the amendments of the Commission of Budgets directed to harmonise the work of the Committee of tariffs *aduaneros common, so that an alone committee of general field #can occupy of the rates *arancelarias common.
My Group accepts also with pleasure the principle billed by the Mrs. *Schmidbauer that the users of the infrastructures have to pay the costs, included the environmental, #as well as the cost of other external factors taxes in the point of utilisation.
Besides, but it is not less important, the decision to launch military attacks, with the strengths determinants of the States Joined of *América, stresses the hegemony of #this and the *subalternidad political of the EU, that by this path never will have #one *PESC neither a common defence.
In these conditions, do not see how will be possible to avert the division of this province, which, after all, *nos will force to reconsider the most ancient solution of the world to reestablish the peace: trace a border among the villages.
*Me Have abstained to vote the common resolution on *Kosovo because from the principle have not shared the decision of intervention military of the NATO that consider an error and, besides, avoidable.
In *Rambouillet, in effect, to tenor of the statements of #some participants authorised, existed some favourable political conditions to other initiatives that, to my mood to see, were effective and that #would have been able to avert the death of *tantos innocent and the dramatic deportations of *cientos of thousands of #kosovar citizens, victims of the absurd nationalism of *Milosevic.
From this point of sight, any #european country is safe: it will suffice that it blow the wind so that the very fine dust of uranium was dragged to #Italia, *Alemania, *Hungría and to #all *Europa, with #the same effects of death caused in *Arabia #Saudi by the bellicose pollution caused in *Iraq during the war of the Gulf.
The fact to @atener  to this ancient conception of *Europa has had like consequence discourage, weaken and *marginar, in the SIN, to the leaders and pertinent managers of the dissident sectors, to the *reformadores, that fixed his look in *nosotros, and allow that the pertinent persons of totalitarian systems *recobraran prestige, of the that *Milosevic constitutes his archetype.
#If it was not because neither in the Council exists unanimity and with security, *me *atrevería to say, neither a big base of consensus, and even, do not exists at all understanding, the Council #can have coincided with the Commission and the decision #can have  adopted, although the Parliament had decided another thing.
Of this way, pretend to favour the trip of the traffic of commodities by road to other branches of the transport that are more sustainable, safer and save energy, whereas, besides, increases the possibility of election for the users of the transport.
As I have said, these matters tackle  from a point of sight horizontal, in a wider frame, in the field of other works that the Commission is making and, in consequence, #can not accept said amendments.
*Cuando The commercial exchanges or even the consumption *transfronterizo accelerate , see clearly that the financial services do not accompany this new reality or that even do not adapt  to #this, but that or well continue enclosed in his national and sectorial logic, or well seem to consider that this sector *reviste scarce interest.
The third observation is that, with regard to the decision *originaria to take build this tunnel to guarantee the traffic through the *Alpes, the enormous increase of the heavy traffic has converted it in a structure #whose dimensions have remained  rigorously narrow.
In relation with *Timor Oriental, the Commission shares the worry of the deputies to the European Parliament regarding the recent increase of the violence and, in this point, also *nos add to the statement effected by the Presidency the past 12 April.
Now, *Camboya. On this country want to say in brief that the troika of the EU has undertaken a diplomatic management with the Prime minister, the one who personally has declared to agree with the basic principle that the leaders of the *Khmeres reds owe sure enough *rendir accounts by the crimes committed.
The disciplinary measures proposals by the commission of follow-up, the administrative actions against the Realm Joined, is to say, in front of the #british Government, by the fault of appearance, up to now have not had effect.
Therefore I have hailed the value of the speaker, the *cual, in spite of the costs of infrastructure, underlines clearly the advantages of the rail alternative from the point of sight of the security and of the environment.
Part of the report on the program *DAPHNE contains information about the #european campaign allocated to improve the awareness about the question of the violence against the woman, that initiated  the month happened in Colony under the #german presidency.
These organisations need help precisely to the hour to create the distinct networks, to reach an effective diffusion of the information, to find associated and to boost a mutual exchange.
I believe that it is also very important expand gradually this program to the rest of the countries, especially to the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental, since the violence, in #all his modalities, has a dimension *transfronteriza, for example in his variant of trade sexual or of childish pornography through Internet.
Without embargo, the rights of the consumers, as #such and the relative politics to the consumers, in the measure in that it affects, for example, to the security of the foods and other, will follow being competition of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer.
Although the diets of pensions are of course distinct in each #one of the States members, believe that it #would be convenient to establish to scale of the European Union a level of subsidy minimum that each State #would have to guarantee to #that that #can not work or for the that it do not exists labour offer.
To the equal that the other #european citizens do not want to suffer fiscal damages *cuando decide to continue our professional activity after the entrance in vigour of our pension, and *eso no only in our country of origin, but also in the other States members of the Union.
With #this do not want to say that the report was not useful, but yes believe that it has remained  *atascado in the philosophy of the welfare. Besides, it do not answers at all to the title «The citizens of the third age in the Century *XXI: a life by in front».
Of entrance, it is necessary to know that, according to the estimates, the deficit *proteínico of the European Union *equivale to the 70 % of the inner consumption and represents, therefore, a big dependency of the European Union in front of the #american continent, of #where come from our imports.
By means of the program of the Diary 2000, the Commission will continue taking use of these instruments of management of market while they keep  the considerable differences that exist among the prices of the world-wide market and the of the inner market of the Union.
But it do not exists the risk that for the future of the sector of seeds *oleaginosas of the EU the remedy was worse that the illness? It is not to fear that because of the reduced help by hectare the agriculturalists opt by other crops?
*Nos Give account immediately that the state helps allocated to #Venecia are not the state helps allocated to any #another zone of the European Union: they serve to protect a heritage that is #ours, that have not created *nosotros and that have inherited, but that, precisely for having it inherited, have to transmit to the future generations.
As well, here I have to *hacerme spokesman of the resolution of the Commission of Regulation, that will incorporate  to this doctrine that, with proof and along the years, comes establishing, and is that this Parliament do not dissolves  and that this Parliament has to regulate, has to resolve on the problems that  *le pose from the *primer until the last day of his mandate.
It wanted to reassure it *diciéndole that the commission do not goes to remain absorbed in the Commission of Subjects Institutional: it goes to combine  with this commission to create a new Commission of Constitutional Subjects, that will be very important in this Assembly.
Of here that it want to express my gratitude to my colleagues and especially to the Mr. *Fayot by the very constructive cooperation that has kept  as a result of the modification of the Regulation and especially want *agradecerles the understanding and the positive predisposition that have shown to the opinions that have posed.
Said of another way, it is necessary to continue in the direction of the *policy-*mix with an evolution of the equivalent wages to the increases of the productivity with the object to favour the growth and the employment.
Finally, my wanted colleagues, it is necessary to continue with the liberalisation of the sectors of telecommunications, energy and transports, guarantee a better finance of the #SME and set up a reform of the fiscal and social systems, #as well as of the educational systems and of professional training.
Since the calls to the coordination of the fiscal systems -and alas in the paragraph 34 the speaker decants  thus- they finish for embezzling this second mechanism of adjust to the States members, *nos remains then the unemployment like instrument of regulation, or also the pressure on the wages.
But also it is true that a situation with types of stable interest, with stable prices, with types of low interest opens to the States members of the European Union a space of action considerably wider that up to now to delete the chronic unemployment.
*Ay #If a bureaucratic mentality had to throw to hammer it that, by the contrary, has to be a novelty: it treats  of a novelty from the point of sight institutional and also has to be it from the point of sight of the results!
Also by #this has felt the idea of the *OLAF, as the office is called to act in the global strategy of fight against the fraud and also will put to disposal his experience of face to the preparation of approaches preventive.
The European Council has stood out once again in *Viena that awards a big importance to the effective fight against the fraud, the corruption, and other activities that go in detriment of the financial interests of the European Union.
Lady Speaker, like relative question to the Regulation wanted to give to know #which is the sentence that said literally, owing to the attacks of the Mrs. *Roth-*Behrendt: «we #would have to renounce to a war of religion, so much transatlantic like European, in front of *dictámenes concrete and expect with tranquility a global vision of the science, before acting.»
*Cuando The *OMC examined our prohibition of the hormones -that, of course, existed a lot before it created  the *OMC-, got to the conclusion that the process by the that we had considered necessary said prohibition was not an evaluation of the risks that fulfilled the reasonably exigible criteria before applying a prohibition.
I #can ensure to His *Señorías that the possibility that the States Joined apply sanctions in relation with this question is much graver, by it that say that it is logical that take  public it before possible these conclusions is to act in *pro of the interests of the #european consumers, the #european citizens and the #european employment.
I #can ensure that the Commission, in virtue of these relations and on the base of the data that it has, will take a global assessment and will present, in his case, at the end of the period of experimentation, the corresponding proposals to give follow-up to the essay.
Like conclusion, for me, as *londinense, this weekend  *nos has taken to see very graphic and tragically the importance of the support to a *Europa of impartiality and justice for #all our citizens, the need that *nos engage in the fight against the intolerance, the racism and the hate, against these conceptions.
The resumption of the institutional dynamics, the establishment of these clear lines also is a need to give an opportunity to the enlargement of the European Union.
That *ustedes take  managers of it that today are saying in this Assembly in front of the public opinion European in favour of this #european Constitution, so that the citizens know his rights and his duties above the fights and of the interests of the States members.
Now it goes  to produce the relief and the Parliament has to ensure that before no *prorroguen the agreements with his friends neither treat to rise to some persons or to move to the employees of his own cabinets to the administration.
Perhaps #many of these things are surpassed at present. The problem to make a synthesis among these two elements will be #one of the greater political problems no only of the Commission, but of the Parliament and of the European Union in the next years.
The Group *Europa of the Nations wants to reestablish the growth in *Europa, in the first place, by means of the decrease of the compulsory exactions allocated to the structural Bottoms, to continuation by means of the lifting of the rigidities that characterise the management of the euro.
#If there had not been five independent experts, appointed by the Parliament, so that they express with total clarity his opinion on the operation of the Commission, #would follow having #the same Commission that #would not have resigned neither #would have been censored.
In this case in particular, seem to be that the conjoint attention of our speaker and of the Court of Accounts finds in the breast of the Foundation a real will to answer to the observations issued.
I was in Tyrant the days 21, 22 and 23 April and there warned the need that it felt  the presence of the European Parliament that no *me seems that to date it have organised an official presence in this region, thing that probably #would be timely to take.
*Yo #Would contribute two basic reflections: the first -that saves relation with the intervention of the President in exercise of the Council, the minister *Fischer- is that we are initiating a new stage that goes  to characterise by the nomination, by part of the Council, of the High Representative for the *PESC.
#If the Treaty establishes a mechanism, that is totally atypical in the sense that it is to the Parliament to the that *le corresponds the articulation of the text whereas the approval corresponds to the Council, do not change this balance also of *rondón and by the door of backwards.
Which results more unacceptable still #if it considers  that, *cuando adopt a decision to the *respecto in the session of December, approve a text very *ponderado and balanced. Of compliance with #the same, the diets of the #european deputies will be inferior in the future to the of the three States members more populated of the European Union.
And talking of promotions, precisely of this section 2 in that it talks  of *ellas, the Mr. *Filippi and *yo same go to present an amendment in the that, in addition to accepting the revaluation of 490 places, go to support also the permanent places and the temporary places that have accepted  already, #as well as the three promotions *ad *personam .
This midday, in a conversation with the Mr. *Prodi, have signalled that with the current planning of dates, foreseen by the Parliament for the nomination of the new Commission, or was to *crearla it but prompt around the middle of September, only will remain 14 days to present this notification *rectificativa.
This morning, in the first reading have gone back to collect with #all reason the procedure and have gone back to repeat in the *primer reading this point of sight of the Parliament of the first previous reading.
*Me #Would enjoy to take #some observations to this proposal. By a part am not satisfied with the way in that it has voted  the proposal in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and in the Commission of Protection of the Consumer.
We have to take upsetting especially the application of the principle of the information before the celebration of the agreement, so that the information offered provide a value added to the delivery of information already foreseen in the vertical directives.
Gentleman President, wanted to express my gratitude to the Presidency of the Council and especially to the Mrs. *Bonino and to his collaborators for having got to an agreement of form *tripartita that it was agreed by the Council and by the delegation of the Parliament.
So that they do not produce  problems of interpretation that *desfavorezcan to the consumer, in the result of the conciliation went back  to reiterate clearly, that the free creation of the contractual state of a commodity means, that the necessary costs, #such like costs of sending, of hand of drama and of material will run to charge of the seller.
The intention of the proposal was to create a harmonisation of minima of the legal disposals inside each Been member in particular on the need of guarantees legal, that already mentioned with #all eloquence the Mr. *Whitehead.
Besides, when establishing value limit more strict, will have to consider the available technology and especially the principle that have proposed for #all the measures on the environment and that has been recognised also by the Parliament, the principle of the relation of costs and of benefits.
But *yo believe that it treats  of important points, and -the Mrs. *Sandbæ*k already has mentioned it- the *plaguicidas in the foods of the babies was a point of controversy very strong, and in these cases treats  of the health of babies and small boys.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, the Mr. *Corbett no only has the merit to substitute of excellent form to the speaker but that also has detailed very explicitly the practical development and the advances in the procedures of *codecisión in the that it bases  this report.
Gentleman President, have received a letter of the services of the Cabinet of the President in the that  *me said that like the debate on *Kosovo went to celebrate  yesterday in the afternoon, did not go  to argue the questions that my gentlemen colleagues and *yo had presented for today in the afternoon to the Council.
It is to expect that the presidents of group obtain the backrest of the majority of the new Parliament that form  after 10 June to finish to clear and order the question of the *viáticos. As *nosotros still have not achieved it.
Like this, after forty-five years with a secret directory, inside a pair of months will be possible for the normal and common persons put in contact with the person of the Commission, for example, attendant of the delivery of the #telephone directories.
The European Council of Colony will have to save these omissions and seat the premises for the reform of the Commission, the enlargement of the vote by qualified majority and the *reponderación of the votes in the breast of the Council.
*Cuando Argue of institutional reforms, think also that it did not treats  only of figures but that the fault of strength of the Parliament regarding the cooperation with the Council and the Commission -*me refer here to the absence of procedure of *codecisión- plant  really in the agenda in this Conference.
The central elements are: majority vote like norm, new weighting of the votes in the Council, structural transformation of the Commission #as well as the right of the European Parliament to issue *dictámenes of compliance in #all the modifications of the Treaty.
Of compliance with the section 2 of the article 37 and of the section 5 of the article 40 of the Regulation, have received eight proposals of resolution on the European Council of Colony and the oral questions on the institutional reform.
The services of the Plenary *nos have informed that this conjoint debate on the Diary 2000 will initiate  with a statement of the Council and of the Commission and, to continuation, will take part the first orators of the Groups, no the speakers.
By means of the almost anticipation -go it to describe like this- of *Amsterdam, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have shown going out #one to the meeting of the other that it is possible to reach in a relation of tension positive resulted that they take to advance to the EU in his whole.
It did not proposes any serious strategy in favour of the employment, conforming with suggesting that it continue , pure and simply, #the same politics *macroeconómica monetarist that makes  from takes years, and that has not given proof of efficiency for *asentar a growth sustained and durable and to take that it reduce  the unemployment of form massive.
In the draft, the Council presents a series of proposals of statute, in the that appears reflected, for example, that the payment of the compensations will carry out by means of the presentation of *justificantes, in addition to diverse proposals more directed to establish the labour conditions of the assistants.
The Conservative Group and the *Socialdemócrata have put in danger today with his attitude the credibility of the European Parliament when refusing the proposal of the Liberal Group for a Statute of the deputies.
Regarding the commercialisation of the meats with hormones, in addition to the consequences that #can know in terms of disequilibriums of production in an agricultural activity *estructuralmente *excedentaria and very *fragilizada after the crisis of the *EEB, the consequences for the human health of the consumption of meat with hormones are far to be *desdeñables although they are known partially.
The World-wide Organisation of the Trade, #such as it has been negotiated by the Commission and imposed to the States members, tricks  of the principle of caution and sanitary security that each State has to can keep to preserve the security of his national.
Gentleman President, is by conviction and no by taste by the contradictions by it that will not vote the whole of resolutions legislative relative to the Inform Diary 2000, with exception of the relative to the *OCM of the wine, since we are against of the positions of the Commission and of the Council that result of the commitment of *Berlín.
It wanted to warn to any political Group that was thinking in playing to the politics *partidista with this vote, that the blockade of these proposals #would mean to have to expect until the new Parliament #can vote in autumn, and *ello #would take *peligrar more of 200.000 millions in resources and #would comport interminable delays for the communities and the local projects.
It was not easy the #exegesis of the approaches of the colleagues, but have found a formula that has allowed, with four amendments of transaction, achieve the majority withdrawal of other and, at the same time, keep the spirit of the proposal of our commission.
In the first place, the need to guarantee the existence of resources budgetary community sufficient to cover the needs of the sector in the frame of the structural politics *pesquera.
#One of *ellas -that saves relation with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam- is that in opinion of the speaker -that did not triumph in the Plenary, but that now, with the Treaty of *Amsterdam in vigour, purchases full sense- have to consider #all this process like a process of strategy conjoint of the Union that has to conduct to conjoint actions.
But in my opinion, the European Parliament has put  more in the place of the countries candidates to comprise how is it that mean the conditions of the European Union in the practice of the political life of said countries.
#This is a central point from the perspective of the Parliament. For *nosotros, also is important that the countries *beneficiarios use this instrument to know the rules and mechanisms of the structural politics and that, in this way, the back adhesion was easier.
The Council decided likewise separate of the original proposal of the Commission and increase the objective amount until the 9 %, instead of the 8 % proposed by the Commission, like coefficient of the bottom for the group of commitments pending of the Community.
*Me Allow to remember it that the Commissioner *Fischler said in an occasion: this political is so important because we always have to answer to the question of how #can take in the labour market the brother and the sister of a young agriculturalist that inherits the exploitation?
*Sintéticamente, #this #would be the basic points that carried to the Commission of Budgets to change the Monday at night his position of rejection to the Agreement *interinstitucional and propose to the Plenary that accept it, together with the financial perspectives *anejas.
We have supported #Galileo, the #european proposal in matter of global system of navigation, and have supported to the Commission of Transports in his wish to allocate the 55 % of the bottoms to the railways and a maximum of the 25 % to the roads.
I express my gratitude -no only in name of the Commission, but in a much wider plane, in name of the public in general of the Community and of the sector- by the forecast and the commitment shown by the Parliament in this subject.
#If tomorrow the Parliament did not get to the agreement to give his approval to an Agreement *Interinstitucional, will not have  then of the financial frame on the that have debated and on #whose base have agreed  both agreements: the *Quinto program mark of investigation and the networks *transeuropeas.
A last decision of the Council, to instances of the Parliament, has included #one *cuarta community initiative, the *cual also believe that it will benefit in looks very concrete to some populations determined of the European Union, although it do not have the community dimension that have the #others three initiatives.
Subject: safe Foods During the months of winter and spring are taking place, in #all the countries of the European Union, campaigns of national field around the subject of the security of the alimentary products and the health.
The capacity of export of the *Iraq is being at present increased with a *subprograma of the program «oil by foods», but because of the terms of planning and supply will apply  fully only from the spring of the 2000, #if well *ustedes know that the price of the oil supposes a factor of insecurity in both directions.
Also it #would wish that *me gave his opinion on #if in the case of *Iraq no  *infringe the treaty of *Viena, that forbids the starvation of citizens like form of war; it Considers that no  *infringe the Proclamation of the Human Rights and the Agreement on the Rights of the boys?
Gentleman representative of the Council, perhaps will have observed *usted that, in his communication of 23 March, the European Parliament takes for granted that in the new Commission there will be a considerably greater number of women that in the actuality.
By the contrary, fortunately, only in exceptional cases the administration of the Council has seen  promoted to proceed strictly against civil servants that have not respected the norms of behaviour professional in the exercise of his tasks.
We work exclusively in base to the experience that have accumulated in the Program of Peace and Reconciliation in *Irlanda of the North and also of #some programs of environment that have had #a lot of hit there and in the that the *ONG have taken the initiative and have received help with charge to the bottoms of the European Union.
It is not own of the Presidency take observations on the bottom of what has said; but I believe that yes it is it the *darle the thanks to *usted and to his Gentlemen colleagues of the #german Presidency because I believe that they always have shown respect and eagerness of collaboration and because they have had a presence really live in this Assembly.
Therefore, my political Group, the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left, will not give his support to a reform of the *PAC that will suppose, in fact, the deepening of his main disequilibriums.
Without embargo, my main objection against the employment of the article 203 is the following: we will take that the finance of the enlargement depend of the uncertain results of the annual budgetary conflicts among the Council and the European Parliament.
The Council and the Commission have declared  #willing, in relation with the calendar of ratification of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to recognise amply to the Parliament those rights that, especially in the capitulate of the structural reform, #can demand formally from 1 May of this year.
The villages of *Europa no *nos will concede any credibility #if on the one hand we say: we want to control a series of problems and take it having for *ello a series of bottoms, but on the other hand take to disappear this money in the pockets of some organisations and persons to those who do not corresponds.
It is evident that #if in *Europa there was some modulation among the richest zones and the poorest, the poorest #would not need, of course, this resource that calls  «rural development», idea enough wanders and quite bad endowed of bottoms, that, as we know #all, #can serve for #everything, as in a «#spanish inn».
It is an unlucky fact and, besides, the regulation takes impossible that #can go back to present this amendment, which means that we will not be able to obtain a nominal vote on the fact that the members are not  *ateniendo to the question of the transparency.
Without embargo, in my opinion, has not taken  reference to a circumstance, in concrete to that go to have to reinvent the economy of market #if we want that the villages of *Europa central and oriental, the new democracies of *Europa central and oriental reach *algún day the #status to convert  in members of the European Union.
Gentleman President, during five years have heard and learnt in the Commission of Budgets that the only possibility to prepare a good budget and take advantage of #all his possibilities consists in reaching an agreement *interinstitucional that guarantee the financial perspectives during seven years.
#If #any time has existed a recipe to reach a dissemination and a discrimination against the traditional local companies, able to increase the unemployment of way unnecessary, has been #this.
Now *nos find in a different stage: *nos find in front of a decision of the Commission and this report -lo and behold his importance- collects the *dictamen of the European Parliament that gets after #a lot of months of negotiation with the Commission and the Council.
It has to , as, congratulate to the social speakers for adding this new agreement on the agreements with a length determined to his previous agreement on the temporary work, and expect that they reach quickly a new agreement on the workers employed by means of agencies of temporary employment.
Of course, in addition to the goal of the commercial liberalisation, asked also that the agreement included guarantees for the environmental protection and the respect to the basic labour norms of the International Organisation of the Work.
And together with the progresses, also have to be conscious and recognise the difficulties that represents the inclusion in the field of the European Union of the Agreement of *Schengen, that is an enclosed world and that, besides, builds  to the *margen of the European Union to be able to work.
But of here to two or three years, the reality surely will surpass the forecasts, until #such point that, to be true the figures that stir  at present, in the year 2001 *ciento ten millions of #PC will be allocated to the use of the electronic trade, that will move #two hundred one thousand millions of dollars.
The fact that especially the *Länder Germans insist in withdrawing the similar services to the broadcast - as they formulate  here - of the field of application of the electronic trade, has his origin in the #german internal situation.
Nevertheless, *Señorías, this Parliament adopted two months ago an amendment to the article 5, section 1, that establishes that #that *cashing drops in the field of the directive on rights of author, is to say, in the judicial protection of the author, whereas the *cashing like #such do not involves an exploitation of the information transmitted.
This same morning also have requested that the President and the Table, that in this moment were not present, give green light so that in the next days a delegation of this Parliament displace  to Blunt so as to interview  with the Mr. *Rugova.
This morning we have had votes according to the new procedure of *Amsterdam, in the that have not been able to *quedarnos with #some isolated amendments like the amendment 28, that #would demand a clause of review of this perspective that extends  -as they already have said #some speakers this morning- along seven years without any review.
The birth of the only coin #can involve an aggravation of the disequilibriums among States because of the acceleration of the *deslocalizaciones, well to States or regions more competitive that #others, or well of regions that cross difficulties to the dominant economic axes that already outline  (the northwest of *Alemania, the *Benelux, Island of *Francia, the north of #Italia).
The debates on the Diary 2000 have lasted more of a year and have constituted the most important part of the works of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Parliament.
I #can not by less to say that the results of the Summit of *Berlín in the field of the reform of the common organisations of market in the sectors of the milk, the meat of *vacuno and the cereals no *me excite too much.
The Commission, that already *detenta a monopoly of the initiative,  *apropiaría like this of the executive power European, to convert  in the Government of the European Union, since the Council #would limit  to exert a paper of *segunda parliamentary house, that pronounces  by majority.
When listening the interventions of the deputies during the debate that has taken place in this hemicycle, #as well as the interventions of the President of the French Republic, *me surprises to check that the analysis of the errors limits  essentially to a *cuestionamiento personal of *Slobodan *Milosevic, of his family and of his gathered.
Regarding the next institutional reform, is very desirable that the voice of the Parliament have greater weight and that, *contrariamente to the ancient method, that had disappointed seriously, the reform centre  in a true dialogue *interinstitucional, which is perfectly expressed in the points 8 and 12 of our resolution.
It is important that the two legislative institutions of the Union issue a same *dictamen and, therefore, that the centre of gravity for the taking of decisions was situated in an equidistant point among the Council and the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, like our debate on the problems of actuality, urgency and special importance will treat amply the relative questions to the human rights, *yo #would wish to inform of a relatively grave fact that produced  in *Marruecos against a #french citizen, the Mrs. *Danze-*Serfaty.
I ask to the President of the European Parliament that direct  to the #moroccan authorities to protest against this expulsion of a #french citizen and to demand the right of #Abraham *Serfaty to return to his country.
#If it follows  killing to the leaders, #if the populations have to escape to the mountains and have fear to go to vote, #if the thousands of persons that were moved in the last year to *Timor, *proindonesios, have right to vote, #if leaders like *Xanana *Gusmãor follow prisoners, believe that it will not be possible to celebrate a free and just referendum for *Timor Oriental.
The Nations Joined, the European Union and the international community in general has to keep the pressure on Indonesian so that #this accept a military presence that guarantee the neutrality of the referendum and prevent that it convert  in a farce of unpredictable bloody consequences.
Gentleman President, *Timor Oriental is #one of the symbolic files in the that are in game the human rights and in the that the absence of rights of the villages and the absence of a true recognition of the right of self-determination conducts daily to a terrible drama.
On the other hand, gentleman President, this week have presented a question written in the that request the amnesty of 250 arrested persons in the #palestinian territory no *enjuiciados, but his service *me has communicated that the answer to this question will not have already place and neither his publication.
In the short term -as it affirms  also in the Statement of *Berlín-, the European Union follows concerned by the stagnation of the process of peace and to this *respecto is fundamental that after the elections in #Israel, the parts go back urgently to a whole application of the respective commitments subscribed in the Memorandum of *Wye *River.
I am the first deputy in the history of the European Parliament that has penetrated in the runners of the death, the past 21 April, fourteen days ago, for *reunirme with *Mumia *Abu #Jamal, political prisoner convict to death, in #whose favour often our Parliament has approved resolutions.
I will conclude this last speech, this last cry of the that they do not have voice, taking the signal of meeting of the blacks -are #many the blacks that today struggle in the States Joined against the pity of death, together with whites, Indians, *amerindios, Hispanics- and pronouncing the words: "*On *the *move!» .
Like conclusion, have to urge to the authorities *malasias to that they recognise that the development of a greater political cooperation and economic among the European Union and *Malasia will depend to a large extent that it initiate  a serious dialogue that end in the that in *Malasia give  steps for the observation of the fundamental human rights in said country.
#A lot of graces, gentleman *Vecchi, by his words, by the obstinacy with that has followed to the countries *ACP and by the obstinacy put in the breast of the commission that has followed #all the looks of the cooperation and of the development.
We #can entrust in that it find , sure enough -and it is indispensable that the Union contribute to *ello-, a solution that allow to stabilise the relations among the three islands -#if #this is possible, and anyway is it that wish- and that take into account the specific needs, particular, of the populations of each #one of these islands, that, although they do not find  very #move# away #one of #others, possess these specificities that finish to mention.
The military coup d'état that, obviously, condemn, produced  as a result of the grave incidents caused in Big *Comora by pertinent persons of the Island of *Anjouan, #as well as by the objective inability of the civil authorities to guarantee the process of reunification and of pacification of the State.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, this Assembly always has conceded special importance to the nuclear security, since #all know that in case that it produce  an accident in a nuclear head office, #this no only affects to the persons that work in *ella and that live in the *inmediaciones, but that prejudices to #all the inhabitants of *Europa. It is therefore by it that we have to watch of wall the norms of security.
It had wished that #all the that today they have presented a resolution, *me refer especially to the Group of the Popular Party European, *nos had backed more firmly in the past and that #all the that have signed the resolution that have in front had put more obstinacy in convincing to his *correligionarios.
Lady Speaker, in the decision of the Council of Agriculture have adjusted  the compensations by the discount of prices of the grain with the compensations in the crop of the industrial potatoes.
The Euro, like element of the development of the last years, of so big importance especially for the future, will have his place, and have achieved, by means of requests to the distinct commissions, can use the Euro like electronic money in the most different sectors.
To this disequilibrium it is necessary to add the multiplicity of agreements preferential, signed already or ready to be it, with third countries by part of the Union, just *cuando the announcement of a new cycle of negotiations *multilaterales puts in question the suitability of these bilateral agreements.
It is to say, that was considered a sector *marginal, condemned to disappear with an attitude *conformista and a fatalistic determinism that #would cause inevitably the unemployment of millions of workers, it that coincided with the moment chosen by the European Union for the fight *prioritaria against the unemployment.
Like this as, lady Speaker -and according to the #french Academy is perfectly correct-, #would wish *felicitarla no only for having been chosen now Speaker of our Assembly, for the next years, but also for being the first woman that after twenty years, as *usted already has said it, has *sucedido like Speaker to my ancient colleague, the Mrs. #Simone *Veil.
It #would wish also say to our #portuguese colleague, *Mário *Soares, that congratulate it for having taken part in this election, for having given to the Assembly the faculty to contest  the place, because in *eso consists the true political, the true democracy.
Lady Speaker, am here present for *rendir honours to the powers with that the Europeans have *revestido to this Parliament and to offer my sincere wishes of collaboration to build a better future for our citizens, but having present to #the same time that also are part of the world, the *cual is of #all.
This perception *relativizó the particular national interests and generated in #all *Europa the will to advance a decisive step in the historical task to complete the #european integration.
Finally, I see an enormous paradox in the election of yesterday by the right of this hemicycle of a candidate totally *estimable, but #whose federalism is shown, *cuando, in reality, at all is #that -*me seems to me- the message directed by the constituents -and, in particular, by the constituents of rights- in the #european countries.
It results very evident that said reform was and follow being a previous condition for the negotiations that go  to initiate in the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, that is -well that we see it- an instrument in hands of the dominant economy, is to say, of the #american economy.
Wish to the new Parliament it better and also to the next new Commission, a time happened the difficult audits -the Commissioners and Commissioners still for appointing in the house of torture of the European Parliament freely chosen-, it that say of course of an ironic mood and, of course, only *retóricamente.
Specifically, it #would want *darle the graces in name of the Commission of Politics Regional and, of course, of the socialist deputies, by the glorious work made during the period in the process of reform of the structural Bottoms.
#If in any moment *yo was not satisfied of how leave the things, will not doubt in using the powers that *me confers the Treaty until changing the competitions and the wallets, or in asking to each #one of the Commissioners his resignation.
I am convinced that the best way to reach this goal is to *través of the method that the Community already used with hit in the past: in the first place ask to the parts that cooperate among yes, that begin to work in common in questions of daily importance, that believe unions *aduaneras, that constitute common institutions and that affirm the peace through common interests.
I believe that #that's why the Commission refused, for example, take out of the budget, assigned by the program of reconstruction *OBNOVA, some 45 millions of euros, to pay the wages of the 700 persons that work for the Office of the High Representative for *Bosnia, it that *equivale to an amount of around 17 millions of euros of the 45 totals.
And in relation with the process of reforms of the absolutely necessary -Union, no only for the enlargement but to take a more democratic Union and more effective-, lady Speaker, think that, of course, it that #can not  take is a new Conference *intergubernamental to enclosed door.
It will reach  *recobrar the confidence #if there will be more transparency, but especially #if there will be a greater respect to the hour of *promulgar the directives, to the that they are the cultures and the national peculiarities, #as well as a greater and more frequent resource to the principle of subsidiariness.
*Les #Can ensure that it will be very important to keep a balance among the need of freedom of the trade, that is #one  the bases of *Europa, and the protection of the great rights, among the *cuales the right to the health is a fundamental right.
The security of the persons do not resides only in that there #be not war, but also in the economic stability, in the fulfillment of the human rights and in the protection offered by the states of Right.
The Parliament begins his work with a new squad and with new competitions conceded by the agreement of *Amsterdam, the previous Commission, that resigned in the middle of his term of office, has to be substituted and, finally, in the Council are preparing  for the renewal of the methods of work.
In consequence, while the European Parliament *focalice his attention only in the execution or no of the president *Öcalan, without tackling in depth the question of the self-determination of the villages, will penetrate in the surface of the problem, but never will achieve to resolve it.
Since we expect that *Turquía also #can be welcome in the breast of the European Union inside #some years, no only *le ask that it suspend the execution of the pity of death of *Öcalan but also that it commission  of the abolition of the pity of death in the country.
And *cuando there #be a neighbouring country and it same #would occur #if the problems, gentleman Commissioner, gave  in *Hungría and it was necessary to create *algo in the neighbour *Austria for the corresponding intervention the question is #if the *vecindad #can and has to be useful, and #if there #where there are problems the neighbouring countries #can really offer his experience on it that occurs in the region.
#Such as it will have known the Assembly by reports of press, in said document specify  some clear obligations for the future commissioners that propose  occupy *algún put during the back year to the termination of his mandate to inform with time to the Commission of his intentions.
I have been speaker in a considerable number of relative directives to the liberalisation of the sector of the telecommunications and so much *yo like my colleagues have acted of fine faith in this work and had taken for granted that the #ex Commissioner *Bangemann had taken it same.
Also it wanted to take advantage of this opportunity for, in a context *algo wider, *darles to know a brief outline of #some plans and projects directed, firstly, to situate this case in a greater context, and, second, that this case *nos give a reason for *reflexionar on it that we #would have to and have to improve in our legislation on edible for animals and foods.
#Ours *Europa will not work, the confidence in #ours *Europa will not work, #if we do not have the capacity to happen of this species of coordination of the control to a true *comunitarización of, at least, a part of these alimentary controls.
Because the citizens and the agriculturalists have right to expect of the Administration a suitable reaction in front of a crisis of this type, that maybe was not a natural phenomenon, but yes that  *acerca a lot to *ello #if we consider #which have been his effects.
I do not want to signal to nobody, but, with #all evidence, have jumped  preventive measures and have not taken into account the exhaustive controls that there #be in a so delicate field like the of the human alimentary chain.
More precisely, regarding the decisions taken, hail the reference to the employment and to the decision of a «#european pact in favour of the employment», *me see forced to express my dissatisfaction regarding the assignments released and to the concrete proposals presented.
The vote of this resolution is a signal *reveladora of the will of the European Parliament to clear #all the details of this subject and answer to the legitimate worries of the consumers.
In effect, have to foresee solutions in the short term to resolve the problems engendered by the pollution of the alimentary products in *Bélgica and, to longer term, has to initiate a debate on numerous questions already mentioned during the crisis of the crazy cows and that arise again because of this new alimentary crisis.
It was the *primer case in the community history in that it resorted  to the article 82 of the Treaty to penalise a discriminatory practice in damage of the interests of the consumers, but that did not have a significant effect on the market.
The fans to the football and the fans to other sports now will know, with #all reason, that have the protection of the law, and the organisers of the championships will know that  *les will impose an authentic and strong sanction #if they break the rule at present in vigour.
Along the almost #three hundred pages the experts rush forward without compassion against the problems related with the management, the mechanisms of control, the fight against the fraud, the politics of contracting of personnel and the business culture.
In this document #can read, for example, a criticism of bottom of the propensity of the Commission -like the of other administrations- to, quote: "act in his field according to his own logical, listening to determined *lobbies and without having sufficiently in account the consequences out of his field of competition" .
But the alone control of the European Parliament on the Commission will be insufficient by two reasons: firstly, because the European Parliament shares the goals of the Commission and, besides because #this is not subjected to the pressure of the public opinion.
The values that sustain the institution #would have to centre in an ethical of the fine management, in the assessment of the money, in a clear communication, in the merit and the service to the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union.
Without embargo, to the sight of this responsibility, that has been refused of *facto, results also difficult to take seriously the statements of the commissioners to obey in the future a request of resignation of the President of the Commission.
It is very interesting that the Committee of Experts affirm in the final warning that the administration of the Community tends to *privilegiar the tasks of the conception and of the negotiation in detriment of the tasks of management and of control.
And thus, the Socialist Group is had to contribute, from the institutional responsibility that has to have the Parliament, to a better operation of the community institutions, so much of the Parliament as of the Commission, and demand it to the Council.
Rather by fortune that by a fine planning even there #be not had a big accident that have resulted in a radioactive spill produced by a ship that transported radioactive materials, although it takes #some years sank  a ship that transported *hidrofluorido of uranium of *Francia to *Riga, although this registered that apparently they recovered  the containers without that produced  any spill.
The world is to a large extent a world of poverty, a world of AIDS, inside the that the *Europa that *esboza *usted is an island of welfare and of peace, based in the knowledge, that still follows being a far dream for #a lot of human beings.
Gentleman President, the vote of our Group, with the *cual deny the backrest to the Commission, is not fruit of a *animadversión to the persons, the members of the Commission, and the President, but fruit of the political assessment of the programs.
The Commission will be strong #if it will be able to fulfil fully his function of initiative in accordance with the Parliament that sues a greater participation in the preparation of the legislative proposals and an institutional relation constant with the Commission.
The answer is "at all" , because there #be not at all that it justify his program to control the political life of the nations of *Europa furtively, helped and induced by the Bosses of Government of the States members, without forgetting to the of the Realm Joined.
Regarding the measures of harmonisation that *le correspond, not even improve the situation in those countries in the that the legislation is more favourable for the hard-working classes and the disadvantaged categories or discriminated, mainly women and immigrant, since the harmonisation, *cuando the there #be, takes  by down.
#If we watch to the past, has taken  #a lot of upsetting in the collective responsibility. But when reading the report of the wise persons, the last report that finishes to appear, sees  that the practice has been very distinct.
On the auditions, agree with the Mr. *Corbett that it has been a good beginning, but there are things that have to improve *cuando go back to arise this subject in 2004, for example, the possibility that we make individual votes on each Commissioner, after a vote in commission or at least *indicativa to know #if the commission was really in favour or no.
The Mr. *Barnier finds  in an optimum position to comprise, apply and move the regional politics, given his political experience is his quality of minister national, but also like president of a regional assembly.
It #can that it was #that the moment to introduce those measures that the Committee of Experts Independent proposes, and that in the majority of the cases are measured of common sense that do not know why have not been already made.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the Bosses of State and of Government took takes almost a year the initiative to summon an extraordinary meeting of the European Council that was devoted fundamentally to the realisation of a space of freedom, of security and justice.
By decision of the Secretary and of the Spokesman of the Parliament of *Finlandia  *le has forbidden the entrance to the sessions of #the same, by indefinite time, to a reporter of television #finnish that took public some documents little *reveladores, provided by *algún deputy, on the *preparativos of the meeting of *Tampere.
The #finnish Presidency *nos has presented his proposals. Lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, to this *respecto wanted to call his attention on a point that consider fundamental in the frame of the debate on the realisation of the space of security, freedom and justice.
In part, treats  to build a *Europa strong, #whose need has been caused, #among others factors, by the own politics of the European Union; although mainly all turn around the fact that these parts of the judicial culture are the central nervous system of the democracies.
Lady Speaker, consider that in the resolution presented appear #all the assessments and the proposals that is timely that this Parliament approve to end to offer his immediate contribution so as to that the Council of *Tampere begin to fulfil specifically the solemn promises taken to the #european citizens by the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
It is important to struggle against the illegal immigration and against the abuse of the laws of asylum, but the governments have to respect the obligations that have contracted in the frame of the Agreement of Gin and give asylum to the true refugees, and *tratarles with compassion and with dignity, instead of *temerlos as to demons.
Finally, it wanted to express the wish that the debate that *ustedes go to celebrate today and morning with the Table of the Delegation of the European Parliament give fruit and that the dialogue among our two parliaments continue prompt in the frame of the Mixed Parliamentary Delegation.
It has not taken into account the paper of the European Parliament like representative of the #european villages, in virtue of the *cual the catalogue of rights fundamental #would have to emanate of our institution. By #everything *eso, #can not accept the function that  *nos attributes.
Those who conform  with little will say that at least *algo changes, but is important that *nosotros, the deputies to the European Parliament, are ambitious and keep opened the possibility to incorporate the Letter in the Treaties and in a #european common Constitution of the that even #can be the embryo.
In the Council of Subjects General of April of 1999 decide to ask to the Commission that prepare a program of performance economic and social to make possible the creation of the necessary institutions in *Timor Oriental.
The Union has demanded with firmness in #all moment that Indonesian take  manager of the order and of the security, but alas, as we already have seen, the authorities of this country have not fulfilled his obligations in this look.
Like European Parliament is our obligation talk with an alone voice *cuando are in game fundamental decisions for the future of *Europa. The resolution #would have collected even more support #if #one of the Groups had had to his disposal the translation in a language determined.
My conviction is the that *Europa will recover his letters of nobility in the opinion and the charm of #a lot of villages of the world when affirming clearly, in front of the breaker *neoliberal, his own values and his project.
This trial will base  in the measure in that this Commission approximate *Europa more to the village, confront  with the frauds and the inefficiency inside his own services, and, especially, arm to *Europa to face up to the offence, the unemployment and the social exclusion.
Gentleman President, a time that have seen that it foresaw  reassign #all the content of the *PRS 4 inside the category 4, in view of that the Parliament and the Council have decided to fund these credits in the title *B-1 Agriculture, *me go to allow *desviarme a bit because my problem are not the *PRS.
Because here the Commission *nos says literally that, although we already have taken this effort of finance with reallocation, is necessary an amount of 570,5 millions more, that the Commission proposes  reassign in the global transfer or in a complementary transfer in this exercise.
Any deputy of this Parliament that was not familiarised with the function of #Washington in the tragedies of Indonesian and of *Timor from 1966 until the last genocide *perpetrado by the soldiers on 30 August, #would have to read the analysis published today by the #Washington *Post and the *Herald *Tribune in first page: "The Pentagon says that the military contacts with Indonesian are useful" .
It is evident that it is necessary to exert international pressure on Indonesian and #many of *nosotros have asked that it suspend  already the financial assistance of the World-wide Bank and of the International Monetary Bottom and that suspend  the exports of arms and the military cooperation.
I do not believe that it was appropriate in #all the cases that the Europeans react in military plan in front of crisis that take place in zones very far of his borders, but the crisis of *Timor oriental has put of relief the difficulties with that trip the Europeans to answer to a new task of maintenance of the peace.
While we talk here, the Council of Security of the Nations Joined has approved a resolution with arrangement to the Chapter 7 of the Letter of the Nations Joined that allows that a strength of maintenance of the peace under #australian control go to *Timor oriental.
Perhaps we #would have to reconsider now this definition and promote an international debate to determine #if democracies like the #ours have to give equality of recognition, deal and *respetabilidad to diets of #everyone that *deniegan the democracy and the State of right, the human rights and the fine public management.
The main candidate of the Party *Socialdemócrata in the #european elections, #Pierre *Schori, affirmed also that exists a fundamental difference among it that the EU designates an effective management of the crises and a common defence.
In the conclusions of the European Council of Colony  *recalca that the creation of a #european politics of security and of defence presupposes the whole participation and in equal conditions of #all the States members, included the neutral militarily, in the operations of the European Union.
Although there #be #any request of word, have to apply the rules of the game, and in the article 4 of the annex *II of the Regulation says  that #all deputy will be able to formulate, in this turn of questions to the Council, only a complementary question.
Subject: Suppression of the use of lenses of contact of multiple use in experimental stage Determined reports of press appeared in June affirmed that, in Big *Bretaña, had recommended  to the optical suppress the use of the lenses of contact of multiple use in experimental stage by fear to that they #can transmit a new variant of the illness *Creutzfeldt-#Jakob.
Gentleman President, believe that the medical specialists and the optical know perfectly #which are the risks that #can cause the lenses of contact, but, as well we know, the Commission is the attendant to study the evolution of the situation in the practice.
But in spite of *eso, runs the voice that it #can get  to a deal; it is to say, the relative transitory periods to the free market of work and other similar subjects of the EU #can link to transitory periods in the countries candidates to the adhesion.
Obviously, it is a far country, but no thus it leaves to be true that the valid diet is literally criminal; the Union #would have to devote to demolish this diet; of it contrary, *nos will see forced, as in the case of *Kosovo or of other regions, to use the great means.
But in the case of *Corea of the North the problem resides in that the country is *herméticamente isolated of the rest of the societies of the world and, therefore, is *extremamente difficult take get the information to this country, #if well it #would be to wish that like this it occurred.
Gentleman President, as a result of the recent decision of the Council on the lifting of sanctions in relation with the crisis of *Kosovo, the Commission has presented the proposal to exonerate to *Kosovo and *Montenegro of the special sanctions of the *CE against the ancient Republic of *Yugoslavia.
It is comprehensible that today are debating the economic reconstruction of *Kosovo, that without embargo, is directly connected with political suitabilities of the States members, and also with the effort of these last for distributing the bottoms allocated to the reconstruction of *Kosovo among the companies of the States members.
And #this to say that it do not treats  of a question of research of a previous control on the character of the global help proposal, in spite of that the amount of #the same, 1.900 millions of euros in the next 5 years, like this #would advise it.
The European Union, that beyond all doubt has a main paper in the solution of the problems, has acted correctly when deciding extend the regulation, especially creating the service of reconstruction of the region.
It is clear that the mandate of the agency do not includes the assistance in the #others countries of the ancient *Yugoslavia neither in other #balkan countries, because this structure is the specific instrument of the European Union for the reconstruction of *Kosovo.
The disputes that *ocasionan delays are obviously inadmissible, had account of the need to find a fast solution to the problem and, therefore, the Commission is opened to an agreement of commitment that respect these goals of rapidity and efficiency.
Therefore, it wanted to ask: it #can transmit our wish to the Conference of Presidents that in the future, #if it goes back  to celebrate a debate in the that it exist a conflict with the Council, #this organise  of #such form that the Council was present and #can give a direct clash?
To concede to #both the opportunity of *recapacitar and to get to a better understanding of the subject and reach to continuation together with *nosotros a greater efficiency, request the return of the final vote to the Commission of Subjects External.
It More surprising of this manipulation is the attitude of the Council: during #all the negotiation of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, had resisted  *encarnizadamente to the *reagrupamientos, in a special title of the Treaty, of #all the rights of the citizens, *dispersos in said text.
Likewise, the program of supply of foods to *Rusia, launched this same year, is subject to a narrow surveillance that, among other things, includes controls of the utilisation of the bottoms generated by the sale of these alimentary products in the local markets.
The past November was in *Moscú with a group of the Parliament, that displaced  to that country to evaluate the need of help humanitarian, and #can check that the country simply is not in conditions to put order in his subjects.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, perhaps there #be a reason to remember that in *Rusia have occurred #a lot of things. More of 5000 nuclear heads have been taken out of circulation, In *Rusia have created  democratic institutions and #this possesses media that are able to criticise to the Government and have the value to take it.
Without embargo, to finish, estimated colleagues, wanted to take out to collation a question that also have posed #some of our colleagues, to know, the need to create a centre of investigation for the study investigation and systematic application of new methods of prevention of the earthquakes.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, estimated colleagues, the news of the Sunday happened about the convictions to death for the four persons that took part in the student disorders of the summer in will go created a wave of indignation and repudiate in the village *iraní and in the rest of the world.
To continuation, the preparation and application by a military commission joined that it has to be previous to the establishment of a strength of peace; and #this has to, to his time, occupy of the disarmament of #all the militias armed and to prepare the national reconciliation.
At present the journalists follow working in conditions no totally optimum; therefore I consider timely, for example, the transfer of the hall of press perhaps under the hemicycle, since the current hall continues being too much far and often is not easy for the journalists come to talk with the deputies, especially with occasion of important sessions.
This morning *les take the promise -*sobreentendiéndose that no *les #can promise it impossible: I #can not *prometerles that go to have of planes #all the days for *llevarles to his capitals and vice versa- that I will take all it that it #can, with the cooperation of the mayor and of the competent authorities, to improve of appreciable form the situation also in this look.
Gentleman President, in my *primer speech in front of this House *me had enjoyed to talk of the adjust electronic of the row of elevators to increase like this his efficiency, of the ventilation in the services, of the air conditioned and of the carpets totally *insulsas that there #be in the bar.
Also I regret the fault of monitors of TV in the zones of bars and restaurants that #would have to be to disposal of the deputies that take a pause to take coffee so that they #can follow the course of the debate and, #if they have to take part, so that they #can measure adequately his entrance in the Hemicycle.
Gentleman *Prodi, go to *citarle an example that *usted definitely will comprise very well: this principle has to be so important for the Union and has to have a so high priority like the that has, for example, the criterion of the stability of prices for the Central Bank European.
In spite of *ello, along the last diverse years States members have seen  forced to face up to odd forms of alimentary intoxication and hardly have of mechanisms of susceptible control to prevent that the industry of the foods introduce #all type of *desperdicios and waste in the alimentary chain.
I believe that *Europa has to assume the part of the responsibility that *le corresponds in this subject. It #would have to help economically to the small agriculturalists and to the other agricultural employers that have been victims of *algo that in some mood is not but a derailment of the #european agricultural politics.
Definitely, the debate celebrates  today, and since we are here and have heard to the gentleman President *Prodi, have been able to sure enough take in consideration it that *nos announces, is to say, the creation of an independent #european agency, the research with character *prioritario of the alimentary security, the reinforcement of the controls, etc.
These slimes contain heavy metals, #among others, considerable quantities of cadmium, and precisely thus in my country and in general in the #nordic countries this residue #can not disseminate by the arable surfaces, because the cadmium goes in in the alimentary chain and through #this in the persons.
Gentleman President, since it debated  two years ago the Green Book of the foods, expect that it conclude  the White Book, that will include, expect, the concrete initiatives and the responsibilities of the #european politics in the alimentary field.
In our opinion, the deep cause is that the social system puts the benefit by on even of the health of the persons. Especially *cuando treats  of the benefits of the great companies and of the health of the workers.
Lady Speaker, Commissioner *Prodi, Commissioner *Byrne, the crises of the *EEB and of the dioxin, together with the relative current controversy to the genetically modified foods, have combined  to undermine gravely the confidence of the consumers in the *inocuidad of the foods.
Gentleman President, at the beginning of the years eighty, *cuando the first alarming #news on the AIDS seeded the panic in *Europa and States Joined, the prognoses about the scope and the social implications of this illness purchased some catastrophic dimensions.
It treats  especially of young adults economically active that, in #a lot of cases, have to his charge to #all a family. Said of another mood, the AIDS affects mainly to a generation that in the majority of the countries constitutes the vertebral column of the society.
In the frame of the principle of caution sanitary, the European Union will have to therefore defend the application of this right to the compulsory licences in the Round of the #Millenium.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, with more of 2 millions of dead persons to the year and 4 millions of new infected in the #african continent, and with the certainty that the 70% of new *seropositivos registers  in the #african continent, how doubt fits that *nos find in front of a pandemia that is the first cause of death for the citizens of a #african country.
*Irlanda Of the North is in the periphery of this Union and is a peripheral part of the Union and, even so, are seeing the beginning of a terrible propagation in our country, related to a large extent with the traffic of drugs.
We #can not, especially because a series of States members have decided to break with the nuclear politics, with the politics of the fission, accept that the Union like #such continue funding the politics of the nuclear energy until four times more that #others.
Together with *ALTERNER and the investigation on renewable energy in the *Quinto Program Mark, that expect that it was very important, need the adoption of measures collateral urgent, #such as the directive on the access to the network for the market of the electricity.
The White Book *infundió hopes and are desirous that it set up the exciting campaign with his million of facilities photovoltaic, his big farm with aeolian energy, his biomass and -it more exciting of #all- his 100 communities in the that #all the electricity will proceed of renewable energy.
In the first place, *me seems that the available quantity is too much small and, second, #if we expect the duplication of the quantity of energy renewable, #would have to have a marked increase in the quantity of bottoms assigned for a period of #time.
It has a very scarce budget and, therefore same, our Group receives *favorablemente the proposal of the speaker to increase the resources of the program *SAVE in 4,4 millions of euros, until reaching a total of 68,4 millions of euros.
Regarding a last subject that  *me had remained in the inkwell, that is the participation of #some countries of the centre and east of *Europa, wanted to say that, in the actuality, there are ten countries that are benefiting  of programs *SAVE to incite to an improvement in the energetic efficiency.
Here it is the supplementary illustration of the collusion among the Commission and the Parliament for *desposeer to the #european Council of it that to my trial is of his exclusive competition, is to say, the external politics.
It was the fight of the #black masses the that imposed the end of the segregation institutionalised, but #this have not been able to unfortunately put end to the social segregation that takes that the workers and the unemployed of this country follow living in the misfortune.
Like this and #everything, the philosophy of bottom, *me seems the following: there are #some subjects that prejudice or go against of the competition and that, in consequence, have to be harmonised deeply; #others, instead, with regard to the *cuales the harmonisation, in my opinion, #would be hurtful, thing that do not occurs in the current States that even allow some diversity among his regions.
This figure, that includes to 350.000 refugees of *Croacia and *Bosnia-*Herzegovina, 120.000 displaced #serbian and #gipsy interns of *Kosovo and 300.000 unprotected socially, has been reckoned by the squad of evaluation conjoint for the alimentary help of the *ACNUR and of the World-wide Program of Foods, that visited the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia in July of this year.
The most unprotected groups of Serbian find  in these institutions, and the THROW wants to loan the support that was necessary in form of additional alimentary help -fundamentally the alimentary help will deliver  to *través of the World-wide Bank of Foods- and besides wants to complete it with other articles that are not foods and heating.
In the frame of this analysis, take in consideration the resolution of this Parliament of December of 1998, #as well as the conclusions of the Presidency of the Council after the two informal meetings of the ministers commissioned of the sport.
To me *me #would enjoy to ask to the Mrs. Commissioner #if, to achieve our goal, #would not be better *aunar #all our strengths and, with the backrest of #all the States members, present an only #european candidature like headquarters for this International Agency against the Doping.
I create, and I disagree a bit of *usted regarding the last part of his answer, that the important signals that gives the European Union in other regions of the world, but that are very near of the Indian, thanks to the organisation of events like the summits, have to be countered.
The #european employers, the #european political class, the #european public opinion, to the equal that the of the Indian, need an important signal, that #can not be another that a summit.
Further of #all #this, *yo wanted to add, without embargo, to finish that we follow considering necessary a deep reform in this field and the Commission has foreseen to present, therefore, before end of year a proposal to reform amply the system of subventions and of organisation of the markets in the sector of the linen and the hemp.
Now we are not in the #spanish Parliament, not even in the assembly of the region that has been mentioned, but in the European Parliament and #can not prejudge neither know in advance any criterion and respect the right of expression of the ladies and gentlemen deputies.
The main obstacle for the entry of *Turquía is his inability to fulfil the political criteria established in *Copenhague, especially regarding the democracy, the human rights and the rights of the minorities, in particular of the village *kurdo.
#If we advance in the proposal of the Commission and of the Council, #can *ustedes be safe that the diet of *Turquía do not goes to advance to the democratisation, will strengthen  in continuing and worsen the inadmissible politics, inhuman current that is developing #as well as the provocations against #Grecia and against the humanity.
Here it includes  for example the requirement to take  seriously no only *verbalmente the financial commitments of the European Union in front of *Turquía on the base of the financial protocol, but also the to put to disposal the corresponding bottoms.
The vicinity of the term to fulfil an intermediate stage of the process of peace, established for 4 May of the present year in the agreement of *Oslo, took that the situation went even more unsure.
The situation in Orient Next is still far of #this, but do not fits doubt that the election like prime minister of *Ehud #Barak in #Israel and the peaceful option of the Palestinians have offered an opportunity to the peace: they show it the recent progresses of the agreements of *Oslo in his version modified of *Sharm-the-*Sheikh.
The authentic difficulties will appear in the frame of the negotiations on the final situation, that includes the contentious subject of *Jerusalén, the control on the rights of the water and the return of the refugees.
Without embargo, this agreement has a considerable political significance: it marks the unblock of the process of peace, after the years of stagnation and even of deterioration during the government of *Netanyahu, that never had accepted the logic of *Oslo.
Lady Speaker, once again, with occasion of the vote on the calendar of periods partial of sessions for the year 2000, have had to face up to a round of amendments with seen to reduce the length of the partial periods of sessions in *Estrasburgo.
In effect, as it has remembered the Mr. *Dell' #Alba to the principle of the turn, with the participation in the votes, do not think to endorse a situation that in fact discriminates to millions of #european citizens, to #whose representatives  *les denies the full exercise of his parliamentary mandate.
In effect, had explains that the energetic saving on the consumption has improved up to now around the 1% annual, the European Commission *preconiza a supplementary reduction of a point of the percentage of saving on the final demand.
It is true that *Turquía #would have to, in this look, satisfy the criteria fixed by the European Council of *Copenhague, among the *cuales appear the existence of institutions stable that guarantee the democracy, the human rights and the respect to the minorities.
I do not go to vote in favour of the common resolution on the course of the relations European Union - *Turquía because in *ella there are reasonings and political contradictions, #as well as a fine dose of hypocrisy, things that are not own of a serious institution like our Parliament.
They debate  the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the opening of the Round of the #Millenium in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade of 30 November until 3 December in *Seattle.
These countries fear that the negotiation of the labour rights minima in the breast of the *OMC was an attempt to take part in his low labour costs and, therefore, in his relative advantage in this look.
These progresses have to allow reconcile the demographic growth and the economic growth with an endowment limited of natural resources, since it is the technical progress it that moves away the border of the durable utilisation of these resources.
Likewise, the hits obtained by the countries industrialised and the emergent economies of #Asia -because of the liberalisation of the exchanges-, have taken *tambalear the confidence of the communist diets and have conducted to his radical transformation in *Europa and #Asia.
Finally, the globalisation reflects the perceptions of the coming generations, the of the next century, that, through the media and of his own *peregrinar, live the world like a *aldea #where the *interdependencia promotes the solidarity and #where expresses  the taste by the difference and the confluence.
These norms refer , firstly, to the investment and to the competition, two questions in front of the *cuales our partners doubt, by very diverse reasons, and that, because of the precedent of the *AMI, arouse reservations and resistances by part of some countries in roads of development, *cuando no a radical hostility in #some of our no governmental organisations.
It is a very dangerous path, as they show it already the consequences of the application of the norms of the *OMC, with the aggravation of the social inequalities, of the unemployment and of the poverty in the world.
For example, still they have not seen the benefits for the textile sector and of the preparation, neither neither have seen any benefit of the liberalisation of the trade of products agricultural.
By the contrary, in the majority of the countries of the European Union, the concentration of the CO2 has not taken more that grow regarding the levels of 1990; therefore, they will need  drastic additional measures to fulfil with the agreements of *Kioto.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, it is necessary *agradecerles to *ustedes that they have coincided in the majority of the points with the resolution of the European Parliament, that collects neither more neither less that the philosophy of the European Parliament regarding the climatic change.
The intervention in the control of the crises is in accordance with the military neutrality of #some States members. In the conclusions of the meeting of Colony said  explicitly that the Union will not take part in the solutions adopted by the States members in matter of defence.
Gentleman President, the #finnish Presidency has prepared the enlargement of the qualified majority *enviándoles to the States members a questionnaire, in the that it asks  in how fields are had still to enable the qualified majority in the taking of decisions.
In the *primer paragraph of the article 29 of the statutes of the Central Bank European regulate  the criteria of the cast of the subscriptions of the capital of #the same, according to the *cuales the Bank of *Dinamarca #would have to contribute with a 1,6709 percent of the own capital of the #ECB.
On the other hand, the Council neither has received still any proposal to apply the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna (*ICCAT) against the overexploitation of this species.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, the Council has a positive attitude to the possibilities that offer  in the field of the fight against the social marginalisation contemplated in the paragraph 2 of the article 137 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, after the entrance in vigour of #the same.
Only it wanted to ask, in view of the problems of supply, #if the Commission goes to urge to #Georgia to that it build the 700 *m of road that are missing until the border *chechena, that did not build  owing to the #russian pressures, so that in the future the humanitarian help #can reach the border *chechena.
The Code has improved the mutual understanding about the politics of the States members, has established an effective mechanism of query and has boosted the dialogue about the application of his disposals.
Gentleman President, the fight against the pity of death in the world is first of all a fight of civilisation by this right of interference humanitarian that is opening  step in the world-wide consciousness.
We demand to the #indonesian Government that put end to the violence and that believes the necessary conditions so that, also *nosotros, from the European Union, #can help of suitable form to repair the damages and to loan the necessary humanitarian help.
It will be especially important #if this Parliament achieves to exert an appropriate political paper and concrete, so as to contribute to launch new light on this dark event and to take justice to the 81 victims and to his families that from takes more of 19 years are expecting to know that it occurred, why and #who are the managers.
In the European Union, the national authorities of the States members have to demand of the companies that inform to the apprentices and workers that #can remain exposed to the radiations, of the dangers for the health that comports his work and that *les qualify in the protection *radiológica.
In effect, the "right to contaminate" #can not buy, and a simple payment or an exchange #can not release to the richest to take #all the possible efforts to respect the common law.
Lady Speaker, for my Group this agreement *interinstitucional is another angular stone for the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union regarding the form to occupy  of the frauds and of the bad financial management.
The agreement *interinstitucional *nos carries even more far in another direction as it #would impose to #all the deputies and to the personnel the obligation to use the appropriate procedures to inform to the future services of *OLAF, so that #all complaint of fraud #can be investigated adequately.
I celebrate can contribute in my first oral intervention, like recent member of this High Assembly, to a fine part of the #european legislation and wish that produce  a wide compliance here and a fluent approval of the directive in the Council of Ministers.
I expect that in the vote that #be to make affirm  with strength the will of the Parliament to open immediately the path to this disposal that will allow immediately a greater visibility, a greater transparency and a greater access of the citizens to our democratic life.
In this point urges  to the Commission to that it go in in contact with third countries and with international organisations with a view to find suitable solutions To this *respecto it will be necessary to take into account of special way how proposed develop in this field the Commission of the Nations Joined for the International Mercantile Right (*CNUDMI), the *OCDE and the *OMC.
*Yo Celebrate can signal also in my first oral intervention in the Plenary of this Assembly that in my own homeland; *Austria, the facilities of transport by wire constitute an angular stone of the tourism and, therefore, of the national economy.
Therefore, *yo *me *congratulo that among the Parliament, the Council and the Commission exist an absolute consensus, an absolute coincidence, regarding the will to put to disposal the necessary credits for *Kosovo with charge to the Budget of the EU.
*Yo Believe that the #european taxpayers #would not comprise that they demanded  simply additional bottoms to fund the costs in *Kosovo, without visiting to #the same time the difficult path of the definition of priorities, or was, precisely, of a redistribution of the credits.
The *multifuncionalidad of the agriculture in the fields of the feeding, the conservation of the landscape, the protection of the nature and also of the tourism like sector of employment with perspectives of future, that surely will not contract  but that will follow growing, constitutes an important worry for #all the Parliament.
They manifested  numerous discrepancies: in the first place, regarding the *IFOP; second, regarding the support of the Council and of the States members to the Politics *Pesquera Common, especially regarding the international agreements of fishing, as in the recent case of the Agreement with *Marruecos; and, in *tercer place, on the relations of the EU with other international organisations.
Through measures of support directed specifically to the women in the frame of the politics of population and of development will be able to contribute to create a more social base stable, to the transformation of the existent structures and to the development of other new.
With the statements of the Mrs. *Schreyer in the sense that it will procure  redistribute the cost, resort in lower measure to the reservation of security and modify perhaps the Financial Perspectives, the Commission has given a *primer step of approximation to the positions of the Parliament.
The position of the Parliament is unanimous. We need a review limited of the Financial Perspectives so that no *nos see forced to go out of the step another time with a series of budgets complementary and *rectificativos, as it has occurred this year.
Second, regarding the external politics, specifically regarding *Kosovo, the audience that organise takes some days with the Commission of Subjects External and the Commission of Budgets to me *me resulted very *reveladora, especially the fact that #this was not a commitment in the short term.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0035/1999) of the Mr. *Huhne, in name of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary, on the annual report 1998 of the Central Bank European (*C4-0211/1999).
Like this, whereas the Treaty demands that the #ECB publish a quarterly report on his activities, the #ECB has decided to publish said report *mensualmente with the Monthly Bulletin, in the that it takes  an exhibition detailed of the economic and monetary evolution.
The publication by part of the #ECB of reports detailed of each country that takes part in the zone of the euro #would go against of the necessary creation of a perspective of #all the zone when developing, debate and think the monetary politics.
Therefore, an indispensable condition to achieve a substantial improvement in the processing of the payments to the by minor *transfronterizos is definitely that the banking sector establish some common characteristics for the processing among the banks.
*Yo Urge to the #ECB to that it contribute of constructive way to the hit of the Pact in favour of the growth and the employment, and that express with #all clarity how proposes  take part in the dialogue *macroeconómico to contribute to the definition of a combination of politics balanced.
#All the central or international banks of the great countries owe , in #one or another form, to this democratic responsibility in front of the socioeconomic community, in the #anglo-saxon countries to *través of the Parliament, in *Alemania through the Banks *federados of the *Länder.
Gentleman President, our Parliament receives in the day of today to the President of the Central Bank European, is to say, the president of the first institution to the *cual the #european nations - did not knows  why disorder - have decided to entrust, give a sovereign power, at least eleven of *ellas.
Without any doubt, *usted will have after all more can or influence that *ellos, although it was less brilliant, since in this end of #millenium that seems *erigir to the money like last universal value, is *usted *detentando the temporary power and the spiritual power in the breast of the European Union.
What greater was the equality in the level of the distribution of the information in the society, greater will be the efficiency with that individual options orient the development of the economy and the invisible hand of the market.
In the Low Countries made  a study of the economic institute of the small and medium enterprise, the *EIM, of the that definitely will agree . They have ascertained that the retail trade will have to have available a 100% of his volume of sales daily in coins of change, in front of the 7 % current.
Going back to the current situation, wanted to repeat that the strategy of politics monetary of the system of the Euro, that has presented  very clearly in front of the Parliament, bases  in two *pilares, both designed with a horizon of future on the half term.
Wish that know, gentleman President, that will give our support to #all the efforts that go directed to finish with the terrorist actions, to control the strengths *paramilitares and to sign the supremacy of the civil power on the military power.
We need to build a new nation in #where the respect of the human rights, the application of the justice and the reconstruction of our social tissue are the solid foundations that *nos allow to conform a society in the that the factors generators of violence eradicate  once and for all.
The Commission supports the clear affirmation of the importance of the prevention in the fight against the delinquency, already was financial, urban or juvenile, and sees recognised his management so that they stood out  in particular the rights of the victims of the criminal activities.
#If well it is true that #can have finished worse, #a lot of worse, especially for the citizens of the third countries that find  in *Europa or that aspire to come to *ella pushed by the need, #this did not removes that it has lost  a fine occasion to begin to build specifically a space of freedom, justice and security.
There #where the States members no longer #can go more far as they have got to the limit of his possibilities goes in in action the Union -in the politics of asylum, in the of migration, in the fight against the crime organised and in the cooperation with the justice.
On the immigration, believe that *Tampere represents an important stage, when integrating it that we #can call a strategy of *codesarrollo, is to say, when recognising that, to resolve the question of the immigration, it will be necessary to tackle fully the causes that originate the phenomenons of refugees.
Gentleman President, seat the bases of the creation of a #european space of freedom, security and justice was the goal of the European Council of *Tampere, an important goal because it affects to the fundamental values of our western civilisation.
It wanted to insist, in name of my Group, in that they apply  fully, in #all his looks, the principles of the Convention of Gin in the two slopes of the politics of migration, and that the Commission and the Parliament are entirely involved in #all the looks.
In *Tampere has produced  a mutation *cuasiconstitucional, because the Council has given a mandate to the Commission to establish, to #his proposal, common norms for the admission and the stay, for the lawsuits of small quantity, and for #many other questions.
The advances reached will be no only acts of the Council, of the Commission and of the European Parliament, but also of the States members in the measure in that  *les entrust some tasks of the bookmark in virtue of the principle of subsidiariness.
This proposal, combined with the maintenance of the monopoly of initiative of the Commission, *propiciaría, as we know, a considerable strengthening of the powers of this last and a correlated reduction of the right of the States.
It recognises -thing that *nosotros have said always- that the cooperations reinforced of the Treaty of *Amsterdam #can not serve at all to resolve the double program of the every time greater heterogeneity and the total impossibility to abandon powers of sovereignty to procedures of decision by qualified majority and, more still, in a *Europa of thirty States or more.
The social dimension of the European Union, a previous condition for a #european democracy, neither mentions  with an alone word in this report of the Council of the Wise persons.
After which will have still #a lot of work, among 10 November and the beginning of the negotiation, since the Commission will have to present a document of the that *yo same have said that it #would be a solid political document, global, structured so that it was useful to the negotiators and facilitate this negotiation.
Also it is true that our goal is it that before have called intelligent restructuring and there are three characteristic elements that #a lot of companies have taken into account; because in the past, in the European Union, have cases of the two forms of behaviour that have mentioned previously.
But #all know that, in this period, the alone legislation or the legislation in #if same #can not solve the *tremendo problem of the restructuring of the industry, especially *cuando the #european industry did not has to only compete inside the borders, but that it has to take part and face up with hit to the world-wide competition.
Finally, in #day of the start of the negotiations of the *OMC, wish to underline the need that *Europa affirm his political wills, also in matter of industrial politics, and plant in the centre of *ellas "the employment, the creation of wealth, the development of the territories".
By his part, my Group goes to direct  to the main #sindical organisations #european to exchange our experiences and, got the case, launch a #european request that allow to our *conciudadanos influence in the future decisions.
*Me Refer also to the thousands of workers of companies like *Michelin that have invested his time, his energies, his knowledges, his aptitudes, his hopes and his aspirations, in addition to the of his families, in the company in the that have worked during *tantos years.
In any case, #would want *asegurarles that the continuous communication with the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, and with the commission of the companies, will help continuously to the Commission to carry to good new term essential interventions and it more flexible possible in this sector.
Like this as, the European Union has regretted deeply that the Senate of States Joined, in his decision of 13 October, have refused the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs.
The Commission shares the disappointment that finishes to express the President of the Council in front of the rejection by part of the American Senate of the Treaty of prohibition total of the nuclear proofs.
Among the arguments adduced in the States Joined, #some considered that it had not got the moment to renounce the nuclear essays, *cuando results that *Corea of the North deploys efforts to endow  of his own arms and Chinese follows developing his arsenal.
It That *nosotros criticise deeply is this attitude of the republican majority in the Senate that answers more to it that it was *otrora the doctrine of the "self-evident destination" of the States Joined, much more that the of the moral leadership, in addition to the military, that have in this moment.
I hail the initiative of the President #Jacques *Chirac, of the Federal Chancellor #Gerhard *Schröder and of the Prime minister #Tony *Blair, those who have directed  in an open letter to the North American public opinion in *pro of a ratification of the Treaty *CTBT.
The European Union aptly is expanding the opportunities of the #russian companies to export to the markets of the European Union to promote the #russian economy.
In this sense, took  greater #granting and accepted  a minimum number of three States participants in the *coorganización of concrete projects and of five States participants in the agreements of cooperation cultural and of big *envergadura and procured  find the road of a greater *flexibilización of the devices of organisation.
There #be infinity of agents and cultural operators that will remain *desprovistos of #all class of means for the action that carry out, and #whose value is invaluable, #if it did not concludes  this file before the end of the common year to end to allow the entrance in vigour of the program already at the beginning of the next year.
The informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and with the Commission allow to expect that it get  here to a unification of criteria, as the youngsters and his associations expect that the performance and relation among the institutions was not bureaucratic but pragmatic.
In the session of the day 23 July, the President of the Parliament proposed to the commission that chair the examination of the bottom, and in the meeting of 27 July, the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media And Sport *me appointed speaker.
Nevertheless, since the bottom of this proposal " only" is to limit the period of helps of 5 to 3 years, there #be time to examine #if *Eurostat and the national institutes of statistical #can satisfy our needs of data and statistical informations.
As *usted will comprise, gentleman President, do not have intention to go in in the details of the amendments presented by the Parliament, but *me pleases *comunicarle that the Commission shares the interest to guarantee the hit of the small and medium enterprises, by it that accepts the relative amendment to #the same.
In the frame of the budgetary procedure, although we opt by a period of five years, the Parliament has #all the years the possibility to take modifications, to interrupt the payments, is to say, to sanction, #if it results necessary.
Lady Speaker, during the conclusion of my intervention in the debate of yesterday on the restructuring of the companies, signalled to the Vice-president that chaired the session that had produced  an anomaly in the conjoint resolution that go to vote later today.
Memory very well that in the Conference of Presidents -the colleagues that are here to my right definitely will agree , *Pat *Cox, the Mrs. *Hautala, my colleague Baron *Crespo and #others more- argue on the question of #if we talked of *Michelin or of the globalisation and the restructuring of the companies in general.
And *yo, therefore, ask to the Speaker that there #be a rigorous control in the register in relation with the no authorised modifications of the proposals, which is a problem, in my opinion, of modification and of falsity in public document of the Parliament.
There #be not form of *reintroducir, from the point of sight of the procedure, the amendment of the Mrs. *Scallon, since it do not exists any base of commitment to present an oral amendment.
Besides, in place to pose the political conditions that invariably posed the European Parliament, limits  to the quotation of the "Comments" to an institutional mechanism of control of doubtful effectiveness, as the experience with the program *Meda has come putting of self-evident.
It results particularly important that loan  special attention to the granting of any type of supports to these companies, that always have to be conditioned to the maintenance of the employment, and have to establish  severe sanctions and force to the return of the assignments, *cuando was not like this.
Every time that the European Parliament tackles #this and other questions, *me give account that it treats  of a field of action that requires measured to scale #european. It is the case of the railway and is the case of the transport of commodities dangerous.
Gentleman President, want, in the first place, appreciate to the Mr. *Hatzidakis, speaker and president of the Commission of Transports, Regional Politics and Tourism, the excellent report that has made on the proposal of modification of the Directive mark relative to the transport of commodities dangerous by railway.
It is true, as it says, that in #some zones of the network *nos find with a situation of overload, with some infrastructures that are already very used and very taken advantage of fundamentally in the transport of persons, that is the that in these moments has the priority in the politics of the railway in #all the States members.
And, to #that *respecto, #can not leave to underline the error that constituted, takes four or five years, the *concertación of an agreement of fishing out of the widest frame of the agreement of cooperation *concertado among the European Union and *Marruecos.
They have happened years and neither the Commissioner *Bonino neither the Commissioner *Fischler neither the respective ministers have had the diligence neither the necessary agility so that we were not debating here it that we have to take in front of a hurtful event, *cuando is missing a month so that it produce .
Far of *oponer among himself/hisself the interests of the workers of the sector *pesquero of the #european countries and of the #african countries, is necessary to look for a convergence concerning his claims and of his fight in front of the powerful capitalist interests.
But to #the same time have to get it before possible to a reasonable agreement that take into account the interests in matter of environment and external politics and of security and that do not commit the error to introduce demagogic elements that *desestabilicen to our neighbours. We have to avert that  *nos drop the bandage of the eyes *cuando was too much late, as *sucedió in the *Balcanes or in the *Cáucaso!
It treats  of: application of a plan of slaughterings selective; introduction of an identification of animal effective and of a system of register and of movements that already applies  completely; legislation for the elimination of meat and meat with bone of the factories of *piensos and of the agricultural establishments.
This House, through his Commission of Investigation on the *EEB, and the European Commission were the that recommended the measures that now are  applying to guarantee the security in #all the European Union of those who consume #british products and #british meat.
It is paramount that base our decisions in scientific proofs, and #if today the majority of the scientists thinks that it #can raise  the prohibition to export meat of bovine #british, expect that the #french authorities act inside #few days, and expect that the Commission undertake the pertinent legal actions, #if it do not occurs it expected.
This endemic persistence poses a fearsome question, the to know #if they do not exist other moods of transmission of the illness that the that detected up to now: the feeding with animal flours and the maternal transmission.
The charge of the sufficient scientific proof that weighs on the instance concerned for protecting the health of his population brakes or prevents in the practice the application of the principle of caution.
Gentleman President, after the excellent interventions of the Gentlemen *Souchet and *Martinez in favour of the maintenance of the #french embargo on the #british bovine meat, only wanted to add three reflections from the point of sight juridical, morals and politician.
Going back to the specific case, consider that the Parliament do not has to ask to the Commission that investigate the existence of recommendations formulated by the national Agencies managers of the alimentary security against of the community decisions.
I believe that the Commission is taking a good work, but our fundamental worry in this moment is the maintenance of the activity *pesquera and, in concrete, of an activity in the that there #be not *sobrexplotación, but conservation of the natural resources.
From *Marruecos *nos get #news that the #moroccan fishermen, with big despair, see the immense damage that takes  to his banks of fishes, so only to resupply to the #european markets of sardines and other common species of the that depend the same lives of *ellos and his families.
Therefore, gentleman Commissioner, in this question and in the that refers  to the agreements of fishing in general, as it put  of self-evident yesterday in the important debate that kept in relation with the Agreement of fishing with *Marruecos, always will have the favourable opinion, in general majority, of the Commission of Fishing, and expect that the follow having of this Parliament.
In the first reading of this concrete proposal the Parliament did not take amendments, but the speaker, #Hugh *McMahon in that moment, formulated the observation that it was absolutely essential that these three instruments went in in vigour to #the same time to avert any disadvantage in matter of competition.
I expect that the Council of Transports loan attention to this message and there are #some advances to reach that the transport by road remain comprised; of it contrary, see a real danger for the rail sector to consequence of the review of the general directive.
#If the speaker believed timely to propose that it postpone  said Agreement, the Commission of Subjects External #would support fully a proposal in this sense that, to the sight of the war of *Chechenia, *nos seems that it #would be a reasonable measure to take upsetting in this question.
Since the Popular Republic of Chinese has a chamber of the world-wide population and has a big economic potential, is very important his implication in the #european investigation and in the technological projects.
The technical backrest to favour the energy-efficiency, the saving of energy and the sources of energies clean and renewable will allow that Chinese reduce the broadcasts of CO2.
By it that refers  to the questions of biotechnology, have to answer to the Mr. *Gahrton that #all the proposals of investigation in the sphere of the biotechnologies have to satisfy *imperativamente the applicable ethical conditions to #all project of the program-mark.
Therefore, in this line and sharing the worries of the Parliament on the gravity of the situation in *Chechenia, neither create -and comprise perfectly the position of His *Señorías to #that *respecto- that this agreement was the best half to manifest our interests and our questions in front of it that is *sucediendo.
Since this year it celebrates the centenarian second of the trip of #Alexander *von *Humboldt to *Venezuela, *yo wanted to remember that *Humboldt no only contributed *algo, specifically the eagerness to know, but that also returned with *algo to *Europa, specifically with a knowledge on the tropical plants and on the geography of this interesting continent.
That, in spite of the practical more ecological that #can introduce #one or more States members, apply  it that appears in the directive of the most uniform form possible, and that do not exist an excess of bureaucracy for the manufacturers or for the points of sale in this context.
We are adherents that there are actions no legislative, as many times it is not necessary the legislation since, sometimes, suffices with the *soft *law, but these initiatives do not owe *hacernos lose of sight that it is necessary to avert a false idea of harmonisation, it is necessary to avert the juridical insecurity, #as well as the false expectations on the inner market.
The Parliament finds  in a fine position to set up the discussion on this type of initiatives. Especially, maybe, for giving to know the worries of the half citizen, to the one who, perhaps, no always listens  in the form owed in *Bruselas.
To avert #one overloads of the Court of Justice, which is comprehensible, the Commission has foreseen to leave in hands of the national judges the decision on the granting of exemptions in the frame of the section 3 of the article 85.
I do not want *detenerme in the juridical subjects that already have been perfectly tackled by the Mr. *Lehne and the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi; *me interests more *detenerme in #some political subjects that still do not tackle  of the all in the document, although it do not fits doubt that they will be object of debate in this Parliament, since, thanks to #the same, grows the idea of *Europa.
As well, the *primer strategic goal of the document that have presented and that are commenting here pretends precisely guarantee the balance among the inner market, by a part, and the defence of the interests of the consumer and of the environment, by #another.
We do not leave to escape this opportunity to reinforce the #european guidelines in matter of employment and to initiate to #the same time a process directed to the creation of places of work of quality and to a fine social protection.
This measure also takes in consideration the fact that in the operation of an inner market follow existing #a lot of social problems in the urban zones, #as well as in the rural zones of *Europa, and of course in my country, *Irlanda.
The local communities of the private sectors, public and of the volunteering #would have to can *aunar his collective talents in an effort for creating employment in the sector of the small and medium enterprises in his respective zones.
I consider positive, for example, the guidelines directed to the strengthening of the regional initiatives and venues of employment and the greater insistence in the *equiparación of the women in the politics of employment and to this *respecto believe that here it follows being valid the criticism of our colleague, the Mrs. *Theorin.
The correct reading, anyway, by part of the States members will have to be that the main part of the programs will not have to base in pertinent activities of the past, but in those #whose main goal was the acquisition of aptitudes creative.
The services develop  of two contrary moods: by a part have the conversion in services of #all the productive sectors, included the agricultural -that is not mentioned-, it that conducts to the abolition of the limits among *ellos, and, by #another, the industrialisation of the sector services.
In the field of the politics of employment and of the standards of the social model European, among the States members produces  a competition that do not favours the achievement of the goals that declare that we want to pursue and in the conditions that guarantee  in theory.
Of the debate that here keeps  from two hours ago believe that it derives  an optimistic conclusion, since it results patent that the European Parliament no only follows the problem with attention and thinks to the *respecto, but that, especially, takes proposed in a subject so *excepcionalmente delicate as it is the #european strategy for the employment.
Gentleman President, invoke our dignity of deputies because it is necessary to award to the signatures for the politics and the political statements, #the same dignity and #the same space that reserves  to the signatures for the assistances and the money.
They exist varied technologies to reduce simultaneously the broadcasts of particles and the broadcasts of oxides of nitrogen until the level demanded by *nosotros in the first reading well by means of the addition of *amoniaco, well by means of an intermediate refrigerator combined with a filter of regeneration.
Have a possibility to conclude with a solution of first class the successful history of the relative legislation to the broadcasts of gas for the improvement of the quality of the air.
The report of the Mrs. *Avilés on the common position has been approved also after a hard fight around the change of foundation juridical of the article 235 to the article 152 on the procedure of *codecisión.
Equally, in other reports on the world-wide conferences of the UN in the cooperation with third states , on #all with the states *ACP, have conceded a political priority very high to the needs of the boys
In the last debate that celebrate in this assembly on the case of the *Michelin, said that it is impossible to have restructurings of velvet, *velvet *changes, and #this is like this because we live a period in that the restructurings are *grandísimas; have the entrance of the technology, changes of the labour diet, there #be also a big enlargement of the phenomenon of the *mundialización.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, in occasion of the debate of 27 October happened on the subject *Michelin, remembered that the Parliament had amended the directive on the information and the query to the workers, and that expected that the Commission recovered these amendments.
It conducts to some terms of transition interminable in the environmental field for other states candidates, because of another mood, and quote it of the official document: "#this #would carry to an increase of the financial effort".
I share the point of sight -#such as I already underlined in my audition in front of this Parliament in September- that a reform of the system of finance has to have like goal a greater financial responsibility own of the Community.
When finishing, gentleman President, wanted to *puntualizar the fault of participation in the procedure of this report, because, except the Commission of Agriculture and #some of my colleagues that have helped in the amendments, #can not say that there #have been a big participation.
It Correct, instead, is to proceed to reexamine the line guideline before the first enlargement on the base of the real needs not to block a series of credits orientative with total uncertainty on his *adecuación *respecto so much to the total as to the calendar.
In the report asks  to the Commission that boost the optimum methods, the exchange of opinions and experiences, to increase the awareness of the population without thus leave to respect the principle of subsidiariness.
The imperative more decisive of the energetic and environmental politics, to the *acercarnos to the change of #millenium, is the to fulfil the commitments of *Kyoto and to #that *respecto, a tax on the CO2, #would exert, of course, an important paper.
By this reason, believe that the Report *Smet means an important step for the improvement of the situation of *cientos of thousands of workers and to avert that the length of the labour day convert  in a half illicit to increase the competitiveness.
To5-0060/1999 of the Mr. *Lechner, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, on the proposal of directive of the relative Council to the notification or transfer in the States members of judicial documents and *extrajudiciales in civil or mercantile matter [*COM(99) 219  *C­0044/1999  1999/0102(*CNS)];
By means of the new proposal of the Council for a regulation on the competition, recognition and execution of resolutions in familiar subjects and in the relative procedure to the parental responsibility, guarantees  now to the citizens and citizens of *Europa a unitary civil state.
In this sense only #can express my joy in front of the fact that every time there #be more countries -also countries members of the EU- that recognise the marriage among two persons of #the same sex and that comprise that #such couples #can wish have children and that #this is a wish that have right to see fulfilled.
#One of the conditions imposed to *Bulgaria for the opening of the negotiations of adhesion is specifically the fixation of a reasonable calendar for the closure of the unit 1-4 of the nuclear head office of *Kozloduy that it has to elaborate before it finalise the year 1999.
Second, in how felt exactly poses problems *Francia? And it #can the Commissioner confirm that to consequence of the problems posed by *Francia only there will be an explanation to the French and do not change #any in the plan of export #british according to a calendar established?
*Me Fear that the request to exclude to the #european companies of the application of this criminal law, by very useful that was this exception for the #european companies, in essence, do not solves the problem.
And I have to say that I did not have doubt that #that was his intention, because this Assembly knows the *curriculum of the Commissioner, in particular his step by *Hong *Kong, that *nos reveals an unambiguous commitment with the defence of the human rights and of a democratic system no limited so only to *Europa.
Afterwards I see the dimensions of our program in #Asia, that rises to some 350 millions of euros to the year, and *me *rasco the head thinking in how go to be able to loan the level of assistance necessary to the that it #can be #one of the greater and more important democracies of the world.
Subject: Protection of the interests of the community companies in *Kosovo The Organism of Telecommunications of #Grecia (*OTE) and the #italian company *STET *International, owners of the 49% of the *Srbija *Telekom, confront in *Kosovo threats and pressures of the *ELK and "#others", with the goal of *expulsarlas of the region, in violation of the international agreements of the two companies, only legal owners of rights of network in *Kosovo.
*Cuando The Council examine, at the end of this year, the results of the Common Action of 1997 in the fight against the violence that suffer the women, #would be the occasion to take the balance of the situation that His *Señoría finishes to describe.
The granting of helps distinct of the authorised that it has produced  along these years has allocated , especially, to fund the social field of the plan of restructuring, specifically complementary compensations to the employees sacked.
High gentleman Representative, have to mention that, personally, have struggled against the Council that *usted chairs more of two years, no with military means, but in the courts, to access to some document related with the fulfillment, by part of the States members, of the criteria that regulate the export of arms.
The European Union, with a common coin, a common market and a common legislation has a common interest in that #everything *ello translate  also in a politics of security and #worthy common defence of credit.
Before being able to express my satisfaction by this proposal, wish that delete  the ambiguity arisen as a result of the observations made by the minister of Defence #british, #Geoffrey *Hoon, to know, treats  of an army *francobritánico or of an army of the EU?
Although, in the Low Countries, #some want to exert the #british paper regarding the forced maintenance of the #atlantic relations, and *me refer to the previous #british paper, is not, without embargo, comparable with the questions concerning the *IESD that pose  in the States members of the neutral EU and without commitment.
And *permítame say to the Mr. *Patten that receive with satisfaction it that has said on armaments, but proposes  the Commission take a follow-up of his previous communications acting with determination in this field and agrees *conmigo in that the project meteoric Missile is of crucial importance for the future of the industry of defence #european?
*Nos Add to the demands of the #african countries of the south that ask not negotiating the fact that the vegetables and the animals or the human cells #can be patented subtracting wealth to the less favoured and taking greater the multinationals.
Report of the Mr. *Lechner (To5-0060/1999), in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the proposal of directive of the Council (*COM(1999) 219 - *C5-0044/1999 - 1999/0102(*CNS)) relative to the notification or transfer in the States members of judicial documents or *extrajudiciales in civil or mercantile matter
The European Commission, of course, analyses very thoroughly #all the plans of action in matter of employment that the States members of the EU present to the Parliament on an annual base, so as to guarantee that they support  integral measures and more modern in favour of the equality.
The Nordic Green Left (*NGL), composed by the #scandinavian members of the Group *GUE, has voted today in favour of the relative report to the notification of documents judicial in civil and mercantile matter.
I ask to #all the groups and members of parliament of this Assembly that involve  in this effort so that the different groups and political strengths take a new effort by the dialogue so as to that these processes of peace inside the Union have a positive end, as it seems that it is *sucediendo, fortunately and at last, in *Irlanda.
It is especially worrisome that the Government of *Rusia -in spite of his promises- have not begun to look for still a political solution to the crisis, but that follows *presionando only with military measures.
We were #many the that condemn in this Parliament the methods employed by the #russian army to crush under his fire #all possible resistance to his advance without taking in consideration the losses caused in the civil population.
I agree with that it informed to the Groups -and appreciate #a lot of have had the opportunity to talk of this subject with the Mr. *Ajmádov-, but in this House never had celebrated  up to now an official interview of this type.
Part of the motivation that hides  behind the Diary 2000 is the to fulfil, of credible way, with the regulation of the world-wide trade and of step, of course, convert to *Europa in a key speaker in the world-wide trade; *algo that will not want the Americans.
The members of the *OMC have to keep the possibility to concede priority in his politics to the public health, to the welfare of the animals, to the environmental protection and to the solidarity with the countries in development.
It wanted to urge also to the Commission and to the States members to that they look for a commitment *vinculante of the *OMC that allow to #all the pertinent exports of the less developed countries the free access of tariffs to the #european markets before the year 2003.
Also I defend a #red protectionism, in the that it aspire  to guarantee the rights of the workers and to prevent the use of methods unfair of work, as, for example, the utilisation of hand of childish drama.
To #the same time, #can not be that the world enrich  thanks to a new agreement of the *OMC, but that, simultaneously, impoverish  in the field of the culture and of the environment, or in the field of the agriculture and horticulture, and that lose in these terrains that have an essential value for *Europa.
Only I #can, then, take emphasis in that the negotiators of the European Union print his seal to the conversations, so that, to #the same time, consolidate  the current basic right of the International Organisation of Trade of face to the future.
The best guarantee for the security of the foods is the transparency of the alimentary chains and the existence of a clear assignment of the functions of control and of the *incumbencia of the responsibilities.
#This, without embargo, did not supposes that we created that #many of the inherent problems to the fundamental rights in Chinese are resolved or in roads of solution, neither that *callemos that, in the past, #the same States Joined adopted two weights and measures to the hour to demand the fulfillment of the social clause.
The defence of the traditions and specific shots of the own regions by means of restrictions to the politics of trade looms with undermining the bases of the exchange, of the development and of the divulging of knowledges, culture and welfare.
The Council of Ministers has to tackle simultaneously to the Conference *Intergubernamental an internal reform, #such as it requested  in the document *Trumpf-*Pires, and the core of #the same has to be the adoption of the vote by majority like norm and the *codecisión of this House, associated to #the same, in #all the legislative acts.
Without embargo, this enlargement of the number of actors in the #european stage will pose institutional problems and will generate appreciable operative weaknesses #if they do not adopt  opportunely the suitable measures and reforms  deeply the current system before the enlargement.
The #german diary "*Die *Welt" described yesterday like this the proposal: the classical defence of *Europa will follow being exclusive task of the NATO and the body of intervention of the EU will not compete with this last, but that it will be #one *baza more to his disposal.
Like this, we consider that the adoption of new federal powers in the level of the Union do not takes another thing that stress this disequilibrium and the moves away of the villages that the compose, as it is *sucediendo a bit in each #one of the reforms, as they show it the high taxes of abstention, in #all *Europa, in the #european elections.
The Governmental Conference will have to fulfil a very difficult calendar, since it is precise that complete his committed in the planned term for no *ocasionar any delay in the enlargement and, to #the same time, his committed is to prepare to the European Union for said enlargement, is to say, that is subject to some adjusted *márgenes temporary and confronts  with a big challenge.
We have to group, in interest of the transparency and the efficiency, the constitutional parts of the Treaty, included the regulation of the competition, and gather the remaining parts in another Treaty of category inferior.
As in the continuation of the question has mentioned  the *travesía rail of the *Pirineos among *Francia and *España, want to signal that, in fact, this rail link is not included, by the moment, in the network of communications to #european level, #such as #this understood  when being approved in 1996 by the Council and by the Parliament.
In consequence, to the sight of the concrete failure, checked of said political, the question is: we will follow funding this type of projects that in reality reinforce some totalitarian diets, some in fact criminal diets and *opresores of the human rights?
*Me Ask #if in the assessments that, as  *nos has said, is carrying out the Council, has included  also an assessment costs/benefits of it that cost to the #european taxpayers #all these actions of fight against the drug and how benefits are giving in the practice.
Gentleman President, wanted to consider positive the fact that they have taken  some management in front of *Turquía, but want to signal to #the same time my disappointment *cuando the restrictions imposed by *Turquía to the freedom of navigation commercial of #everyone, included the fleets *mercantes of the European Union are described simply of performances.
In effect, the purpose of the agreement consisted equally in finding a solution to the problem of the called *whistle *blower, #as well as to the following question: how it takes a civil servant *cuando has knowledge of the existence of a fraud or of indications of corruption, but by the reasons that was do not wants to take it know to his upper?
And #if, besides, I think that of compliance with this text the members of the Parliament are forced to collaborate with the activities of the *OLAF and are forced to *delatar to his colleagues, get to the conclusion that this attentive rule against the essence of the free mandate.
To reach a politics of this nature require  measures and #a lot of efforts to reach unanimity among the States members with regard to the need to have a politics of asylum human and generous.
But even with the small modifications approved in the European Parliament, included the minimum limit of age of 18 years and the limitation of the number of comparisons of digital prints to avert more possibilities of error, is unacceptable this proposal directed to create a *Europa fortress, closed to the #others citizen.
This organisation of the Nations Joined is the most indicated organ to solve the nuclear problems that arise in any part of the world.
On the other hand, it is precise to punish to the managers of the slaughterings and of the attempts against the humanity no only so that it take  justice in *Timor, but also so that, in fact, #that was an example that present in other parts of the world, #where, by misfortune, still exist and persist attacked against the dignity and, especially, against the life that, to our understand, is an inalienable right.
Gentleman President, although the situation in *Timor Oriental has taken another look thanks to the change of power in Indonesian and thanks to the arrival of the strength of peace, the conditions in the that find  the citizens of on foot in *Timor Oriental and the refugees in *Timor Western continue being very worrisome.
#All have seen the poignant images of the last *reo executed by the Court of *Florida and therefore no *les *extrañará to #any of the colleagues that the first person that appears in the text of the common resolution was the #spanish citizen -and therefore of the European Union- #Joaquín #José *Martínez, #whose conviction ask that it review  and #whose pity of death ask that it suspend .
Finally, it is necessary, as they have defended other colleagues, that the European Union and the Council impose the abolition of the pity of death by means of a special clause in the political and economic agreements with third countries.
The European Union, gentleman *Lamy, #would be had to represent a paper in this sense, to avert in the future this type of excesses, that are disastrous for the populations that wish the truth and the justice?
In the breast of the family is #where the boys learn the values of the "peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity" (Preamble), #as well as the necessary aptitudes to carry to the practice these values in the society during #all his life.
*Me Satisfies of joy can support the proposal of resolution that have today in front of *nosotros, that tends to achieve that these rights recognise : the rights of the progenitors to raise his children, and the rights of the children to this protection and to this support.
Of his work expect a lot regarding a greater knowledge of the phenomenon, of the existence of data and comparable informations and especially of the surveillance, the identification and the proposal of prohibition of dangerous substances planted in the market.
The own Commission of Juridical Subjects, that has occupied  of this subject, has adopted unanimously, repeat, unanimously, this position with the vote of #all the groups and after an examination detailed. As I already have said, it #would want that this measure cost for #all the offences.
I believe that we have advanced of form very substantial in the measure in that the European Bank of Investments has accepted that the *OLAF have #all the information and have of #everything it necessary to analyse the loans *bonificados with community bottoms, it that beyond all doubt has to be the fundamental object of our worry.
Gentleman President, after the approval of the amendment presented by the Mr. *Lisi, member of the Group of the Popular Party European, elect in the lists of Strength #Italia, express with greater satisfaction the explanation of my favourable vote to this measure.
The Mr. Newton *Dunn chose the *primer *pilar, *nosotros were of the opinion that we #would have to leave the procedure in the *tercer *pilar, because in #this the group of criminals that make fakes of passports is greater that in the first, #where the Mr. Newton *Dunn has included it, and #where concentrates  the persecution of the fake of documents exclusively on the illegal immigrants.
With *ello the Record of adhesion treated to keep in the measure of it possible the special statute that Canarian had had inside the #spanish State from his incorporation to the Crown of *Castilla in the century *XV.
As it will know the Mr. Commissioner, the week that comes celebrates  in *Bruselas a meeting of *partenariado in the that the Commission will argue with the Governments of *España, *Francia and *Portugal and with the Governments of the autonomous regions and the #european members of parliament of these regions the proposals to the *respecto.
Gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, from takes varied years come treating, first in the frame of the Commission of Subjects Economic and now in the of the Commission of Industry, the reports and the relative questions to the industry and to the naval construction.
It is *algo of it that has to talk  *cuando treat the question to have in *Europa a field of game equal for the sector; in fact, it that need is a field of game equal for the to scale international workers.
This sector, that #can seem, from a point of sight global, enough *marginal, exerts without embargo an essential paper in the balance of the economic and social tissue of our maritime coastal zones.
Without embargo, two years ago the European Commission froze the community help, and the of the States members, to the construction of new ships while they had not reached  the clear-cut goals in the plans of orientation *plurianuales of scrapping of fuselages.
I want to remember especially to the gentleman Commissioner that, in relation with the negotiations for our adhesion, the Union promised to loan attention to the far situation and to the climatic conditions of *Finlandia when taking decisions on the goals of the politics of navigation continental.
Like this they have affirmed it the civil servants of the General Direction *VII of the Commission, according to letter of #the same dated the 4.8.1999 when calling the attention on the fact that the help do not saves relation with the dockyards of the EU.
I believe that it is fundamental that the European Union exert a strong pressure to get to an agreement of *autolimitación of the production by part of *Corea, in addition to #everything it that already has said  concerning the norms allocated to avert this distortion of the competition.
But to judge by the current panorama, only #can *decirles that the majority of the Governments are acting against of the incorporation of a relative article to the sport in the Treaty. There are #some Governments that wish to advance in this direction.
As sporty, like #european citizen and like member of this Parliament wanted to, on the one hand, manifest very vigorously my disagreement with this proposal of the Council and, on the other hand, *preguntarle how measured thinks to take the Commission so that the sport have presupposed in the European Union and so that like this we #can work from here by the #european sport.
Obviously, the negotiations of adhesion will not be able to begin until *Turquía do not fulfil the political criteria of *Copenhague that put on purpose the accent in the human rights, the respect of the minorities and the religious freedom without limitations.
From a point of sight more general, wish to remember that the politics of security and defence requires the creation of a military industry to scale #european, able to compete with efficiency in the technological and financial plane.
These particular subjects form part of the important group of the agenda of the European Council of *Helsinki, and, as already it has indicated  here, this group conforms a dynamic #such, that, to succeed, the summit of *Helsinki will happen to the history.
I expect that the Speaker in exercise of the Council regret, as I take *yo, the *intromisión of the General Secretary of the NATO in the politics of the party, #whose logical repercussion is an attack to the politics of defence of *Finlandia and of other States members.
Without embargo, in a historical moment like #this, in the *cual or has  the value to give a big step advance or #if it do not runs  the risk to be condemned to a long impotence, consider that the audacity and the value explain more that the realism.
*Me #Would enjoy to underline that the editorial of the Letter of Rights Fundamental is a subject of the maximum importance. And will have to watch by that it do not remain  in a simple statement and convert  by the contrary in a text of character *vinculante.
I go to answer in an a bit distinct order to the of the interventions, but as I see that the Mr. *Harbour is still present, also *le will say that the Commission will present to the European Council of *Helsinki a wide initiative on the society of the information.
Finally, I want *comunicarles that the colleague #Chris *Patten, that regrets a lot not being able to be present today here because of a political commitment outside, has  to present, jointly with *Poul *Nielson and *conmigo same, a communication on the requirement of the respect of the human rights and of the democratisation in our external relations.
How it is possible to keep the pity of death and ask *ingresar in the European Union is *algo that do not leaves of *asombrarme; without embargo, it that *me surprises even more is that it talk  to concede this statute of candidate to the one who still has not abolished the pity of death.
Gentleman President, back the reports of the Mr. *Morillon relative to the actions directed to reach the economic and social development of *Turquía, #as well as to deepen the union *aduanera among the EU and this country; especially now, after the two earthquakes that has suffered *Turquía this year.
In a report of this year, the WHO get, besides, to the conclusion that the pollution of the air caused by the traffic of vehicles causes even more died that the accidents of circulation. The costs *macroeconómicos are also high.
We suggest a light modification of the text so that it adjust  to a standard terminology; it is to say: "Considering that the *benceno is an agent *cancerígeno *genotóxico for the humans and that do not exists an identifiable threshold underneath of the *cual do not comport any risk for the human health"
After having listened the interventions made in the course of the debate, the Commission thinks that the States members #would have to can request terms longer to fulfil the value limit of *benceno in those cases in that the term of 2010 #can involve serious socioeconomic problems.
This look already is contemplated among the requirements of notification general of the Directive 96/62 and the corresponding Decision of the Council 97/101 on the reciprocal exchange of information on the quality of the air.
I coincide with *él in that the planned term for the entrance in vigour of the directive #can not be on 1 January of the year 2000, but that it has to have an enlargement of at least three years to give time to the States members to adjust  to the directive.
It goes in , for example, the sector of the tourism in the concept of trade, in the *front-*loading, in the *predistribución , #if we think that precisely in the period of Christmas and New Year #a lot of citizens of our States members find  in tourist zones, in zones of practice of the sport of the ski?
This false opinion, that still finds  spread, due to the fact that the parity among the euro, the dollar and the yen, has followed, lamentably, a *derrotero different to the that seemed to show still the day 4 January, do not has to conduct to that impose  mistaken ideas on the value of the euro.
The conditions agreed in the international program of protection of the dolphins for the use of networks of siege of *jareta, that will apply  provisionally in group in the Community, determine that it incorporate  in this regulation a review of the size of the tights for two species of *pintarroja.
On the other hand, the fact that *yo was the representative of the greatest island of the Mediterranean -*Sicilia- and the president of the province of *Catania, in the *cual is very elevated the number of persons that devote  to the fishing, *me #would allow to contribute examples of daily experiences.
Report (To5-0065/1999) of the Mrs. *Breyer, in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the limits of *benceno and monoxide of carbon in the air acclimatise (*COM(1998)591 - *C4-0135/1999 - 1998/0333(*COD))
The fact to favour "the #european implantation of *Turquía", as it expressed it #Jacques *Chirac in *Estambul, on 18 November, recognising the statute of candidate to *Turquía, will be perceived by the #turkish authorities like a stimulus to continue with #the same politics.
Have the *sensatez of not changing this situation, gentleman President, and entrust in the means of payment modern, like the banking cards or the electronic wallet, to facilitate the life of the travellers and of those who live in border zones.
#If we examine by a moment this reason of bottom, believe that we have to recognise that the *OMC do not has to be already the one who supervise a negotiation of liberalisation among countries industrialised and that this situation has been modified of two forms: in the first place, no longer we #can *limitarnos to reduce the obstacles *arancelarios and no *arancelarios to the exchanges.
In truth, #if it do not appears this reference expresses, means that the agriculture will be treated like a normal economic activity, with it that they will be every time greater the pressures of our competitors to finish with #all the types of supports achieved. I underline it of "#all the types".
The *segunda thing that have seen -and believe that here neither #would owe *hacernos illusions-: the interest of the civil society, #such as it has manifested  in *Seattle, has not been merely an interest by the world-wide round, but also a demonstration against #everything it that do not likes to the persons.
In the Country of *Gales, of #where come from, receive important sums with charge to the structural Bottoms, but the line that separates the creation of a place of work and the *salvaguarda of a place of work is badly clear-cut and, therefore, *nos results difficult to evaluate it effective that have been said structural Bottoms.
In the next years will have to exert a fundamental paper regarding the examination of the financial frame and of the frame with seen to the enlargement, because it will be then *cuando see until where gives of himself/hisself *SOCRATES *II and his capacity to attend to the new European Union expanded.
Definitely, a badly formed person is not able to insert  in the society, in spite of #all his unseen or visible aptitudes, and think that it is a loss no only for the market of the employment but also for the society in general.
The proposal has two fundamental goals: on the one hand, the creation of a system of control and obligation of the parts *contratantes and on the other hand, the set up of a program allocated to boost the fulfillment of the norms of the *CPANE by the fuselages of third parts.
Gentleman President, this directive represents the *primer case in that the European Commission answers with a proposal to an appeal presented by the European Parliament in virtue of the power of initiative legislative indirect that *le awards the Treaty of *Maastricht.
It is an important and notable fact of face to the balance *interinstitucional because it shows that the Parliament #can find to an attentive and available speaker *cuando, with arrangement to the planned procedures in the Treaty, asks to the Commission that give follow-up to an initiative founded.
Gentleman President, two years after the negative result of the referendum in Swiss on his integration in the Economic Space European, the Council authorised to the Commission to negotiate bilateral agreements with that country in the fields that went necessary.
I declare my full compliance with the subject of bottom, is to say, with the method of calculation that proposes  to distribute the number of permissions among the different States members and that, in the circumstances mentioned, is the most objective, rigorous and *equitativo of the possible.
Gentleman President, the proposal of the Commission has by object deliver the 90% of the permissions to the States members that have the greater part of the circulation with Swiss and guarantee to #the same time a basic contingent for #all the States members of 1500 permissions to the year.
Sometimes it has  the impression of that, according to a determined way to understand the protection of the environment, the affirmation of principle, by not saying the concept, at the end is more important that the concrete result.
The Commission #can not accept the amendment 30, #whose goal is to expand the possibilities to concede exceptions in the case of substances that already have left to use .
The greater problems find  in the unsatisfactory internal situation, in the anomalies in the operation of the democratic system and in the rape of the human rights, included the rights of the minorities.
We need to clear varied things, #such as the paper of the members of the EU that are not it of the NATO in this strength and the paper of members of the NATO that are not it of the EU concerning this strength, #if they wish to take part.
*Me #One to the wish of the Prime minister, Mr. *Lipponen, that #if *Rusia exerted better in the future his quality of member of the world-wide community, #would take  possible carry out a cooperation *transfronteriza among the Union and *Rusia in the border north, and *ello #would confer *substancialidad to the #nordic dimension.
Gentleman President, in the presentation of the conclusions of *Helsinki, the President has formulated two propositions: a process of enlargement effective and #worthy of credit has to have continuity, and the countries candidates take part in equality of conditions in the process of adhesion.
The Commission has approved also a communication in the that formulate  the goals and the principles of politics audiovisual community to half term and formulates  a strategy for the call "was of the digital means".
The first proposal refers  to the materialisation of a program of training for the professionals of the #european industry of audiovisual programs, the called Half "program-Training", in the that appears a financial endowment of 50 millions of euros for the period 2001-2005.
Therefore, this bottom is simultaneously a bottom that has a component of emergency, but that, to #the same time, has like goal the to guarantee the finance of measures of structural politics of support to the received, the integration and the voluntary repatriation of refugees and *asilados.
Now well, I believe that the greater consumption of audiovisual products Europeans requires rather a pedagogy directed to the own Europeans, the stimulus to the taste and to the assessment of the #european culture and the rejection of *tantos products of bad quality that *nos get of other parts of the world.
In this directive is foreseen that the boys that  *reagrupan with a familiar that was permanent legal immigrant in the countries of the Union will have right to the total education in #the same conditions that the children of the citizens of the States members.
I #can *garantizarle that so much the General Direction of Justice and Subjects of Interior like the General Direction of Employment and Social Subjects have very clear consciousness that it is of strategic importance guarantee the access to the education of the boys of the legal immigrants in the countries of the Union.
Without embargo, in this context *yo *les #would pray that they take into account that perhaps it #would suit to procure establish some links among the competent services in matter of transport and the competent services in the field of the competition, so as to advance in the adoption of decisions of general character in matter of politics of transports in *Europa.
*Permítanme That *recapitule a moment to remember that said granting goes  to award, but still has not awarded , with the condition and the commitment that the pertinent income of the motorway will invest  in the tunnel of the base of the *Brénero, or was, in the railway.
In the committee of work on indicators of the quality and in the ministerial level examine  explanatory factors, like the plan of studies, the training of the professors, the resources, the evaluation and other.
To my trial the agenda of the Council of Ministers of Education of the past 26 November had been able to receive the proposal of a permanent committee on the quality of the education.
It do not considers the Commission that all #this constitutes a clear discrimination inside a same Been member and, besides, forces to the inhabitants that #would want to play in the regions of the centre and of the south to resort to other States members -exist *cientos of casinos in *Europa- before remaining  to play in the north of #Italia?
Subject: Price of the cars of tourism In front of the advertising of the subject, the Commission will have proof that the manufacturers of cars of tourism are earning much more in the Realm Joined that in other countries of the EU by identical cars.
#If *yo organised a round table with the industry -with the sellers and the manufacturers-, #would be *usted had to assist and examine with *ellos how #can find a form to finish with this problem, without thus leave to resort to the instruments in matter of competition, #if it do not remains more remedy?
Regarding the category 1 *B, estimate very timely the decision of the Council to accept the amendment of the Parliament to get to a politics of quality for the agricultural products Europeans.
My Group will support, besides, the rest of the amendments of the category 1 *B. Now that take place the negotiations of the *OMC, and *cuando #everyone talks that it carry out a fine rural politics, is important that the European Union exert an active politics in this field.
#If the problem has to  to the *inadecuación of the system of income of the European Union, it will be necessary to recognise the need to modify the system of finance of the European Union to solve it.
Specifically, it proposes  the nomination for the first time of the Mr. *Reynders of *Bélgica, the Mrs. *Geoghegan-*Quinn of *Irlanda, the Mr. *Caldeira of *Portugal and the Mr. *Fabra *Vallés of *España, and the nomination for a new mandate of the Gentlemen *Mohr of *Dinamarca, *Salmi of *Finlandia, #Clemente of #Italia and *Karlsson of *Suecia, quoted following the alphabetic order of the countries that the have designated.
*Eso Wants to say that it competes also to the Court of Accounts watch by that the protection of the financial interests of the Community take  from a *corpus *juris only and leave to take , as up to now, from legislation disperses, unconnected and contradictory, that treats the diverse attempts against the financial interests of the Community in accordance with the politics to the that refer  and no in accordance with principles *equitativos.
The possibility to suspend the action in the *nefasta hypothesis of explosion of a crisis is, definitely, a strong *disuasivo that will force to the New Independent States and *Mongolia to find a solution negotiated to the clashes and to *reducirlos to a dialectic normal politics.
The purpose to reach an agreement on some common norms is hit in the context of an economy *globalizada, but also from the point of sight of the global requirements in matter of protection of the environment.
In the debate on the adhesion to the Agreement of 1958, in the frame of the Report *Kittelmann elaborated in that moment, already kept a vehement discussion on until how point *ello put in *entredicho the political participation of the Parliament, specifically his right of *codecisión.
And it do not treats  only of questions so popular like the rise of the level of the sea and the disappearance of the small States *isleños or the flood of the lowest zones of *Bangladesh or of the Low Countries.
It is urgent, as, that now adopt  important measures to associate to these citizens to the takings of decision in the matter, to end of *responsabilizarlos in front of the phenomenon of the climatic change, by means of, for example, the instauration of wide advertising campaigns, that act on the behaviours of each #one.
Of here that *me *extrañe that nobody from then have taken quotation to this fact in the concrete proposals with the sight put in the fulfillment of the commitments of *Kioto and *me #would enjoy to ask to the Commission #if #this specifically forms part of the reflections of the Commission.
The *segunda: that, at last, in the field of the car, further of the norms that have approved, have of a strategy of renewal of the ancient park, a park that contaminates considerably more, in comparison with the park of vehicles recent.
The argument, according to the *cual the nuclear energy is not a sustainable method of production of energy owing to his waste and, therefore, #can not be included in the field of the mechanisms of development no *contaminante, is not an argument *defendible in no way.
They have to allocate more bottoms to the sources of energy alternative and announces  likewise that the utilisation of fuels solid and oil will give step to a greater utilisation of natural gas and renewable energies and to the generation of electricity in the future.
The European Union underlines this special identity of *Macao and considers important that conserve  the rights and the freedoms of his citizens in compliance with the conjoint Statement of Chinese and *Portugal, issued in 1987, and with the Constitution of the special autonomous region.
In our opinion are created the conditions so that they develop  the economic and cultural relations with a base of cooperation and mutual benefit among the Popular Republic of Chinese, in particular by means of *Macao, the European Union and his States members.
Report (To5-0084/1999) of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market, relative to the decision on the verification of the *credenciales after the *quinta direct election to the European Parliament, of the 10 to 13 June 1999
. (IN) The Commission considers that the common position is a pragmatic and efficient solution that solves satisfactorily the problems of the majority of the accidents in the that the two parts involved are #european, is to say, the that occur in the interior of the European Union.
Gentleman President, wanted to call the attention in the amendment 13 on an important difference among the #german text -that of course is the original text of the Mr. *Rothley- and the #english versions and believe that also the French.
The true solution resides no in the tolerance of a fault of information of the consumers, but in the greater efforts that make  to separate the products modified genetically of the conventional products, in #all the process of production.
A #european conference #can celebrate simultaneously to a meeting of the UN, only #if, by a part, endows  of a political #european intern and #if, on the other hand, shows a common determination in the frame of the dynamics of the UN.
The Commission of the Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities of this Parliament has explicitly included in his goals the follow-up and the realisation of the international agreements, #such as the Platform of Action of *Beijing.
The unanimous opinion of the Scientific Managerial Committee that there #be not need to review the decision to raise the embargo on the meat of *vacuno #british was enormously *tranquilizadora in this sense.
I support the call of the Mr. *von *Wogau, but also wanted to *referirme to the appeal of the Mr. *Goepel, because it has taken a constitutional suggestion very interesting, to know, that the representative of the Council take part in connection with the Report *Papayannakis.
*Cuando The French Agency of Health and Security in the Foods challenged this decision, *algo that was in his right to take, *me imagine that in terms of his own competition, the case was put in hands of the Scientific Committee, that backed by unanimity the security of the meat of *vacuno #british.
Regarding the referendum, the Council, instead, has taken note of the report of the General Secretary of the Nations Joined that it remits  to the need of *reflexionar thoroughly on the possible consequences that #can have this subject, also the related with the date of the referendum.
Gentleman President, the European Union has not taken part on purpose in the treatment of this subject, but, without embargo, studies the means to contribute of constructive form to the advance of the process of peace in the region of the *Sáhara Western.
In this context, the #finnish Presidency confirmed that the European Union considers important the fulfillment of the four Agreements of Gin and of the two complementary Protocols, that constitute the fundamental treaties of the international humanitarian Right.
By a *desencuentro among the Groups of this Assembly -believe that more of formality that by disagreement on the bottom of the proposal-, did not include  #this for the debate, but will insist in next Plenaries in attention to the importance of the subject, very highlighted by the answer of the representative of the Council.
It has foreseen to influence the Council so that, when reforming the procedures of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the own Court adopt the principle of advertising and give greater transparency to the process of taking of decisions?
Although -for example, in the Realm Joined- exists the legal right to impose interests to the payments delayed, there #be not practically forms to achieve his materialisation and the judicial actions are not practical to recover small debts.
We propose a maximum term of eight months. And with amendments, of course, approved by the Commission of Environment, gentleman President, substantially coincide also *nosotros with the proposals to leave to a side the *codecisión, so that we do not lose time and the forcing was a reality it before possible.
Without pretending minimise the gravity of the situation, the repercussions in the confidence of the consumers have been a lot greater, in my opinion, that the real threat to the public health.
It That do not has explanation is that #all the States members of the European Union matter dairy products with *BST -the pertinent majority of the *EEUU, the Czech Republic, *Eslovaquia or *Bulgaria- that get to the table of our consumers from takes long, for example the cheeses elaborated with milk obtained by means of this technician.
His compatriots, the international opinion, know that his conviction was solid, when declaring to his exit of the prison: "Like free man, *me engage to take all it that was in my power to bring the peace to *Timor Oriental and to my village".
The community budgets for the year 2000 approved today in the European Parliament are an important step in the correct direction, is to say, so that the EU assume an every time greater responsibility by his citizens.
(*FI) Consider reasonable that attend  the next year to the relative financial needs to the crisis of *Kosovo by means of the use of the flexibility in general. Regarding the Chapter 4, has not proceeded  still to the review of the financial perspectives.
The book is a very cultural, the writing is the first form of fixation of the language, of identification of the language. And I create, even being important the fulfillment of the norms of the competition, that the cultural look of the subject has to consider of equal importance and rank.
Why the Commission #would not collect our proposal to extend the possibility to apply the system of the only price of the book to the group of the States members?
I want likewise ensure to #all the participants in the debate that, to the equal that *ustedes, the Commission and *yo attribute #a lot of importance to the culture, to the book, recognise the cultural importance of the book and are had to take into account these specificities.
By this reason, the EU #would have to *prorrogar his embargo of sale of arms to Indonesian, that already hard four years, as #if we had to raise said embargo of armament, the message that #would send to the soldiers #would be, undoubtedly, that accepts  his performance and  the recognise, whereas, as I finish to signal, *eso is far to be the case.
We have to command a clear message to the #indonesian authorities in the sense that we do not go to accept by more time his contempt by the wishes of respect of the human rights and of peace of the international community.
Gentleman President, sure enough, once again the European Parliament has to pronounce against of the pity of death, against of the greater rape of the human rights that follows  committing in the world, many times and for our collective shame, to the protect of laws that have elaborated men that represent the popular sovereignty.
Therefore I want to call the attention on the point 5 of our Resolution, that says that we reiterate our appeal to the Council that it incorporate in the negotiations with third countries -with #all- "the abolition of the pity of death like clause of respect of the human rights" .
Gentleman President, for a Christian the request of moratorium to the pity of death and his abolition is not only a duty or an obligation, but an ethical election of respect to a person that has  mistaken and that it #can and has to redeem.
The public execution of *Zaarmeena, the obligation to carry the *burka, the negation of the right to the health and to the education of the women are only #some examples of the flagrant rapes that against the human rights commit  in said country.
Gentleman President, am outraged by the conditions of arrest of the political prisoners in *Djibouti, but am equally outraged by the hypocrisy of the leaders of the #french State, those who #can, #if they wanted to it, put end immediately to the authoritarianism and to the bad deals that it is responsible the diet of *Djibouti.
This circumstance do not prevents that #such electoral process contradict the agreements of the Nations Joined for the elimination of #all form of discrimination, and that likewise contradict the international pacts on civil rights and politicians.
The European Union fixed his opinion on *Afganistán in a Common Position adopted on 25 January 1999, in the that affirmed clear and unambiguously that will demand the respect of the human rights in *Afganistán and, in particular, will defend the rights of the #afghan women.
We have to hear the calls of the International Federation of the #Red Cross and loan attention to the grave situation in that it finds  these persons, that in the past remained decimated by things #such as the orange agent, employed by the #EE.UU. Now, the natural catastrophes *les cause problems still greater.
To title of example, and among *tantos #others, the General Council of *Pirineos Oriental has approved a help of 42 millions of frank, the region *Languedoc-*Rosellón, a help of 50 millions, the Senate, a help of 400.000 frank and, finally, the #french Government announced a help of 1,2 *millardo.
Gentleman President, only want to say that the liberal do not want to take part in these votes on the natural catastrophes because we think that this subject do not competes to the European Parliament and believed to have understood that we no longer #would have to treat this type of decisions.
*Eso *me Allows *decirles that the Speaker had wanted to be with *ustedes in these moments, but, lamentably, as *ustedes know, is delicate of health these days and, therefore, in his name, in the of the Table and in the #mine own, *les wanted to express to #all *ustedes his best wishes for these Christmases, for this next year and went to say the next #millenium.
And without embargo, of this product live *bastantes families of agriculturalists in the producing countries, and especially, in *Baviera, that do not have to be abandoned to his luck in a period in that the prices drop constantly, #as well as they neither have to remain empty determined agricultural zones by temporary difficulties caused by the irregularities in the operation of the market.
This change carries to cancel determined articles of the ancient regulation and #this is it that takes the new regulation, and takes well; *nosotros vote in favour of the new regulation together with the amendments of the Mr. *Mayer, signalling that this proposal of regulation do not has any sequela on the budget.
The Commission backs #many of the amendments that have proposed , especially #that that mention a budgetary control more severe, by #if it produced  a political evolution refusal in the country, and also the proposal so that it deliver  a final report the year 2004.
In the Council is not  forming a consensus on this question, by it that regret *muchísimo *tenerle that say that I do not see the most minimum possibility that during the #german Presidency #can conclude  this subject, in any case no of a positive mood.
Insisting in the question, do not believes *usted that it #would be better that the European Union took in his hands -no only supported- his charitable influence on *Marruecos to demand that in these six months, that are very sensitive, achieved  this just referendum that so much expect the *saharauis?
Subject: Measures of support to the insular regions of the *UniónSegún the article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #one of the obligations of the Union is the adoption of measures to reduce the delay of the regions or islands less favoured.
I know that in the next days will begin in *Nairobi the negotiations of peace on the internal situation in *Sudán and, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, *me ask #if it #can not  pose this same question in said negotiations, so as to that the Government of *Sudán perceive the strong pressure of the international community.
#Which are the modalities of participation that the Presidency in exercise of the Council has foreseen for the European Parliament in the next Summit of Bosses of State and of Government of the European Union and of the countries of *América Latin and of the *Caribe, that will take place in River of *Janeiro the next month of June?
A possible participation of deputies of the European Parliament in the Conference of the Bosses of State and of Government of the European Union, *Latinoamérica and the *Caribe that will celebrate  to finals of June of 1999 in River of *Janeiro, regulates  according to the procedure that the Council agreed on 30 October 1998.
By it that refers  to the Commission, this institution has been already object of a particular report of the Mr. *Bourlanges, that this Assembly approved do not takes a lot and that comports a series of proposals directed to improve his operation.
#If also in the future the Parliament will follow showing some prudence to the hour to entrust increasingly tasks to the Commission, will mean that it will have known *perseverar in the spirit of the resolution of the colleague *Herman, to the one who with #a lot of taste go back to *rendir homage.
Finally and especially, transparency, democracy and rigour for the Council, #if it wants to be a day a true government, but with #this go out surely of the field of the Report *Herman and even of the Report *Bourlanges to go in in the of the future conference *intergubernamental that this morning announced -*me has seemed to hear- the President in exercise, thing of the that *me congratulate #if  *nos confirms.
Certainly, it treats  of a subject that will have to be resolved of a global way and, for *ello, is indispensable, before that at all, a new cultural approximation of the group of the #czech society but corresponds to the Government of *Praga activate #all the legislative measures that favour this integration.
In this sense, create absolutely pertinent the initiative of the #german Presidency to extend the program *PHARE also to the support of the social dimension of the economy of the countries candidates.
Like this as, from the point of sight of the diversity of the nature, the situation of these countries #can consider  even very fine or, at least, considerably better that in the greater part of the States current members.
As I already have had opportunity to say many times in these debates, in my opinion the greater deficiency of these countries is the administration and the judicial system, #as well as the fault of modernisation and of investments.
*Eslovenia, the penultimate in the row of the countries with the that are negotiating: especially in the report on the progresses of November remained clear that regarding the harmonisation in general *Eslovenia had not taken the sufficient progresses.
By error -*me has signalled it the Mr. *Speciale, the one who was speaker for *Eslovenia-have signalled a series of delays suffered by *Eslovenia in the *preparativos for the adhesion, without that it have pronounced the following positive sentences that *me #would enjoy still went included in the record on the subject, #if it #can be.
We #would have to find a balance among the situation that gave  in the past *cuando had to pray that *nos came to visit and the present situation in that the visitors are so numerous because the European Parliament, graces also to our work, has converted  in more important.
The civil servants of the Commission cooperate a lot in our work and *les remain appreciated thus, but, for this minority of requests that the Commission has not been able to resolve, is evident that is not a fine practice the entrust so much in the personnel of the Commission.
I believe that the Defender of the Village has defended of sufficient form the transparency and the information, and finish, gentleman President, with a *alegato in favour of a change of style, so that *Europa do not represent the *hermetismo and the bureaucracy, but the democracy and the transparency.
Keep disposals by the that the community institutions #can deny to facilitate to the Defender of the Populate documents receiving of form properly reasoned to his professional secret or because the civil servants and the rest of employees pronounce  in name and following instructions of his administrations, no only is not necessary, but especially improper.
In September of 1997, the Commission wanted to concede 35 millions more to the program. The European Parliament called to the order to the Commission because in the case of a simple budgetary increase is not necessary the procedure of *codecisión.
These amendments procure to improve the fight against the fraud and the Mrs. *Peijs has  *percatado of the most important of #all, that treats of the form to relate the costs of collection with the criteria of execution.
To #the same time *emplazo to the Commission to that take  very seriously the application of the White Book so that the concept that my Group and *yo back #can take reality. I am convinced that this White Book opens the path to a sustainable mobility on a long-term basis in *Europa.
Like Group of the Popular Party European *nos see forced to refuse the proposal of the Commission to introduce a uniform system of *tarificación for #all the moods of transport on the base of the called social costs *marginales.
And to me *me seems that it #would be important that this Parliament showed the priority that attributes to the relations with the regional and local authorities, that represent the intermediate levels of #all can, of #all institutional political structure; in definite, with *ellos share our elective character.
The Greens have voted against of the proposal of agreement of fishing with the *Seychelles as we also have voted against of other agreements of fishing, no because *nos *opongamos to the agreements of fishing in principle, but because we estimate that it is precise to modify the approach that follows the EU.
On the other hand, I am fully in accordance with the unconditional backrest to the military intervention of the NATO, for treating  of a necessary operation, correct and positive, and the help to the neighbouring States. Without embargo, there #be a point that throw in fault.
Therefore, in this case, regarding Serbian and *Kosovo, after ten years of intermittent negotiations, of transgressions of the human rights, of rapes, of slaughterings, of destructions and of deportations, in the origin of the *cuales *nos find always with *Milosevic, did not exist, alas, another solution, as it did not go the utilisation of the strength to detain these crimes!
Like this as, only we have offered to the SIN a hall of wait, some terms of admission permanently differed, as #if it treated  of a mirage, it that generates the exclusion, the discrimination, the frustrations and the humiliations.
In effect, #all the States confront  to the problems of destruction of the environment, of pollution or even of congestion of the urban centres. In this sense, the goal of *internalizar the external costs generated by the different moods of transport is perfectly justified.
By this reason the package of measures relative to the railways foresees explicitly the granting of subsidies to the lines *férreas *cuando there are external costs *impagados in moods of competitive transport, as for example the road.
And I finish, gentleman President, going back to appreciate sincerely the amply favourable report presented and the opportunity that  *me has offered to explain the position of the Commission regarding the amendments that consider inadmissible and that expect that they #can reexamine to the sight of it that have said.
In the first place and before that at all, it wanted to appreciate to the acting speaker, the Mrs. #Colombo *Svevo, the hard work made and the disposal that has shown to collect the amendments and suggestions of the Commission of Freedoms Public and Inner Subjects.
It constitutes the security a priority for the Commission, *cuando #this *presiona to countries like Swiss so that it dismantle his restrictions of the transport by road or *cuando imposes the competition and a liberalisation in this sector, in detriment of the rail transport, although this last was safer and ecological?
Gentleman President, will have been necessary the death of forty persons in the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, in terrible circumstances, so that the #european authorities take consciousness of the consequences of the uncontrolled development of the transport by road in the zones of mountain.
It is evident that the results of the investigations *esclarecerán the circumstances of the drama, and in this sense, have to congratulate to the #french Government for having acted with rapidity and for having public fact the first resulted of the investigations.
Gentleman President, in the past weeks, the #burmese diet has gone back to drop in the infamy: the Saint Mrs. *Suu *Kyi, our Prize *Sájarov, that did not enjoys of freedom of movement, #can not at least go back to see to his husband before it died.
On the other hand, until they do not guarantee  the human rights and do not restart  this democratic process wished by the immense majority of the #burmese village, will be impossible to establish normal relations and, add, board any type of relation with this country.
It is very #sad to ascertain that, only a chamber of century later, begins to have a small possibility that it treat  with justice to the victims. But even this small possibility looms with disappearing #if it hides  the implication in the genocide of the current political leaders.
The solution, therefore, is only #one: an International Penal Court, a natural judge attendant to judge #all the crimes against the humanity, committed by any person, in any place and in any time.
To my mood to see, the modifications proposed prejudice seriously to the small employers and to the economic sector that it treats , since to date #this have been the relations of supply usual and his efficiency has remained shown.
We are convinced that #all the citizens *estonios have to have freely of plural information so much on the advantages as on the problems of the adhesion to the equal that expect the celebration of a referendum to decide the belonging of the country to the EU.
The congratulate thus, and also the congratulate for having left proof that the measures proposed by the Commission #would not have to aggravate the cost of the transport, but allow an utilisation of the most efficient infrastructures and more respectful of the environment.
The companies of transport #european, treat of the railway, of the transport by road, of the aerial traffic or of the maritime and inner navigation, are the most modern of the world.
By it other, #would wish that the relative questions to the rights of the boy appeared in the agenda *prioritario of the European Union, since only in this way will be able to defend our future and our position among the community of States civilised.
Base in the article 235 of the Treaty in place of the 129, #can carry to exclude of the program *DAPHNE #all the subjects related with the violence, the sexual exploitation and the treats of women and boys, with the excuse that these subjects no *atañen to the public health.
Support categorically the efforts of our two Commissions, so much the Commission of Rights of the Woman like the Commission of Subjects Inner, that, as it wanted to say, have tried to expand of different ways the proposal modified of the European Commission.
Therefore, I have said that this procedure #would conduct to the absurd, and the absurd has to be always refused in the interpretation of any article, and much more in the case of a motion of censorship, that is a highly political instrument.
The aging, like the greater part of the stages in the life of a person, affects of distinct way to the men and to the women, by it that do not treats  at all of a neutral phenomenon with arrangement to the distribution among sexes.
Numerous organisations no governmental have proposed that in the next reform of the Treaty of the EU include  a relation of the fundamental rights of the citizens, among the that #would appear the level of subsidy minimum.
The Commission proposed in the Diary 2000 deepen and expand even more the reform of the year 1992, especially with seen to improve the competitiveness of the #european agriculture so much in the inner market as in the external markets.
In the Union promotes  the sale of the starch and of his products derived by means of helps to the production *cuando said products use  in industrial sectors without mechanisms of protection in front of the import, #such as the chemical or pharmaceutical industries or the industry of the paper.
I believe that also the investigation of the effects in the field that still today #can describe of product of niche, is very important, by it that #many thanks to the Mr. *Garot for having put the finger in the sore and have forced to the Commission to take *algo with foundation and orientation.
In the bottom, the subject of the rich animal feeding in proteins already treated  in the agreement of *Blair *House, that takes reference to the seeds *oleaginosas transformed *trituradas. But said agreement resulted so *restrictivo that finished hampering the development of the crop of seeds *oleaginosas in the EU.
I ask to the Commission #if, of compliance with the current communicative courses transatlantic in matter of agriculture, #can communicate to the States Joined that these measures are similar to the that adopt the States Joined, and that, as a result of *ellas, has remained suppressed the relative restriction to the million of tonnes of seeds *oleaginosas *trituradas.
The greater part of the enlargements of capacity, carried out to answer to the growth of the demand, make  at present in his greater part out of the European Union, already was in States Joined or in emergent countries like Chinese, the Indian or *Brasil.
But, after all, it corresponds to the Parliament and to the Commission make the fine work, and, especially, take advantage of the opportunities that still exist in these markets and that no longer there #be for the massive products. In the first the opportunities #be.
*Me Seems that the President of this Parliament, that has taken all it possible to keep this colloquium out of the halls of the Parliament, has not acted like a President of the Parliament, but like a *correligionario of the Mr. *Aznar and regret it.
As *eso is particularly important before an electoral campaign, in the that #some deputies *honorarios are using knowingly the title to give the impression of that they follow being deputies to this Assembly, wanted to *instarle to that it write it before possible to #all the that they still have this title for *informarles on the new article and the new situation.
Now *incoaré a process in the Court of First Instance of *Luxemburgo with the question of principles: #who determines the order of works of the deputies chosen, with #all type of sanctions economic, *nosotros same or the Table?
In another order of ideas, gentleman President, #would fit to think #if has sense that, in the last weeks of the current term of office, this Assembly pronounce  on the suspension of the parliamentary immunity of a colleague that *nos took to know that it did not go  to present to the elections.
From now on, from the next term of office, the competitions of this commission, of this deceased Commission of Regulation, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities, will deliver  among two great commissions: the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens and the Commission of Subjects Institutional.
This strategy involves the suitability of an a lot greater efficiency in the control of the costs of the State, of an improvement in the efficiency and quality of the public cost.
It is necessary to increase the percentage of participation in the markets of work, guaranteeing a greater flexibility of these markets, adapting the systems of protection social and reducing the costs of work, especially the of low qualification.
With a view to reach a *aseguramiento sustainable of a high level of employment is precise to develop a strategy to longer term allocated to discover social potentials of creativity, innovation, spirit *renovador, disposal to the investment and to the attainment in the sense of the guidelines of the politics of employment.
#If by means of the caution to the hour to elevate the liquid wages increase the gains and the investments in new places of work, did not suffices with dismissing to the collaborators with a gratitude by the prudence shown.
I will say to conclude, gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission subscribes with taste his proposal to proceed of systematic mood to an annual evaluation of the set up by the States members of the great orientations, it that it #can carry out from the spring of the 2000, on the base of these recommendations by countries.
By it that refers  to the politics *macroeconómica, has to have an exchange of opinions among the pertinent instances on each #one of the elements of the combination of political -fiscal politics, tendencies *salariales and monetary politics- so that each #one of *ellas #can contribute fully to the growth and to the process of creation of employment.
In relation to the monetary politics, #can give the impression that exist differences concerning the previous year, because it takes into account the fact that now, to difference of the past year, exists a Central Bank independent European and did not suits to interfere in this independence.
#If it continues the fine collaboration of the last weeks among the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will be able to approve still before the #european elections #all the normative device for an independent office of fight against the fraud.
It did not fits doubt that the Council, #as well as the Parliament and the Commission, are taking #all the possible efforts directed to struggle against the fraud and, especially, also out of the procedure of approval of the management.
Neither it is of receipt that against of the budgetary rule -repeat, against of the budgetary rule- was usual, especially in the field of the investigation, pay *anticipos without that know  the number of the participants and of the participants or the costs that will follow  of the measures in question.
But to the equal that the European Court of Accounts and probably also the European Parliament, the Council concedes also a big importance to that undertake  a total modernisation and a complete reformulation of the budgetary regulation.
Happening to the subjects of bottom of the report that have presented and that now has to appear like annex of this resolution, there were three important subjects that put of relief, #all it *cuales have remained confirmed by the report of the Commission of Experts.
The decisions on the approval of the management do not have to represent a too much heavy charge and *gravosa for the Parliament, #can not get to a situation in the that no *nos *atrevamos to approve the budgetary management.
Already then, in December, in the debate on the approval of the management for 1996, affirmed since really I am surprised of the arrogance that reflects  in the Treaties, that we have not foreseen the case of the denial of the approval of the management.
As *ustedes know, the Commission remitted on 1 May to the Parliament and to the Council a communication that indicates with precision the consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty for #all the proposals that have presented  with anteriority and that still have not been adopted.
My *segunda worry resides in that *colisionan two models, precisely in the case of the hormones: the famous #american model, #if *me allow *ustedes designate it like this, with a different system of sanitary assistance, and the #european model that plants with more strength in *primer plane the element of the assistance.
It That *me concerns is the question of how will be able to *tratarnos mutually in the future and how will achieve *ponernos of agreement about a greater volume of common standards in the frame of the new commercial round world-wide and, on the other hand, how will be able to guarantee a greater grade of independence and of autonomy in the self-determination of regions and of states.
#One of the most surprising conclusions was that really we did not go by behind the States Joined in any terrain, except an exception, in the terrain of the services, and in #all the services from the lowest until the highest.
But, *Señorías, *cuando treats  to create employment, the States members have to occupy especially of the structural measures, the reduction of the labour costs, the *flexibilización of the work, the promotion of the work part time and, sure enough, ascertain that it remains a lot for taking in this field.
#If #this is the council that *le have given his juridical services, is also it that the civil servants of the Commission *nos explained in the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and Industrial Politics, and no *nos convinces of the all and perhaps #would not be bad idea go back to study it *jurídicamente.
It wanted to say to the Mr. *Prodi that in our Group believe that, like part of his #european vocation for a new #millenium and for the new *Europa expanded, maybe #would owe *reflexionar on the suitability to introduce in the debate the idea of a constitution for *Europa.
It is necessary to open a true new stage in the transparent and effective operation of the Commission and in his relation with the Parliament, so that the collegiate responsibility do not prevent the individual responsibility of the commissioners.
The Greens have listened with attention his intervention of today, that besides adjusts  well to the letter that *nos sent and in the that loans  a greater attention that in his first intervention to the development sustained, to the environment and to the protection of the consumers.
It True is that, by it that to *nosotros *respecta, is fundamental that the President of the Commission have of a strong Commission, #such as it declared the Professor *Prodi this morning, a transparent and punctual Commission in his relation with the Parliament, a relation *jalonada by commitments that have to respect  in #all moment and that *nos allow to work and progress jointly without *entorpecernos mutually.
Gentleman President *Prodi, *usted was proposed by the European Council in #the same hours in that the NATO attacked *Yugoslavia in virtue of the mandate of the President of the States Joined and of #a lot of bosses of Government of the European Union that *le have designated.
Has *usted now the opportunity to take it, since, in addition to explaining today with the presence of #all the Parliament, also finds  present the majority of the political Groups that already tackled this important point in the last partial period of sessions.
The stage that go to initiate now will have to be to the service of the consolidation, the improvement and the strengthening of it already achieved, a period of reforms of the head until the extremities, like the described #Tony *Blair.
And the impression that *nos has left is the that it has not wanted to talk of this subject. And it is a pity, because the clarity in these subjects is a necessary condition for the acceptance of his remaining and *loables reformist purposes.
Mr. *Herman, it is necessary to distinguish among the planned disposals by the annex of the Regulation for the approval of management and the planned disposals by the annex of the Regulation for other votes.
Lamentably it has not been possible to modify said amendments of commitment, *algo that it had wanted to take, and place that #can not *resignarme to vote in favour of some texts that do not guarantee that the consumer #can distinguish easily the honey mattered of the honey of quality produced in the Community, *me have abstained.
The reforms of the market, that #would have to constitute the *tercer element, consist in a combination still no very defined of proposals *desreguladoras and a frame of definitions necessary for a loyal competition in the field of the only market.
Of #the same mood that the Parliament has to control the fine execution of the community budget, has to verify also the execution of his own budget by part of the General Secretary and by the whole of the civil servants, #whose honesty and qualities are not in question.
In terms more general, support to our speaker in #all his conclusions, included the need to return the decision on the approval of the management in the exercise 1997 to the Economic and Social Committee.
*Permítanme That add it following, from the position of somebody that in the years 1991 and 1992 regretted, in the context of the #german inner politics, that had got  to the disintegration of *Yugoslavia -in the that the Mr. *Milosevic had an essential paper- and that considered  a friend of Serbian.
In the Liberal Group accept the current formulation of the report about the relative strategy to *Rusia, but wish to suppress the point of the postponement of the taking of decisions in this field.
In definite, the fundamental principle here is a principle that has established the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice: the principle of collaboration loyal among the institutions.
Therefore, even sharing the criticisms, in the bottom and in the form, formulated by the speaker, am adherent of a fast collaboration and of a negotiation among the Parliament and the Council that allow to conclude the works on the Statute and approve it.
Without valuing the position that finishes to keep on the subject that *nos occupies, yes have to say that -today like Commissioner and yesterday like member of parliament- have appreciated always, from the coincidence and from the discrepancy, the strength of his arguments and the vigour of his convictions.
In this context also want to say that the term of payment for the new buildings has determined  now definitively to 10 years instead of the 15 previously planned years. With *ello reduce  the interests in some 60 millions of euros and averts  an unseen loan on future budgets.
The General Secretary *nos has ensured in the debate that have had with the in the *concertación and in the commission that #this is the start of a new politics of personnel that bases  especially in that the quality and no the passport was the principle for a promotion.
Without embargo, the *APG that today *nos occupies already gives the first indications that the Union will have of a new financial frame, that has found  a balance among the rigour that prevails in #all *Europa and the financial requirements of the political key of the Union.
Tonight we have in the Assembly three extremely demanding deputies, excellent and although the deputies know my political record, that diverges of the record of the Mr. *Jarzembowski, nobody #can deny the affection and the respect that seat to *él and to his work.
. (OF) Gentleman President, distinguished lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, also in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens the debate was marked by the question of #if we apply here the principle of the maximum harmonisation, proposed by the Commission or #if we remain provisionally with the harmonisation of minima.
Therefore, *me seems that it corresponds to the that wish a maximum harmonisation put this case no only in terms of it that it is good for the market and the only market, but in terms of how #can elevate the levels of information and protection in the back stages to the debate of this managerial proposal before it go back for his *segunda reading.
The idea that in any circumstance the fact to have a lawyer to his service *le guarantees the minimum normal protection that corresponds to the consumer do not seems to be a point that deserve to mention.
The long procedure of conciliation that have happened has had a decisive influence to the hour to achieve that the maximum level of rests of *pesticidas in the *potitos have remained fixed in a 0, 1 *mg by *kg, it that in the practice involves *potitos free of *pesticidas, as it is not possible to measure levels lower.
Certainly *usted took his contribution, following the excellent work of his predecessor, the Mr. *Hänsch, to guarantee that, in these concrete moments, were in conditions to face up to the electorate so that we #can bear the criticisms and the cynicisms of the that went to be object.
The Council considers that in front of the threshold of the century *XXI, *Europa do not has to allow that they steal  collectively the rights to the group of population more numerous in *Kosovo and that exert  against #the same grave systematic rapes of the human rights.
The text of commitment of the European Parliament insist as in that in Colony was designated the high representative for the *PESC, that was supported by the unit of planning and of fast #alert and that was in conditions, by his personality, to exert an important paper.
Regarding the institutional reforms, have to give the thanks to the Mr. *Biagio Of #Giovanni, President of the Commission of Subjects Institutional, by the proposals that puts on the table so that they take  in consideration in the new term of office and by the current and future Presidency.
The how comport  the Central bank European, the how configure his politics of types of interests and monetary, the how expand  the infrastructure and #if it #would not be possible at last expand more the #european infrastructure, #all #this are things that influence essentially on the competitiveness, the unemployment and the situation of the employment in *Europa.
The agricultural costs go to remain limited really by half term in 40.500 millions of euros to the year for the actions of market more 13.000 millions of euros for the rural development in the period comprised among the year 2000 and the 2006.
But still we have to take more, by it that it is correct and necessary that the Council have expressed his disposal to cover the need of credits additional for the *Balcanes, got the case, by means of a review of the financial forecasts.
The clause of review in the sector of the cereals shows that the Bosses of State and of Government have not excluded the possibility or even the need to introduce back improvements.
Lady Speaker, do not award my confidence to the President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, because it has justified the war of the NATO *definiéndola as «necessary»: a #european war initiated and carried out *vulnerando a principle of Right International and despising to the Nations Joined.
For *ello, is precise to reactivate the left right-separation, take of the Parliament a true political instance and not looking for the consensus as they have taken the Governments when designating to the Roman Mr. *Prodi.
As only #swedish in the commission have followed of wall and have contributed to the debate during half year presenting, among other things, amendments *acordes with the criteria of the Party of the Environment, is to say, *me have opposite to that  *desligue to the deputies of the constituents and of the countries members introducing wages, taxes and retirements of community character.
For the #european countries treats  to refuse this logic, with the support and the reciprocal cooperation of the Russian Federation in the interest of the peace and of the prosperity of #all.
Second: make a reform of the own politics, especially in the sector of the agriculture and of the structural Bottoms, by like this say it, reactivate our politics and third: the *aseguramiento of the finance of these politics in the next seven years.
The master plan that had presented for *ello the Commission has not happened without changes the more of two years of debates in the Parliament and in the Council and recognise that #this has not been advantageous for the subject in #all the points.
The political and social cohesion is #one of the basic principles of the Treaty of the European Union and believe that #all the institutions of the Union have to keep firmly faithful to this basic principle.
Gentleman President, the commitment of *Berlín is not to celebrate it, like any commitment, and much less in my country -have to talk also like Greek- since the #greek Government has accepted regulations that *nos put to #the same level that *España, *Irlanda and *Portugal, countries that are not so poor like the #mine and that already take part in the euro.
There are other questions also in the that have taken important advances: by a part, in it that *atañe to the respect of the norms of *comitología that existed, treating that they did not modify  under rope these norms; by #another, in relation with the participation of the Parliament, with possibility to review annually the process.
*Séptimo: In the frame of the *reorientación of the bottoms that, according to his ideas, wanted to carry of *FEOGA-Guarantee to the second *pilar, only has gone to stop to this second *pilar a small part of it that #would have been possible #if we had imposed the *degresión.
The Council, that has ranged  with this logic of the Commission has retained without embargo the idea of intervention public «*ad *hoc» in case of need and the to establish a network of security of 1.560 euros by tonne.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *cuando in March of 1998 the Commission presented his proposals for the reform of the structural Bottoms, existed doubts on #if it went  to reach an authentic reform and on #if the regulations went  to be able to approve to time so that the new programs #can set up to beginnings of the year 2000, according to the plan traced.
Without embargo, #can *decirle it following: we are had to go back to the previous formula, is to say, that the *review for the dairy market take  in the year 2003 and, of course, the Commission is also had to include in his analysis the question the *supertasa in the frame of this *review .
By #all #this the instrument of the Social Bottom European is fundamental, #as well as it is fundamental that the no governmental organisations and the *tercer sector, especially of face to a politics of integration concrete, go of the hand from the stage of programming.
Taking into account all #this, #can explain the Council the reason by the that follows thinking that it is legitimate to take case *omiso of the norms that establishes the Statute of the civil servants #as well as of the right of initiative of the Commission established in the article 24 of the «Treaty of fusion»?
The content of said report was debated in the Council during the deliberations on the proposal of the Commission to determine the exact rules for the structural help of the Community in the sector *pesquero.
#All improvement of the relations, included the possible future negotiations on an Agreement of Trade and Cooperation, will depend of the back progresses that *Croacia take in the fulfillment of the requirements established in the frame of the conditions.
*Cuando Tomorrow present his position concerning the decisions of the ministers of agriculture #as well as of the Bosses of State and of Government, will approve *ustedes a reform in the that also #can  recognise the hand of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, lady Commissioner, gentlemen Commissioners, east is the last big debate of the term of office, and treats  of an excellent debate on a very emblematic question: the Diary 2000, besides in *Berlín. *Berlín, with the #german chancellor, the *Reichtag , that has been recovered, to the equal that the eagle, and even the war.
Gentleman President, *permítame, to avert be subjected to the pressure of the time, that take *algo that usually #be  take at the end of the interventions, in concrete wanted to give the thanks to the Mrs. *Wulf-*Mathies by his constructive cooperation with the Commission of Politics Regional of our Parliament.
Like this as, in June of 1998, and of compliance with the Statement *aneja to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal to review the decision on *comitología of 1987 with the goal to simplify and *esclarecer the procedure, #as well as to open it more to the control of the Parliament.
It assumes a full juridical value and allows a political dialogue with the Commission in those occasions in that the Parliament consider that a measure proposed #would provide excessive powers of application to coast of the Assembly, *algo that already has exposed of way very *convincente the Mr. *Corbett.
It wanted to finalise leaving proof of the pleasure and the satisfaction that *me produces all it that have reached together to the hour to improve the chapter of the politics of employment and the social politics in the European Union.
And in last place, gentleman President, because I believe that it is perfectly legitimate that #if it treats  to defend the human rights -that, by true, leave enough that wish in *México-, defend  much better with an agreement that include a democratic clause -as it occurs in this global agreement- that with the agreement in vigour that did not contains this democratic clause.
Also *me #would enjoy to highlight the points that, to my understand, are newer inside this agreement. For example, the inclusion of the democratic clause like essential element of #the same, since it goes to promote the respect of the human rights in this Latin American country.
*Yo Want to *asegurarles that the Commission engages  formally to keep informed to the Parliament in #all moment -as already it is  taking- of the advances in the negotiation in course, #as well as of the final result, before it subject  the Agreement to the conjoint Council.
We are proud that at the end the #german Presidency, of common agreement with the States members, have reached to solve big part of the complex problems derived of the confluence of perspectives political very varied that until the last moment have hampered the integration of *Schengen.
On the other hand, the protection of the personal data with the System of Information of *Schengen is a particularly important question. We do not forget, *Señorías, that the Common Authority of Control has adopted a report *demoledor.
Of another side, it is necessary *averiguar how the control effected by the provider, that probably is the only control truly effective, #can be perfected in the future from the point of sight technical and economic.
Gentleman President, do not agree with his interpretation of how take the vote on the program of the structural Bottoms, because the general regulation is in fact the regulation that regulates #all the other looks of the regulations of application.
But, in this case, the Monday at night there was varied important meetings, among *ellas the of the Commission of Budgets, and *yo was absent of the Commission of Budgets because it was gathered with the Commission of Subjects Juridical.
To informative title, the European Parliament has the intention, after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and the enlargement of the *codecisión, to change of position on 49 first readings inscribed in the frame of the cooperation and on 15 files approved in first reading to title of the cooperation.
And not forgetting that, more that a happy end, the popular query will be only a step more, decisive, true is, in the already long trek that will allow that the village of *Timor Oriental, after centuries of #portuguese colonisation and of a chamber of century of brutal #indonesian occupation, was at last owner of his destination.
I believe that surely it is the wish of #all *nosotros take a call to the European Commission so that it take all it possible to pacify the situation in *Timor oriental, with the end to allow the peaceful celebration of said referendum the next 8 August.
These three questions reflect also the fundamental values that chair our Union: the freedom of expression, the State of Right, the power of the village and the humanitarian looks.
In #all his contacts with the authorities of the country, the Commission has reiterated his posture regarding the respect of the fundamental human freedoms and the State of Right.
It has recognised that the risks of the nuclear energy in the *Europa central and oriental have purchased a totally new dimension, although to #the same time has ensured that the negotiations with the countries candidates to the adhesion open new possibilities.
In the Czech Republic have conceded  helps in the frame of the Program *PHARE to the responsible authorities of the nuclear security and to improve the security of the nuclear head office of *Duckovani.
In the actuality, do not exists a formal agreement with the #czech authorities in the frame of *PHARE so that the technical organisms of security of the European Union carry out a global evaluation in matter of security.
In relation with the economic looks of the project of *Temelin, the Commission supports the development of a strategy in matter of energy that take properly in consideration the energetic performance and the diversification of the sources, and *PHARE has supported this orientation in distinct projects.
In June of 1997, the Commission *nos presented two proposals to simplify the regulation of 1999, and *ello so as to relieve the obligations of the companies -especially of the #SME- in matter of statements and to reduce the costs that weigh on the persons forced to declare.
Also I give the thanks to the Commission for having  engaged to carry out a study in the field of the initiative *SLIM/*INTRASTAT referring in particular to the quality and to the charges that *recaen on the companies.
The High Authority, to the that delivered  the social payments, appeared in last place in the list, whereas first the state, afterwards the social services, afterwards supplying, the banks, #everything it that #can appoint , had priority to the hour to benefit  of it that remained of the failure.
The Mr. *Malangré has signalled it mainly in the exhibition of reasons that, another time, from #all perspective results *inmejorable, with the following words: already it is hour that it take  *algo on the failure in the Community, in the #european context.
It is very *inquietante that a subject like #this was debated a Thursday in the afternoon *cuando there #be here so #few persons, the vote will be tomorrow in the morning and there #be not had in the breast of the national parliaments a properly said debate on the subject.
As it has underlined so much the report of the Mr. *Schmid like the opinion of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens, there #be a series of looks in the that it is necessary to deepen.
In the Commission of Culture *nos have put repeated times in favour that this exhibition do not show only the economic hits Europeans, but also the cultural diversity and especially the successful programs of the European Union.
In front of the disloyal imports, the textile sector, in spite of having  prepared to be able to to be in conditions to confront with hit the challenge of the international competitiveness, do not has of arms with the that defend.
Of here that *urja to the Commission to that it adopt those that measured are necessary to put end to the disloyal competition that it is victim this sector and guarantee like this the plenary fill of the commitments contracted by #all the parts in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
I have repeated in different occasions that in this look of the prevention have left  happen of long #a lot of things in the past years and any political Group neither any Presidency #can affirm here that it has taken it all well to avert this war.
I have lived the final stage, from *Rambouillet until the start of the military actions, and have not found to nobody in the western side, neither the #EE.UU, that have kept an attitude actively *belicista but that tried  get literally until the last second to commitments.
Gentleman President, the Agreement of *Berlín allowed to unblock the main *dossiers of the European Union, but not guaranteeing the future of the European Union to long and even to half term, because the Agreement of the Diary 2000 remained  very short concerning the existent needs.
It treats  of a squad of big quality, of a very balanced squad. It is the result of the constructive queries that carried out with the Bosses of State and of Government, the *cuales respected fully the new powers that the Treaty of *Amsterdam has conferred to the President commissioned.
Today I am here to present to the new Commission and no to present his program, without embargo, #can *prometerles that the conductive thread of #all our program will be to attribute to the European Union a greater importance of face to the #european citizens.
Therefore, it is task *ineludible of this Assembly give off to *Europa of this institutional difficulty in the date it earlier possible, and the only mood to take it is to take to the available Commission -do not prejudge how #can happen in the audiences- and take it impossible for *asegurarnos that it go in in functions in the first available date.
Without embargo, treats  of a fundamental problem: in effect, expand the competitions of this institution, the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, *cuando results that it has not taken  a serious and contradictory evaluation of his operation, *nos seems unacceptable.
It results so much more imperative what that the subject of the dioxin in *Bélgica, that goes to be object of lively debates, affects, without place to doubts, directly to the problematic of the alimentary security, linked, to his time, direct and obviously, with the operation of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade.
But, by it that to *nosotros *respecta, want *tomarnos the auditions as it that they are, is to say, for *permitirnos listen to the Commissioners, *interrogarlos, *formularles ask to end to know better his goals and especially see until how point there #be a fine *adecuación among the charges that *usted *les has entrusted and his knowledges, his competitions and his will of work.
It is necessary that the Commission endow  with the means to exert -with his structures renewed, with his civil servants, #whose disposition surely will have changed- his missions and that do not hesitate in saying to the Parliament and to the Council: as *nos ask that we reach goals, want *pedirles means for *ello.
I believe that, in spite of the constitutional singularity of the relations among the Commission and the Parliament, are founded the worries manifested with a view to the political balance that exists in this Parliament and that do not remains reflected in the breast of the Commission.
Regarding the result, *cuando say that it is «balanced», understand perfectly that they have #some States in the that there #be dissatisfied, but #this is the politics: balanced means that the great present strengths in the European Parliament are strongly represented in the Commission so much by the personalities as by the importance of the wallets.
As well, I attribute an extraordinary importance to this look, #as well as to the report of the Wise persons, but create likewise that these examinations have to take on the history of the Commissioners and his programs and have to take with a big capacity of deepening and of political serenity, because, to my understand, #can not serve of instrument to fix problems that arose previously.
The report of the Wise persons is an instrument of big scope, have to read it and *meditar on *él, but the decision is a weight that have to bear *nosotros, and is in this sense that the dialogue among the Parliament and the Commission purchases an extraordinary importance.
The great challenges of the future, #such as the changes involved by the only coin, the enlargement eastwards and the fight against the international delinquency, have to be confronted with some institutions of the EU that have more capacity of action that in the present.
The renewal of the institutions of the Union is a central subject in the program of activity of the #finnish Presidency as it already signalled the Minister *Halonen in his intervention.
A time finalised the conflict it that has an immediate priority is to support the efforts of the *KFOR to reestablish the peace and the order and reconstruct a civil administration that work under the direction of the Nations Joined.
Regarding the statute of the #european deputies, the #finnish Presidency -and in *eso it is necessary *felicitarla- also has taken a respectful attitude with the fact that the initiative corresponds to this Assembly.
Gentleman President, listening to the #finnish Presidency ascertain the absence of changes substantive in the politics of the European Union, that do not ceases to increase and aggravate the problems of our villages.
Our common failure in the case *Öcalan *nos takes difficult to show clearly to #a lot of persons in *Turquía, so much #if they are #turkish like *kurdas, reason are in principle against the pity of death and, #such as it has said the Mr. *Swoboda, do not plead against the pity of death no only of the Mr. *Öcalan but of #all.
Besides, in #the same frame of exercise of the right, owe *ocuparnos to loan #all type of collaboration to the International Penal Court of the there #be, to pursue to the criminal that have remained  in *Kosovo and, also, in *Bosnia.
#That was the message that #some expected, restless in front of some informations on the absence of bottoms specific and fearing that in these conditions #can drop  in the temptation of *desvestir to a saint to dress to #another and sacrifice essential considered actions when establishing  the budget.
Of #all the promises of the #finnish Government #any is more important that the to occupy  of the problem of the persons -and his families- that no only suffer an illness or disability but also a situation of disadvantage and stigmatisation.
The Council also asked to the Commission that take a report for finals of year on the progresses of the creation of the Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine and on the capacity of #the same to fulfil his functions.
The Council demands to the Commission that take to progress the already begun work by the Committee of *Piensos and Foods of Animals, in the *cual goes back  to examine the legislation on *piensos, and, in his case, presented  additional norms and reforms for a more strict harmonisation of said legislation.
It That yes know is that the office of inspection by the that have struggled (had to *batirnos to achieve an effective budget, so that it created  the veterinary office in *Bruselas and for *asegurarnos that #would apply  the principle of the general inspections in the Community) finds  loomed and harassed.
And now given this situation, as we #can say that the proposal to watch to the European Agency of Drugs and Foods, by welcome that it was, #as well as #all these great gestures, #can work *cuando any individual inspector #can penetrate in the universe of crime and fraud that characterises to #some sectors of this industry.
*Me #Would enjoy to know to where wants to get the Commission, #which are the concrete steps effected, and #if the Commission will take into account the wishes expressed by the Parliament, so much in the reports on the *EEB as in the Green Book on the feeding, the resolution that have formulated to the *respecto.
In the concrete case of the dioxin, among the communication of the Permanent Veterinary Committee and of the network of #alert happened 15 days, whereas the Commissioner *Bonino declared simply that *ella did not take #belgian milk.
Have the duty the responsible Authorities to delete these chemical agents of correct and safe form, following the valid rule, or are leaving knowingly of *aplicarla and deleting these chemical agents of mistaken form?
No, gentleman Baron *Crespo, had a proposal of resolution common that proceeded of two political Groups, the Group of the Popular Party European and European Democrats and the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformist.
#This puts of relief, on the one hand, the responsibility of the competent authorities for the control of these products. On the other hand it sees  clearly that the scandal of the dioxin is not a problem neither a failure of the agriculture.
I think, for example, in the sanction applied, also to *Francia, for having allowed reductions of *cotizaciones social to #some textile companies by the fact to hire personal, in the frame of an international situation, that like His *Señorías know, is very delicate, especially because of the international agreements negotiated, precisely, by the Commission.
In the first place, the proposal to put to the sale the whole of the *taquilla in the #european market has not applied  never in any spot regarding sportive demonstrations of #this *envergadura, as it finishes it to remember the Commissioner #Neil *Kinnock.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds  to the debate of the statement of the Commission on the course given to the second inform of the Committee of Experts Independent that  *les has remitted, as His *Señorías had requested, it before possible.
It #can the Mr. *Kinnock engage to put end with the greater possible shortness to this disciplinary procedure, after his takeover, with the whole Commission like school, so that the Mr. Go *Buitenen #can go back to the work of a form ordered and that it was rehabilitated at last?
But the true essence of #this the constitutes the Recommendation *nº 59 that requests *encarecidamente the nomination of a general public prosecutor European, that requests *encarecidamente a fiscal ministry European with public prosecutors delegated in the States members to create a "area of freedom, security and justice as it states in the Treaty".
The efforts *acumulativos by *modernizar have not been, therefore, sufficiently forceful to substitute a *trasnochada and deficient culture by the practices and the instincts of it that generally designates  new public management as it has developed  in the last 20 years in other diverse modern administrations.
The recommendation to establish a *fiscalía #european, as it proposes , #would mean the existence of a mechanism to interpose a *querella criminal related with the fraud in the EU in #all the Union but #would not affect to the jurisdiction of the national courts.
In the report have detected  a series of points feeble in the breast of the institutions and the recommendations that here take  the sound to correct the problems.
In spite of #this *puntualizaciones, am convinced that the contribution and the support of the Parliament will make possible the fast adoption of the present proposal, so that it remain guaranteed the continuity among the present performance of the Community and the program #whose entrance in vigour proposes  for 1 January of the 2000.
Go back on *ello now and remit to the majority of the Assembly the decision that *usted had taken so cautiously, only by the intervention of the Socialist Group, *me seems a quite insufficient reason, in front of the principle that had applied *usted and with the that #all agreed.
Of face to this debate, *le advance that my Group will want to reach greater concretions in politics of employment, of economic and social cohesion, of modernisation of our economies that take into account to the persons, to the enlargement, to the Mediterranean and to the defence of the human rights all over the world, like axes of our external politics.
Lady Speaker, to begin, *permítame say in name of my Group, that share fully the perspective of the Mr. *Prodi that from morning will be in the threshold of a new beginning, in particular, a new beginning among our two institutions, the Parliament and the Commission, and a new beginning for the own *Europa.
The body of the Treaties of the European Union and, in particular, of the European Only Record, of the Treaty of *Maastricht and of the Treaty of *Amsterdam have to be subjected #all *ellos to a new review in the context of the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
No *me refer to his professional performance, since his personal fortune is remarkable -has known to employ very well his faculties -, but that go to examine it that took *cuando was president of the *IRI, the greater economic organism #italian public, and how many *millardos -better said, talking of lyres, how many thousands of *millardos- especially of the taxpayers *padanos, achieved *dilapidar carrying out a disastrous politics.
As I finish to say, by reasons apparently *contrapuestos, because #one of the subjects that have in front of *nosotros is, expect, only the apparent perplexity and no the distrust of the #european citizens, as it remained shown by the scarce participation in the *comicios of the month of June, although, on the other hand, there #be not doubt that it exists an increasing demand of *Europa.
The appearance of the Mr. *Kinnock showed like this the fault of will by part of the Commission to assume #all the responsibility and #all the managerial competitions regarding the General Directors and his employees.
The here present deputies, and that have made campaigns in the that the social urgency and the fight by the employment were in the centre of the debate, are *comisionados to advance of effective form to #one *Europa of the employment.
The section 4 of the article 29 of our regulation has that a statement of group has to indicate the denomination of the group, the name of his members and the composition of his table.
Gentleman President, the Socialist members of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects believe that the Mrs. *Diamantopoulou has shown to have the aptitudes and the necessary attributes to convert  in a fine Commissioner of Employment and Social Subjects.
In effect, a person that has to be the responsible Commissioner of the inner market and that in his appearance did not stop to pronounce the word subsidiariness denotes an excessive ignorance on the great common tasks of *Europa.
It wanted to know #if, like President of the Commission, has intention to engage  personally with the resolution of the *gravísimos social problems that *subsisten in the interior of the European Union and that, for the Commission, to my mood to see, #would have to constitute an absolute priority.
Two weeks after it alerted  to the world of the most brutal genocide as a result of the elections in an attempt to establish #the same essence of the democracy that *nosotros, like deputies, have to defend first of all, still are in deadlock and any commentator *nos considers important to find a solution.
Gentleman President, today has talked  long and tended on the cynicism and the hypocrisy of the past, but wanted to *decirle that at all is so cynical neither *hipócrita like the fact that they comment the process of auditions those who already have announced that will vote against of the Commission.
#This has to include a consistent application of the norms of the competition, and also a consistent application of the Pact of Stability and Growth, some minimum common norms in matter of taxes, to the equal that #some fundamental principles.
Although the redistribution seems necessary to fund this new priority, it is necessary to take into account the fact that a too much great redistribution comports the risk of *desestabilizar the budgetary balance and politician in the external relations.
In this case, also have to recognise the offences related with the rape of the right to the privacy, offences that comment the services of intelligence of States Joined and of the European Union the 24 hours of the day.
In the space of justice #european the prevention of this type of offences seems to remain only in hands of the cooperation among the Police, without any parliamentary control or politician and without having  elaborated at all to the *respecto.
The solution is not to employ without a purpose the resources in moving to the population of the poor countries to *Europa, but devote these resources to move the #european development to the poor countries.
Without embargo, the European Parliament will run the risk to remain  to the *margen of the debate while it grasp  desperately to his own utopia, #that in the that the citizen goes to see finally the light thanks to the advantages imposed with the #european citizenship.
Still it did not takes *tantos years that the Governments of the States members show  had to collaborate with the European Parliament in subjects so important like the police cooperation, the migratory flows or the common politics in matter of asylum.
The peace and the internal welfare are not allocated to last long, because it neither is allocated to last long the resignation of a world *circunstante that lives in the insecurity, the need and the chaos.
And in this eagerness of concretion, regarding the space of freedom, believe that there are two subjects that deserve a preferential attention: the harmonisation of the procedures of asylum and the immigration *clandestina.
It is necessary to guarantee the right of the citizens to receive an egalitarian deal -*access *to *justice- and to access to the services of assistance legal *cuando see  forced to manage subjects in front of the authorities of other States members.
In the draft of the answers of the Mr. *Kinnock, the civil servants on had written that the problem rooted in that the #dutch civil servant, Mr. Go *Buitenen, had delivered *demasiados documents to the presidents of group.
Gentleman President, go to begin in French, in his very beautiful tongue, to say that have the duty of *expresarle from this time on same my will of not going back to talk in this tongue, while *Francia have not recognised our #basque tongue.
Yesterday same, in his speech, Roman *Prodi went back clearer his orientation *cuando affirmed that it was necessary "to follow restructuring the Only Market and promoting the liberalisation" and underlined on purpose the continuation of the process of liberalisation of the sectors of sakes and services.
My main consideration when judging to the Commission *Prodi is to decide #if this squad of 20 persons *me has convinced that it is able to restore *tangiblemente the public confidence in the European Union and his institutions.
It That #would ask to the manager of the budget of the year 2000 is that it took into account the needs of the Committee of the Regions and that saw #if it fits this place among the places thought in the budget 2000 for the Committee of the Regions.
In this moment have already a statement of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined in the that condemns  it that *sucedió in *Timor, recognise  the rights of his village and orders  the sending of a strength of maintenance of the peace.
Therefore, it is necessary that #all the international community and, therefore, the European Parliament, take a call in these two senses: so that the body of peace go it more quickly possible to reestablish the peace in *Timor Oriental and so that it #can get there the humanitarian help.
The permanent rapes of the human rights, the terror against a peaceful village, miserable and disarmed have been common coin there, but existed from took 24 years: *yo saw it with my own eyes.
We want that it put  term to the tyranny that has suffered the village of *Timor oriental during the 25 last years with the help of the countries of the European Union, of *América and of #all these persons *hipócritas that do not deprive  to sell armaments to the tyrants of Indonesian and of other countries of #everyone.
It #would have to *recordarle that a socialist minister is condemned by a kidnapping and that the socialist Government of his leader, #Felipe *González, was condemned by the Court of Rights Human by the expulsion of 103 emigrants in the border of *Melilla.
We demand, therefore, of the Council an answer to this problem that go to have with the migratory population nomad in #all the European Union, an answer coordinated with the States members, in the that, to #the same time, each assume his own responsibility.
As  *discierne of the statement of the Summit of Gin, the development of the #european capacity to resolve the crises do not alters the systems of defence of the States members.
During the #german Presidency, on 29 March 1999, the Council ratified the article *K.3 of the Treaty of the Union regarding a common position in front of the project of the Convention.
Regarding the political control of the squad that is working in the subject, the #finnish Presidency will study the subject, but in this occasion #can not say at all to the *respecto because I do not have the necessary information.
Gentleman President, believe that the Mr. Deputy will know that it is not competition of the Council manage in front of States Joined the suppression of the compulsory visa for the citizens of the Union, #all time that States Joined is not included in the list attaches to the Decree *CE/574/99.
In accordance with the estimates of the international organisations, in *Corea of the North have died among #one and three millions of persons from 1995 like consequence of the chronic famine owed to natural causes and, besides, to the character of the national system-communist in the power in *Pyongyang.
*Nos Will say, then, why, whereas the Mr. #Solana signs secret documents of the NATO that show that the *UÇK is involved in the traffic of drugs, in the prostitution and in the delinquency organised, the International Strength follows *apoyándolos and the international community follows *armándolos, in place of *desarmarlos as it had agreed ?
The *restablecimiento of a just democratic system is a previous condition for a program of reconstruction and the political responsibility is so much in the hands of the EU like the social and the economic.
I think that #this is the occasion to centre the attention only in the main questions, #this is, that this Agency #can act inspiring in the principles of transparency and of efficiency that, given the existent situation in the *Balcanes, are an essential element.
It takes fault, as, a politics integrated, a common strategy of development, of peace, of stability and of collaboration in the region, #such as it is beginning to *delinearla the Pact of Stability and the Agency of Reconstruction that, with headquarters in *Salónica, will be an effective agency *cuando have exactly this line integrated.
In answer to the that has been a debate of big quality, *me pleases enormously the company of my new colleague, the Commissioner of Budget, *Michaele *Schreyer, #whose presence is a sample of his big interest in this subject and in his financial and budgetary repercussions.
It has been designed to keep the necessary control of the European Union on the program of reconstruction and for *salvaguardar his independence and his right of initiative in the process.
Gentleman President, like the Vice-president of the Commission has renounced to say *algo on the questions of the coin and of the *UCK, #can split of the fact that it do not exists any opinion of the European Union on these questions?
The campaign of security *vial that is carrying out includes the following looks: more houses of control of speed, more proofs of *alcoholemia, a system of fines by points, a better fulfillment of the law that forces to lace  the belt of security.
In conclusion, the deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of the Nations will watch, during #all this term of office, by that the *Europa bureaucratic and *tecnocrática do not develop , but by that *Europa evolve in a harmonious frame and assumed by the group of the citizens of the States members of the European Union.
We think that it is important for the future of the European Union the materialisation of a free field, sure and just and give the welcome to the initiative of the Council to stand out this matter in the Summit of *Tampere.
In the *tercer, chamber and *sexto script of the section 4, the Parliament asks that it was the future "enclosure" the that it determine the competitions of his Table, #as well as the organisation of his groups of work and of his Secretariat, it that #would suppose for #this a wide independence, for afterwards orient the process to his *antojo.
It is directly connected with an effort for strengthening it inaccessible and for reinforcing the mechanisms of control and of repression, of course no to corroborate the rights of the citizens, but for *manipularlos and like this exert a more effective control of his activities.
I create, as, gentleman President, that #if we took *algo useful and durable - and #would want to listen also the opinion of the Mr. Commissioner on #this - #would be that this famous organisation on the that are debating, to investigate the earthquakes etc. had mainly a species of, #would say, code of behaviour on the composition, the publication, on when, where, how, to #who go these informations on the earthquakes.
In addition to these measures, the Commission foresees the possibility to act in coordination with the #FMI to concede to *Turquía helps *macrofinanciera directed to keep the process of reforms in some obviously difficult conditions.
A violent conflict in *Daguestán, attacked with bomb in *Moscú and, #everything *ello, surrounded of rumours on plots and prepared with #all type of theories on it that there #would be behind #this and #all type of relations that take  with, for example, the next parliamentary elections and the attempts of distinct groups to undermine this process.
The Commission has taken part in the recent visit of the troika of the EU to *Rangún, undertaken with the goal of *allanar the path so that it initiate  a political dialogue with *Birmania in accordance with it established in the conclusions of the Council of 26 April.
Maybe it #would be necessary to find a less formal form of constant dialogue with *usted, the Mr. *Priestley and his services to argue the questions of the access and #others *concernientes to the internal organisation of this Parliament.
Like final point want to say *algo on the separation of rubbish. In spite of having in our dispatch of two cubes for the different types of rubbish, which already is a retard in comparison with the previous situation, yesterday in the morning was witness that these cubes  *vaciaban in #the same sack.
In any case, want to ask *encarecidamente that install  urgently a *extractor in the service to avert the nuisance of it that it #can *suceder #if a visitor decides to go to the just service after the deputy have taken use of #the same (this problem also occurs in the *servios of the office of *Bruselas).
*Yo Expect that *cuando believes  an agency of the foods the Commission specify the possibility to investigate *retroactivamente the *piensos employed to feed the livestock and formulate juridical disposals that punish the criminal practices and *recompensen to the active agriculturalists.
Like this as, it wanted to take advantage of this general debate to insist in front of my colleagues and the other institutions on the need to go back to #some principles of the common sense that have seen  scannings by the great theories too much economic and no very human.
In other words, mechanisms of relentless control and norms very strict. The proofs made on meat of *vacuno show that #some of the cases detected do not have his origin in the feeding, but that owe  to the pollution, more in concrete to the pollution with dioxins through the industry or the ovens *incineradores.
It is timely that the public organs and the politicians, already was in the local organisms or in the governments, exert a paper in the regulation of the production and the preparation of foods.
In this sense *África is the mirror of *Europa: the style of life selfish in the that the pure sexual pleasure of the individual converts  in norm, without respect of the #another and social responsibility #any, has a very high price.
It is, in the first place, necessary because these countries try to adapt to some new surroundings of economic and commercial relations that *les create problems, of mood very special, precisely, in the scales of payments, it that to his time affects to the general operation of the market and to his economic development.
Even regarding the own project of the International Monetary Bottom, in the global project of the Bottom on how go to define  the budgets and the costs of said countries leaves  already clearly established that it will have to engage a determined percentage of cost for the social costs.
Personally, the that more *me enjoys is the #danish model: there it offers  a transparent access to the network, applies  an energetic tax that acts like corrector of the prices, exist some clear goals in matter of renewable energies, exists almost a market protected.
Gentleman President, the percentage of resources energetic renewable employees in the energetic production of the European Union is underneath of the 6 %, and the greater part of this percentage corresponds to the hydraulic energy.
Gentleman President, conclude congratulating again to the Mrs. *Ahern, giving the thanks to #all his *Señorías by the positive participation in this question, to the Parliament by the support loaned in this terrain to the Commission, and, simply, saying that we are talking of *algo very important that is to use intelligently the resources and the energy.
For *Sudáfrica the audacious step with seen to an agreement of trade, development and cooperation with the EU is a symbol of his commitment with the economic structuring and to recover fully the place that *le corresponds in the international community.
We have to take #ours the most valuable element of the plan of action previous, #this is, the called punctuation of the inner market, and *nos propose to guarantee the existence of systems effective of evaluation, of follow-up and control and of adaptation of the goals.
The Commission created to finals of October of 1998, immediately after the investiture of the Government of *Dzurinda, by initiative of my ancestor, a group of work bilateral of high level so as to go back to give the necessary impulse to the *preparativos for the adhesion of *Eslovaquia.
The THROW loans help for the repair of houses private and for the delivery of products distinct to the alimentary to make possible the creation of accommodation sufficient for the displaced recently got of *Kosovo.
Subject: Sensitisation of the #european citizen in relation with the EU The EU disburse great sums of money for the impression of thousands of informative brochures on his activities, it that carries achieve, among other things, the utilisation of great quantities of paper, *algo that results little favourable for the environment.
#If of the inspection of the Council of Agriculture give off grave indications of irregularity in the companies of transformation of the linen have to pay the corresponding subventions or has to expect  the pronouncement of his general Direction?
Lady Speaker, this obsolete diet has paid it also the own #turkish village with thousands of deaths in the earthquakes, deaths that #would not have to  regret in a country in #where the laws, the control of the democracy and of the free press work.
To avert any misunderstanding, have to underline that the approach of #Grecia and *Turquía, in spite of his historical rivalry and of his differences, in fact constitutes #one of the main axes of our external politics and of the political security.
I am loved in this first opportunity, to the that has referred  the Mr. President, to treat on this so important subject with *ustedes like deputies to a Parliament that, to end of accounts, has shown a deep and ancient interest in the efforts for reaching the peace in Orient Next.
The Presidency and the Commission have restarted his call in favour that it celebrate  what before a meeting of the committee of follow-up of the group of work for the regional economic development.
The free trade needs also just prices so that the producer and the seller #can obtain the owed benefit, #as well as a truthful labeling of the origin and the processes of the product to satisfy the requirements of the customers in matter of health and election.
The new #israeli Government persists in his politics of colonisation in #palestinian territory and follows being kidnapped by the Party *Likhud that duplicated the number of settlements to hinder the return to the #palestinian territories.
I have not been able to read the text in the tongues of the other countries that form part of the European Union, without embargo, wanted to know before that at all #if it exists a political background in virtue of the *cual the #italian text is wrong or #if they are wrong the #french texts and English.
The disappointing participation in the European elections of this year provided the dramatic proof, #if to fault a proof, that we have to improve the image and the importance of this Parliament to the eyes of the population of *Europa.
The European Union will delete the rights of customs with regard to the 86% of the total volume of the exports of products industrial #south african to the European Union;
*Ustedes condemn in *ellas "the selfishness" of an industry that do not takes another thing but respect the rules of the economic and commercial game that, in the best of the cases, *ustedes have accepted and, in the worst, contributed to establish.
The European Union has engaged  seriously to promote the democracy, the State of Right and the respect of the human rights, among the that they include  the basic labour rights.
The practices *restrictivas in matter of access to the markets, to the credits and to the energy constitute #one of the main causes -generally badly known in our countries- of the underdevelopment, of the *perpetuación of the social inequalities and of the corruption.
The essential principles of negotiation and approaches of solutions treated in the document of the Commission of July of 1999, have found fundamentally up to now a positive echo in our debates kept in the Commission of Subjects External and of Industry.
The problem, in my opinion, resides in knowing #if the World-wide Organisation of the Trade works on the base of norms just so that the world, and no only *Europa, evolve to a sustainable development.
The opening of a new cycle of commercial negotiations *multilaterales is first of all a decision of the President of the States Joined of *América, the one who has fixed the tempo -translate: a negotiation accelerated, a diary tightened-, the one who has fixed the goals...
We #would have to support this round from the start, #would have to show a positive attitude to guarantee that we prevent the protectionism, boost the free trade and expand the prosperity of the world-wide system to other parts of the world.
Second, gentleman President, expect that the Mr. *Lamy take  charge that #everyone take full consciousness that #if the *OMC is important for *nosotros, #if the *OMC is important for *Europa, also will be it for the other commercial partners; and besides, that #that *OMC only will be able to exert his paper #if each Been member takes  charge and follows conscious that it #can not win never an only national interest, but that always will have to be the #european interest, so that these negotiations *nos *pos #can serve of *algo.
It is an option, but is not the #ours, and do not wish that tomorrow, in *Europa, the entrance of the services in the field of the *OMC demand that the norms of competition and of opening to the market govern sectors #such as the health and the education.
Many times they have been mistaken the prognoses that the places of work disappear of the country because it has implanted  a technical more ecological or a more effective or ecological use of the energy, things that want to implant.
In the Council of Colony talked  of the capacity of *Europa to avert crisis and to act with efficiency to the hour of *controlarlas. The references to a military capacity with credibility took  in the context of the control of the crises.
*Europa Always has been in command of the protection of the human rights, of the coexistence and of the tolerance, that have taken of this territory the most advanced in it social, and #can not *permitirnos retreat in these conquests, as *usted has said, of freedom, tolerance and coexistence.
The truth is that the formidable can of the that has the Central Bank European to the hour to take part in front of the national economic institutions and the national banks has been collected inside a diagram quite *críptico.
Regarding the insular regions, it is necessary to signal that in the Union has treated  the problematic of the zones retarded; for example, in #a lot of conclusions of diverse summits and in other communiqués has loaned  a special attention to the islands.
Subject: New community program of fight against the poverty As well it knows the Council, in the frame of the Treaty of *Maastricht, did not reach  any progress regarding the adoption of a new community program of fight against the poverty.
They exist from it takes decades, centuries and thus it also is very important that in our resolution declare that the problematic has to be treated of general form, to the equal that has to look for a general solution, that was notable for the region, and of the *cual derive  the stabilisation and the development of the region in his group.
Likewise, the project signals on this point of the resolution that #if, as it has said  from the Parliament, are conscious that from principles of century have died *tantos soldered in wars as nowadays citizens in conflicts, precisely by these light arms, and #if we are conscious of the numerous arms that export , *transitan or manufacture  in the States members, have, then, an enormous collective responsibility.
This Parliament has a long tradition in this sense, and wish *rendir homage to the work of the Mrs. *Adelaide *Aglietta that it was the first speaker of the report on the pity of death in the world of this Parliament.
The Commission shares the worry of the deputies of this Parliament, and urges to the States members to that they collaborate with the #italian authorities to gather #all the available proofs so that they #can elucidate  the causes of the disaster.
Lady Speaker, my Group approves fully the agreement *interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations that the European Office of Fight against the Fraud has to effect in the institutions, organs or organisms of the Communities, including the European Parliament.
But also it is #likely that have gone too much fast in relation with the deputies, and in this sense *me declare guilty in front of the Mr. *Napolitano, president of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, since I am member of this commission, although perhaps the debate in the Plenary #can *permitirnos warn #some *olvidos.
Second: the future of the electronic activity in juridical and commercial matter depends essentially of #if it reaches  improve the confidence, especially the of the users, in the security and, in concrete, so much in the technical security, for example, regarding the fakes, as also in the juridical efficiency of similar procedures.
A decisive point of support are the electronic signatures By means of a signature #such in electronic format #can guarantee  that, on the one hand, is *constatable the identity of the one who have issued a statement and the have signed, is to say, the identity of the signatory.
Have the conviction that we have found so much a fast solution as also a correct solution to boost the electronic signature and, in consequence, the utility of the new means of information and of communication in the daily life.
Also it is *importantísimo, as they have said other orators, that there #be a possibility of expansion in the international plane because the borders of the European Union are artificial borders regarding this question.
In the spheres of fast technological progress the European Union has to encourage particularly for averting #all future barrier of the inner market like result of contradictory national norms, and has to establish a juridical frame European in an early stage.
In this context wanted to take advantage of my time of word to stand out the possible repercussions of the versions proposed "*Amsterdamizadas" -#if  *me allows to use so horrible term- of the Treaties of *Bruselas and of Blunt in what they refer  to the operation of this part of the only market.
#This is an important proposal and oriented to the future because the gaseous fuels use  increasingly -and *me refer, for example, to fuels like the natural gas liquefied and the gas of oil- and exists also the possibility that the hydrogen use  like fuel in the future.
I will say to finish, gentleman President, that the final element of this proposal is the resource to a committee to keep and put of relief the technical character of this Directive, thing that already have mentioned in my intervention.
By this reason support precisely this directive and, of course, also #would celebrate a lot that in European Parliament took  in general *algo more in *pro of the security in the transport so that #this homogenise  in the states members, as the figures of accidents show clearly that in this field the youngsters see  affected of special way.
How presupposed is #that that, among the costs, forces to distinguish among two very clear-cut categories, #one - the compulsory costs - arbitrated by an authority, the Council and #another - the no compulsory costs - arbitrated by the Parliament?
In the project of budget has foreseen  the creation of new places of work in the Parliament and in the Economic and Social Committee, with the goal to give more efficiency to the administration of these buildings.
The Mr. *Pittella also has presented an extremely important report for *nosotros; therefore, *yo want to manifest my gratitude to the three speakers by the really constructive collaboration that has accompanied the budgetary procedure of this year.
From this point of sight believe that there #be a special contradiction among the fact to push upwards the missions assigned to the European Union, throwing downwards the necessary resources for his fulfillment.
A final note very concrete, but of big importance: it is indispensable to guarantee -#if it is that it has not taken  already- that in the comment of the line *B-7 6000, relative to the no governmental organisations, state a reference to the committee of link.
*Nosotros *nos Guide by these same principles but, in this case, after it that has struggled the Parliament during years, this review of the agreement *interinstitucional, a review of the financial perspectives #such as it defined  in the agreement *interinstitucional, is extremely important for the Parliament.
Happening to the #others institutions, *cuando talk, for example, of the cooperation *interinstitucional, how rigour there was in the information the day that our colleagues previously agreed that it had to take  the Common Organisational Structure? Or, #which is the reality nowadays *cuando decide that it is necessary to dissolve this common structure?
It is necessary to simplify a lot the juridical frame for these companies -in *Europa have 18 millions of #SME, a 50% of the *cuales do not have any employee-, so that they #can concentrate in the fundamental requirements, or was, in satisfying the needs of the customers and offer the products and suitable services.
Nevertheless, on the other hand, *yo believe that we #would have to keep the amount that the Union already has announced in the political plane, specifically that they will put  to disposal 500 millions of euros for the year 2000, so as to avert cause the impression of that the Union  *desdice of his political commitment.
In this context, it is necessary to have always present the fact that the Council of Government acts like collegiate organ, and that #all the decisions have to communicate  to the public of way clear and coherent.
Finally, I receive equally with big satisfaction that the Mr. *Duisenberg have commented the point treated in the report about the need to reduce the costs of the payments *transfronterizos, especially in the smallest payments that affect to individual members.
By that, with the presence of craft of the Council of Ministers and of the European Commission, at present the national Governments anyway know #which are the votes, and #can exert his pressures to his taste, only that of form totally *incontrolable and invisible.
Since the debate of today is fundamentally among the Parliament and the Central Bank and no *nos corresponds to *nosotros play any #another paper, wish to signal only, answering to the worry of #some parliamentary, that will have occasion to debate here the problem of the coordination of the economic politics, that is competition of the Commission.
The rise of the types of interest, in determined occasions #can *asemejarse or be more related with raising the foot of the pedal that, by the contrary, with braking the impulse of the economy and of this mood advance more slowly.
Certainly we have planned, to begin, study the mood in that we #can create the bookmark that  *nos has requested like the half to keep the pressure on *nosotros, in the first place, but also on #others, #as well as to guarantee that all makes  with the most complete transparency possible in the immediate future.
*Nos *congratulamos Of the commitment assumed in the highest level to act in cooperation with the countries of origin and the countries of traffic to the hour to tackle the questions of the immigration.
From a point of sight general, results very significant that the Council have announced a precise calendar for the relative measures to the space of security.
In the migratory politics has been important to say with clarity that exists a basic agreement on the control, on the capacity of absorption and of integration of a country and on the fight against the abuses in this field.
The statements of *Tampere on the space of freedom, security and justice, the best access to the justice, the efforts by a more intense fight against the criminality, are definitely positive looks of the balance.
*Me Seems a fine news for the fight against the terrorism, although the resolution of the Parliament do not say it, the suppression of the formal procedure of extradition in the case of persons condemned with firm sentence.
Gentleman President, this High Assembly approved with big majority on 3 April of the last year my report on the enlargement eastwards and the inner security. In that occasion agreed  create a European Academy for the Inner Security.
With #the same intention of *soslayamiento of the States, the report *Dehaene proposes that in some cases #can modify  the Treaty by simple decision of the Council or even by a decision adopted so only by qualified majority, thing that results absolutely unacceptable, as it is absolutely contrary to our conception of #one *Europa that respect to his nations.
The citizens of the Union need a democratic constitution, with a catalogue of competitions in the that the responsibilities are clearly established and in the that the principle of the subsidiariness have a real content.
Gentleman President, there #be a dog that still has not barked in this debate, and wanted to call the attention on the failure *garrafal of the report *Dehaene regarding treating properly - only mentions it of happened - the regional look of the government of *Europa.
#If it has produced  a delay in the nomination of a speaker has been because the representative of the Radicals in the meeting of the coordinators to choose to a speaker asked that it postponed  the nomination.
The Commission thinks that the presence of the States members in the Council of Administration #would be in definite well for the Agency and #would facilitate the coordination of the activities of reconstruction of the Community and of the States members.
(The Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98/2 relative to the poured of radioactive waste in the sea (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0014/1999 - 1999/0096(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer)
Considers that the vote only constitutes a question of procedure, necessary to be able to continue the negotiations with the Council regarding the creation of the statute of the deputies to the European Parliament.
At present they exist two problems that brake the advance of the electronic trade: the difficulty to verify the identity of the users and the consumers, and the uncertainty with regard to #if the operations in line are legally *vinculantes.
. (*PT) The Central Bank European, in spite of exerting a fundamental paper in the politics and in the #european economy, works with independence of the Council, of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments, it that results unacceptable.
Among other measures, the Governments approved also relative common norms to the granting of asylum political to the refugees needed and the editorial of a Letter of rights fundamental.
The company has the responsibility to keep to the worker *empleable and the worker has the responsibility to take part in his continuous information and in the continuous development of his capacities and of his skills.
It is necessary to have an increase of the power of the employees and of his representatives to take cost his right to impugn the bottom of the economic reasons that motivate his dismissal, it that *nosotros call the amendment *Wolbert-*Michelin and that will propose so that tomorrow the vote His *Señorías.
I believe that it has remained clear that, motivated by the problem of the *Michelin, poses  a subject that constitutes the centre of the reflections in the European Union in the actuality. It is to say, on the one hand, the subject of the competition, and, by #another, the of the social cohesion.
I am convinced that the movements by the peace against the nuclear arms that so much took in the years seventy and eighty, #can restart his activity in collaboration with *nosotros and our Parliament, so that we #can live for real in a world #where do not exist this type of arms.
Also we have *presionado so that they adopt the necessary measures so that the agencies of help visit the zone to take an assessment on the terrain of the needs and expect that this mission #can carry out in the next days.
We #would have to bet so that events like the European Capital of the Culture or the European Cultural Month #can take place in *Irlanda of the North or in the Basque Country, since in this new political frame that it is *Europa #can find valid solutions for these two conflicts.
In relation with the network of partners, of correspondents and of other organisms, his mission #can not  confuse - #this is an important and fundamental data, on the *cual the commission debated amply - with the mission and the functions that has *Eurostat in this sector.
The Audiovisual Observatory European elaborates statistics for the companies of the audiovisual industry, a work of the that occupy  also *Eurostat and the national institutes of statistics, and until some point his work and the work of the Observatory  *solapan.
In this moment established  -read *textualmente- that "the goal of the Observatory will be to improve the transfer of information inside the audiovisual industry and promote a clearer vision of the market, #as well as a greater transparency.
*Me Explain: it is a reality that #a lot of structures and organisations finish remaining attached to his *financiador public, and this situation *les tends to move away of his goal, that in this case is the public service and the attention to the professionals of the audiovisual sector.
Report (To5-0024/1999) of the Mr. *Gargani, in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the proposal of decision of the Council [*COM(1999)0111 - *C5-0019/1999 - 1996/0066(*CNS)] relative to the community participation in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector
Is a question of principles that #all the women and the groups that take campaign in his favour enjoy of equal access to the community bottoms, especially *cuando his purpose consists in allowing that the #european organisations are represented in the UN.
*Felizmente For the European Parliament the ridiculous do not kills, since it #would have to have reported clearly the attitude of the direction of *Michelin, that finishes to announce a massive reduction of effective and dismissals, although the results and benefits of this company have increased considerably!
Regarding the *segunda splits of the proposal, that establishes the terms under the *cuales a transport #can be considered transport *ad *hoc, #as well as the procedure for the acceptance of the derogations, by it that to me *respecta, approve and adopt the proposal of the Commission, more severe, definitely, that the today valid legislation.
The security in the transport always has been #one of the great worries of this Parliament, independently of the means used, although, obviously, the transport of commodities dangerous occupy to this *respecto a central place.
To my mood to see is precisely in these fields #where our Parliament and the #european politics win in credibility, because of how serve the national rules -for example regarding the transport of commodities dangerous by road- *cuando need rules to #european level?
It do not takes fault that convince to the citizens of the need of a common politics of environment neither of the need of a politics of security #european in the terrain of the dangerous commodities.
And, in this moment, take a special call so that the #finnish Presidency carry out in the next Council the Regulation *IFOP and the Commission, gentleman *Fischler, was flexible in this text for *acercarse to the positions of the European Parliament.
We want to, on the other hand, *Señorías, a fast negotiation and want to that, anyway, there #be a significant economic support and sufficient for #all the sector affected -*armadores and workers- in front of a hypothetical transitory period in that it was not in vigour the right to fish in those waters.
A verbal war about #which are the most innocuous foods in *Europa will have an only result: the destruction of the confidence of the consumers in the foods *provenientes of *Europa, was *cual was the place of production.
In front of these *interrogantes fundamental, as in the case of the *OGM, #would have to impose, as, the greatest prudence, with greater reason put that very *próximamente go to have of an effective scientific instrument, the proofs *EEB, that *nos will allow to judge the sanitary state of the group of the herds.
This type of contradiction among the national right and the community right exists also in the field of the hunting and in #many other fields, as #if the governments signed abstract #european commitments #whose aberrant practical consequences discovered afterwards.
Nevertheless, the animals injured and patients that die in the stables get to the industrial facilities, and the tallow of these animals gets to the pharmaceutical industry, to the industry of the cosmetics and, therefore, to the alimentary chain.
How doubt fits that the financial compensation is an important support, but, besides, the presence of the #european fleet contributes to give a greater feeling of stability in the area, it that only #can be beneficial for the international relations with *Angola.
I have taken note with interest and already have received with satisfaction the statement taken by the #french Minister of Trade and Protection of the Consumer, Mrs. *Lebranchu, that, referring this weekend to the unanimous report of the Managerial Committee Scientist, said that it #would reassure to the consumers.
From the year 2003 #all the meat of bovine will carry a labeling with the place of birth, the place of fatten, the place of sacrifice, the race and the age of the animal.
#If to *ello join the availability of capacity installed, that #can increase given the high potential propensity to the investment, consequence of his high profitability, will produce  structural changes, that the managers of the economic politics have to take in consideration to adopt his respective decisions.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, first of all, *yo want to manifest that our Group receives with satisfaction the dialogue *macroeconómico like a #worthy innovation of *encomio, since it involves for the first time to #all the main protagonists of the #european economic politics and *les engages to a direct exchange of opinions on the general frame of economic conditions.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, believe that #if the millions of unemployed #european had listened this first statement on the dialogue *macroeconómico to boost the growth and the employment, #would have carried  the hands in command.
I am #one of the persons that, to the equal that #Stephen *Hughes, had wanted to take part the past Friday and, likewise, had wanted to follow the debate with the Central Bank on the increase of the types of interest.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the gentleman President of the Council has used the image of the career of reliefs to signal that the goal of the dialogue *macroeconómico is to happen the witness to the following runner.
#Any of the that take part in the dialogue, neither the Council, neither the Commission, neither the Central Bank European, will have to answer directly #if they do not take  effective some #european solutions; only to those who have been chosen and occupy these seats *nos will demand direct responsibilities the constituents and constituents that *nos have voted.
*Eso Poses a danger, the truth, poses a danger for the review of the general directive, of the that also is  occupying the Mrs. *Smet, and is the following: the rail sector goes included in the directive.
Of course, the responsibility of this situation the have the politics of the governments that protect the uncontrolled action of the capital shipowner that, of multiple ways, forces to the crew to work *duramente, in conditions *excepcionalmente dangerous, many times *rebasando the limits of the human resistance.
I do not see, the truth, how #can supervise  satisfactorily this measure, because the community ports and the countries of the European Community do not have real jurisdiction on the fuselages of pavilion or foreign property.
#If it goes out forward, #if, for example, it had agreed  that it was possible some supervision, do not fits doubt that they did not go to have some labour day out of the waters and the ports of the European Community and afterwards *cambiarla *cuando found  inside our geographic zone.
Of course, the relative questions to the health and the security are an important reason to limit the labour day, but the fishing already is object of codes of practices and regulations supervised by the competent authorities.
The maximum labour day volunteer negotiated by the #irish medical organisation and our department of health is 35 hours to the week by half term in turns of 46 hours and no more of 72 hours of continuous work.
No only it takes already *algún time that exists in Big *Bretaña this plan of advertising of the data on the saving of fuel, but that, besides, the majority of the citizens take for granted that the valid plan is consequence of a #european directive.
Gentleman President, in the first place, wish to express my more alive satisfaction by this initiative, that constitutes undoubtedly an important step to the informative transparency regarding the environmental characteristics of the car and that goes, in this sense, to facilitate the election of the consumer.
We have to appreciate to the Council -the truth is that this time do not say it only jokingly- that it have suppressed #some of the requests formulated by the Parliament in the first reading, that surely incorporated  because of the hastes and that neither had my approval.
Another type of measures no legislative that they #can base and reinforce the juridical frame is the *autorregulación, or better said, an approach in the that the regulation and the *autorregulación are integrated, is to say in the that they appear #a lot of looks regulated in the legislation and, besides, distinct groups of sectors interested in reaching solutions by means of the mutual query.
It exists the fear that the electronic trade was *estrangulado when being born by regulations that subject in power to the dealers to 15 #european jurisdictions different, but do not offer to our citizens an easy and affordable access to the justice.
#This is a clear indication that it still remains #a lot of path for visiting in the field of the liberalisation of the postal services or at least shows that there #be determined companies of the sector that do not apply this liberalisation as it is had to.
We wish intelligent models of work, like the factory *desahogada, in the *cual configures  the time of work according to the level of employment, in the majority of the times shortens , but no always, instead of shortening unilaterally the time of work with a full *nivelación *salarial.
And when hearing talk to the previous orator, the Mrs. *Theorin, have to say that I am conscious that the speaker has encouraged  for incorporating the greater number of possible amendments. Without embargo, no longer have to  include in a report #all the amendments as they present , saying two or three times it same.
It is #this the reason by the that pretend to establish in the same body of the guidelines in matter of employment a bond among the creation of new opportunities for the unemployed and new places of work, by a part, and the quality of these places and the social protection, by #another.
On the other hand, the hit of the politics of employment is fundamental of face to a healthy development of the public finances and is logical to see the package on the employment and the cooperation *macroeconómica in the community context.
And in *ellas even reduces  the active support to the local initiatives of employment and leaves  to a side any attempt to examine the quality and the sustainability of the places of work created.
To the not evaluating seriously the sustainability and the quality of the growth, runs  the risk of *subestimar the work that still remain for taking to confer a social character to the #european construction.
Never I have understood very well how it pretends  say *cuando takes  reference to an employment with social content, but, on the other hand, know that it is not possible a perspective of assessment of the employment based in the reduction of the protections and of the fundamental goals of social cohesion.
Nevertheless, we do not accept a key conclusion on the only coin, that says that it is a fact that the realisation of the economic and monetary union creates a favourable climate for the apparition of new places of work.
Beside the evident fact that it is very important that the Union have already, as #one of his goals, a high level of employment and of social protection, see that the data show still a *gap enormous among the contributions made and the needs of the that suffer in his families and personally the *lacra of the unemployment.
The qualitative elements of this type constitute the heart of our social model. In this sense will have to give  form to the minimum requirements of protection and to the grade of reduction of the sectors submerged.
I create, therefore, that the Mr. *Menrad has reason *cuando in the general conclusions takes upsetting in the need that the Commission harmonise the documents on the fundamental guidelines of the economic politics and on the guidelines for the employment.
I believe that we #can be more optimistic and *plantearnos objective common Europeans in the field of the information, because we #can not talk of convergence of the States members #if it do not gives  the convergence in a so delicate field like the of the society of the information.
In our country the communists are struggling after the fast approval of the law on the #sindical representation that also is an act of democracy in the centres of work.
Improve the professional insertion, develop the business initiative, boost the capacity of adaptation of the companies and of his workers, reinforce the equality of opportunities among women and men; #this are the main *pilares of this politics.
To the 25 years, have, as it says , "#all the life by in front" , but without any possibility to conceive a project of life, without #any another perspective that the unemployment and the minimum income of subsistence, is not worse that a conviction to death?
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, treats  here of a project of directive in the frame of the program Car *Oil, that has by goal improve of here to the year 2010 the quality of the air by means of the reduction of the broadcasts of gas pertinent of the vehicles to engine.
These vehicles found  in a neutral concept of fuel and technology, based in the best available technology, that will allow to the States members or to the local authorities boost the use of the vehicles that answer to the idea *EEV by means of fiscal incentives.
The violence is a social problem of regrettable actuality that supposes a rape of the human rights and an attempt to the health in the physical looks, mental and social, and to the quality of life.
In *Portugal, for example, the violence against the women is *estadísticamente greater in the municipalities with greater levels of life or greater cultural levels, it that do not means necessarily that in *ellos there #be more violence against the boys and the women; it means -in my opinion- that there #be more women with financial independence, with more culture and more value to present complaints to the police.
To *través of the program *STOP and of the work in the fields of the police and of the judicial cooperation, the Commission struggles actively against the sexual exploitation of the boys, included the childish pornography in Internet.
The predominant approach of the Treaty centres  in the citizen like worker, it that means that the interests of the boys are not contemplated, as *ellos are not more that the group addressee of a program of action and some #few eventual budgetary lines.
With seen to the editorial of the Letter of the Fundamental Rights, and to the creation of the common space of freedom, security and justice have to include a special chapter on the protection of the rights of the boys.
I believe that we are in front of a problem that #can analyse  from two points of sight: by a part, the of the fundamental rights and, by #another, the of the influence of the relative politics to the boys in the sectors of action of the Union.
Sure enough, it is a secret to voices that the #british Government was convinced only by means of the promise to save caution in the directive on the information and query during a year regarding the anonymous society European with some minimum rights of copartnership.
#If we accept immediately the amendments and go to the table of negotiations with the new proposal, go in in the process of the unanimity, that already know from the principle, that as they go the things, do not goes to have the results that want.
The decision of resources own that today argue, that is the mere translation by part of the Commission of the political decision of the European Council, is the best proof of this shrinking.
#If we examine the cases of *Holanda and *Alemania, in #whose name there #be had *tantas complaints in this Parliament, see that the Only Market *les has contributed immense benefits and have had balances extraordinarily positive in his trade with the rest of the Union along the years.
In *tercer place, the put in practice of the principle of flexibility inside some limits for the agricultural costs, proposing the transfers to the following budgetary exercise of the costs or of the no used resources.
As I have said, in general I consider a positive evolution that, because of the evolution of the market and of the prices in the agricultural sector, have been necessary less credits and that have had to  spend less bottoms that then #can  devote to programs of external politics of big importance and urgency, #such as the that have proposed here.
The Union has fixed already #some dip clear in the energetic sphere to reduce the broadcasts of CO2 in a 8% around the middle of the next decade and, of course, duplicate the contribution of the sources of energy renewable of the 6% current to the 12% in 2010.
As I #be to repeat often, we have to begin giving example precisely from the public facilities, from the public buildings, from the public sector and of the institutions of the utilisation of the energy of a more effective way and more rational.
I expect that the #nordic convention was able to continue advance and support #the same goals, but then will need also the explanations that there was in the report of the Commission of Subjects Juridical about this proposal.
Regarding the amendment *nº 5, *nos seems that it takes *recaer an excessively weighed charge on the central authorities in the frame of a system of the directive in the that said central authorities have a purely subsidiary function.
I believe that #all suit in that regarding the nuclear head offices and to the nuclear facilities is absolutely essential that concede  the maximum priority to the security: the security of the operations, the security of the construction and of the design.
It is precisely not to penalise to the States members that #can present his proposals in a more precocious stage and in an acceptable form, of compliance with the disposals of the regulation, that the Commission decided to approve the list by group of country.
Nevertheless, it wanted to reassure to the gentlemen deputies that #can be concerned, *precisándoles that the activity of the investments on the terrain will not see  interrupted, since the relative resources to the current period, that still do not finishes , have to be *integralmente delivered before 31 December 1999.
In the dramatic circumstances like the that affected, takes some years, to *Portugal and #Italia and, more recently, to #Grecia, #where have been in two occasions, especially with our colleague #Anna *Diamantopoulou, takes a month and afterwards takes hardly some days, *nos support on #the same general regulation of the Structural Bottoms and are responsible.
Our main worry, in addition to continuing in this line, is the to give fulfillment to the decision of the European Council of *Tampere, to find definitions, *incriminaciones and common sanctions for the offences of traffic of human beings and abuse against the boys.
I believe that this new approach on the coordination of the inner politics and of the external politics, and of the programs that commission  of #one and of #others, #can be a step forward very positive in the action of the Union in these matters.
To his time, the efforts of the Union to this *respecto *incidirán significantly in the possibilities of the countries candidates to reach said modernisation and, therefore, also in our common interest to reach an effective enlargement it before possible.
The past days 28 and 29 October *me displaced to *Kosovo together with the Commissioner #Chris *Patten, it that *nos provided the opportunity of *reunirnos with #all the political leaders of both communities #as well as with the representatives of the mission of the Nations Joined in *Kosovo and also of the international strength of security for *Kosovo, the *KFOR.
*Señorías, in the middle of this spectrum, of this range, have to take an effort for improving those instruments of protection of the citizens and of fulfillment of the law, is to say, the police instruments, #whose need *imperiosa has put  of self-evident in the last crises.
We have to be able to act of autonomous way and is necessary that believe the necessary conditions for *ello, in the field of the means of transport, of the communications, of the #obtaining of information, of the modern satellites.
The real challenge that  unseen behind the *Europa of the defence is the access to the nuclear weapon or, in his defect, the disappearance to fixed term of the #french nuclear deterrence that, as it knows #everyone, exists *cuando do not shares .
By #this, is necessary to procure that in the Conference *Intergubernamental incorporate  the article 5 of the Treaty of the *UEO to the Treaty of the EU under the form of a protocol to the that #can adhere #all the countries on the base of his own sovereign decision.
In the Treaty of *Amsterdam creates  a cell of #alert early that has like goal be attentive to it that it #can occur to treat to avert that it occur and not having to act neither military neither collectively #if we are able to take all it possible by the diplomatic road, by the road of the prevention.
On the other hand, it is precise that in the negotiations of the *OMC put  of self-evident and take  in consideration likewise the commitments subscribed by the Union in the frame of other international agreements, like the of the World-wide Organisation of the Health or of the International Organisation of the Work.
Also we have to keep, besides, a permanent dialogue with the Government, the Congress and the village of the States Joined, that clear our reasons and boost the mutual acceptance of a reasonable balance of interests with our partner.
. (IN) Gentleman President, wanted to express my gratitude to the Mr. *Schwaiger for having elaborated an extremely complex report and, in particular, to *Erica *Mann also, for having coordinated big part of the work in the preparation of the amendments to the report.
Thus, our Group believes that before *nos hurl of head to new commercial rounds in *Seattle need to take an exhaustive evaluation of the social and environmental repercussions of the liberalisation that already has taken place as a result of the last commercial negotiations in the Round *Uruguay.
In this resolution, that do not doubt will receive tomorrow a massive support of our colleagues, add our voices to the of the Council to condemn the action in course and ask that it initiate  a negotiation without more delay with the representatives chosen of the population *chechena.
Already they know *ustedes that the #european agriculturalists will have to take important efforts of adaptation to apply the commitment of *Berlín that has represented, the past month of March, the point of balance acceptable for the fifteen States members of the European Union.
#This goes to be increasingly fundamental in our future, of #the same mood that it is necessary to highlight the importance of the agriculture in the field of each economy protecting with suitable rules - and #this remains patent in the report, although it is necessary that each #one of *nosotros back it increasingly and with strength - the small and medium enterprise.
#If we achieve to respect these bonds and improve the quality of life with a sustainable development so much in economic terms as in environmental terms, surely will have seated the bases of a better society in the new #millenium.
The unavoidable globalisation of the market #can not suppose a discount of our alimentary security neither of the social rights of our workers, neither #can suppose neither the forget of our more disadvantaged regions.
The *mercantilización of the services, even of the education, the health and the culture, pursues the goal to snatch to the working class and to the villages in general #many of his conquests of these last one hundred years.
Likewise, the recognised prerogative of the States in this political #would have to translate also in the possibility, for these last, of his application differentiated in the internal territory, of it contrary -further of the simplification of the procedures- the only condition #would follow being the flexibility of the work.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0058/1999) of the Gentlemen *Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on the preparation of the reform of the Treaties and the next Conference *Intergubernamental (*C5-0143/1999 - 1999/2135(*COS)).
The common market European has generated a competition among the systems in this look, that in the case of the tax on the value added, for example, has determined an approximation of the types *impositivos.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, share the conviction that, with the next enlargement to the *Europa of the East, the Union #can follow creating the conditions for a mutual enrichment of the States, instead of comporting the ruin of #one to favour better the fortune of #others.
The current Treaties contain numerous different - cases protocols, parts of the Treaty of the European Community of the Coal and of the Steel, for example - that they are susceptible to be amended by means of the procedure simplified, and the *CIG #would have to analyse this look from a constructive optics.
In #this see a significant confirmation of these orientations *europeístas shared that historically they have characterised the European Parliament in the relation with the other community Institutions, the national parliaments and the public opinion.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam established the legitimacy of some forms of cooperation among the States members, inside the institutional frame of the Union, to surpass the level of integration already reached.
It do not considers the Council that the European Union #would have to suspend his own financial help to the "#taliban project" and initiate a deep investigation on the efficiency and the correct management of the bottoms allocated to the *PNUCD?
Without embargo, repeat that the competent organs of the Council are studying the mood to improve the possibilities of the public to know the documents, so that #all are accessible to the public in Internet, except the confidential.
Council. (*FI) Gentleman President, want to signal that it is a fact that *Turquía has adopted measures, also during the year in course, allocated to improve the human rights, but the truth is that, in this look, still *le remains a long path that visit, and the changes do not produce  quickly in any society.
The expression «Oil for the democracy» shows by himself/hisself *sóla that to the #serbian village  *le is taking a blackmail without precedents: #if it wants oil for the heating, #if it wants to heat, this village has to accept the conceptions of the European Union on the democracy.
In the Parliament obtained the unanimous support of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional the first time that examined , and the first time that examine it here each #one of the main political Groups took to know that it supported the proposal.
#If #this approves  today here, and the *crispación diminishes, #would owe perhaps have the value to examine #if, in the achievement of a just end, to know, the inclusion of the members of parliament in the mechanisms of control, #can guarantee the free mandate and perhaps articulate it of distinct form.
Also we will have the possibility to work together with other #european institutions in the organisation of a conference *interinstitucional that examine the application of the strategy of the European Union in matter of drugs, probably at the beginning of the year that comes.
Second, because the own regulation - and *me gives shame say it - excludes of scandalous way, to instance of the socialist "government-communist-environmentalist" of my country, the storage of impressions *dactilares of the illegal immigrants controlled in the territory of the Union.
And, without embargo, results that they are the main victims of the change of date because the rich countries of the North *les have left his old computer squads that are not prepared for the change of #millenium.
Consistently with this wish, *cuando in first reading adopt a position regarding the budget for the year 2000, established a specific line of character *plurianual and endowed with 30 millions of euros allocated to the reconstruction of *Timor Oriental, amount that has to update  to the light of the information provided by the conjoint mission of evaluation.
There #be had in this case #all a series of coincidences that have originated in our country a deep movement of solidarity to the that, of course, have adhered  the Government, #all the political parties and the rest of the society.
Gentleman President, by *enésima time our Parliament expresses his rejection by the fact of keep  to scale world-wide the use of methods of anachronistic punishment, *antidemocráticos and of doubtful effectiveness, and precisely in countries like the States Joined, that lately *enarbola as own the flag of the defence of the human rights.
Thus, with the foundation of our #european values, and in name of the respect to the human rights, lick to the governments of #all the countries with pending executions to that the revoke immediately and to that they proceed to the abolition of the pity of death.
We have supported the process of peace by means of the finance of the negotiations that take place in *Arusha, with a contribution of two millions of euros, that, of far, is the most important, and that it #would have to suffice, together with other external finances, so that the negotiations get to a result.
This model admits the shops of drugs, that in our country know  unfairly with the #english name of "*coffeeshops", and part of a difference among soft drugs, the marijuana, and hard drugs like the heroine or the ecstasy.
In accordance with this article, the Union #can complement the national politics with measures directed to the improvement of the public health, to the prevention, #as well as to reduce the damage caused by the drugs to the health.
I agree with the amendments proposed by the Mrs. *Rühle, that express clear and real worries about the transparency, the efficiency and the surrender of accounts of the *BEI and about his compliance with the goals and the politics of the Community.
By this reason the Commission always has *margen to pose this possibility of increase of the Bottom of reservation, although we do not have the feeling of that it was necessary to take it in the current moment.
. Gentleman President, the Commission has presented a proposal of regulation to modify another community regulation, the Regulation (*CEE) *nº 1911/91, that established the special juridical diet for the Canarian islands.
. (IN) The regulation of the Council of 29 June 1998 stipulates that: "The Commission will present to the Council a report regulate on the situation of the market and will evaluate #if the #european dockyards see  affected by practices *anticompetitivas.
Besides, the Commission proposes now forbid #all renewal in the segments that do not progress to #the same rhythm that the other and force to find and to destroy a capacity a 30% upper to the of ships renewed in the segments that are to the day in the goals of the POP.
Like Basque, want, with humble and simple voice but firm, move to the European Parliament the feeling of failure of a hope of peace that the #spanish society and especially the Basque have housed during #all this time.
Have also to a delegation of the parliament *estonio, headed by his president, Mr. *Tunne *Kelam, and wanted to signal the paper that exerts the Mixed Parliamentary Commission in the negotiations in course that have to conclude, also in this case, with the adhesion to the European Union.
I have to say that the Table of the Parliament has adopted this morning, in his meeting, the necessary measures to watch by the ideal application of the disposals of the before mentioned resolution.
But #if the money collected is distributed to the clubs that commission  of the education, of the training of the youngsters, the action of interest collective allows an exemption of the norm of the competition.
#If we do not fulfil with our duty to elaborate a #european directive for the protection of the sportsmen, included the professionals, will not struggle against the roots and the causes of the doping.
At present, the fiscal package European crosses grave difficulties, without embargo, said package no only represents an important initiative to struggle against the hurtful competition in the fiscal field, but also an essential element for our strategy for the employment.
But going back to the position of the Parliament -that believe that it is a very balanced position- in relation with the Conference *Intergubernamental, *yo *le #would say to the Council that do not take an approach of flight low in this question.
Without embargo, did not ask  to the citizens and #this is my council of face to this governmental conference before it set up the construction of the empire: they ask to the #european citizens #if they wish that the evolution follow this path.
The #european competitiveness neither is now optimum, the community markets do not work of the form owed and has detained  the *nivelación of prices of the sakes of consumption among the States members in the zone of the *UEM.
It follows being missing a public debate in these countries and a social dialogue, a participation of the regional and local field. All #this, that among *nosotros takes for granted, #can not take place there because the instruments of the EU do not allow it.
Nevertheless, also we know that the no military means and the diplomatic means often only have a real effect #if it exists a credible military threat in a flat second.
*Yo Wanted to signal that in the provisional report of the Commission on the Czech Republic quoted  a #czech city of half size #where has built  a fence in a street, by means of the *cual the Czechs keep  separated of the #gipsy.
I believe that in January will be able to  and will have to begin  because have in wallet #a lot of subjects: *Amsterdam, the fringes of *Amsterdam, the cohesion, the *codecisión, the subject of the security and the defence, the Letter of rights fundamental, #as well as the reform of the Treaty.
I suppose that this subject interests to the #finnish Government, but although I have posed this question in front of a member of the Ministry of Subjects External Finn, follow without obtaining any information and the man will be judged today and morning.
His trial Is celebrating  in *Rusia, and already a lot before undertaking  the judicial process, the European Union took a call so that the person in question have a suitable trial that fulfil with the rule.
Also I have read with I like that the Speaker #Nicole *Fontaine reacted *prontamente in front of the confirmation of this sentence and also that #would take part in front of the president of the Big National Assembly of *Turquía so that #this did not confirm the execution of the pity of death.
Deny the financial helps proposals by the Commission for the next three years and for the *potenciación of the Union *Aduanera #would mean, especially in this dramatic moment that sees the #mediterranean country *postrado owing to a catastrophic earthquake, contribute to increase in *Turquía a perverse spiral, #whose consequences are *inimaginables.
The Commission coincides with the Commission of Environment in that the conditions of the enclosed spaces *repercuten seriously on the health, but do not believe that this proposal was the vehicle to study how have to resolve this problem.
For *ello, will suit that we remember by a moment why have this directive on the table and of course is not by the taste to collect #some data -already collect  sufficient-, but that the reason is that it reached  a voluntary commitment with the manufacturers of cars.
In the *segunda splits of the foundation mentions  to the second and to the *tercer *pilar in the strategy for the dioxide of carbon and the tourisms, is to say, to the information to the consumers and to the use of measures fiscal.
I believe that it #would be positive, and also have posed it in the commission, even have sent a letter asking why #can not use #the same signal, #the same signal of warning, the *pictografía that uses  in the world of the international transport.
Like speaker, #would agree with the amendment 23, #if to the introductory part, that is object of this amendment,  *le add three words: Then the amendment #would remain as it follows: " special climatic conditions of some alpine zones or of comparable zones to the #mediterranean and #nordic regions" .
The present proposal has like goal update the current relative legislation to the commercialisation of materials forest of reproduction to take into account the entry of new States members from 1975, the inner market and the scientific advances.
It proposes that  *le assign to *Portugal, to effects of calculation, a supplementary quantity of 83.468 tonnes for the campaign 1999-2000 and, for the campaign 2001, the difference among the quota reckoned by the really transformed quantity in 1997-1998 and the reckoned when substituting this quantity by 884 592 tonnes.
Gentleman President, the current common organisation of markets had given samples of exhaustion, since it was not able to answer to the new challenges of a market like the of the products *pesqueros, very *globalizado and competitive, in a European Union very dependent of the imports.
I give the thanks to my colleagues, to the civil servants of the Commission of Fishing and to the of the Commission by his help in the preparation of this report and want to congratulate to the Mrs. *Fraga *Estévez by the presentation of his very wide report.
And as they still are pending questions like the pity of death, and in concrete the of the leader *kurdo *Ocalan, #would wish to ask the return of both reports to commission, with the end that the Government of *Turquía give a positive signal in front of the European Union.
Now well, the resolution, that, in the article 3, pretends to situate the security and the health of the workers by on "of considerations of character purely economic", contradicts  to himself/hisself same in the article 2, when denying  to "impose obligations... [That]  *opondrían to the creation and to the development of small and medium enterprises".
This explanation of vote do not alters the posture that have shown previously as a result of the processing by the European Parliament of the report of the Gentlemen *Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen on the *preparativos of the next governmental conference.
In effect, the transitory period of three years will have had, at least, the merit of *demostrarnos that #can live  very well, on the one hand, with a euro with own life -that, besides, is rather chaotic in the international markets- and, on the other hand, with some national coins that follow in circulation, for greater satisfaction of the consumers.
Gentleman President have voted against of the Inform Towers Mark relative to the introduction of the euro, because my party, the Socialist Party of the Low Countries, always has been contrary to the introduction of a community coin.
Therefore today, to the equal that the Council *Ecofin of the European Commission and that #ours speaker, think that the reduction of the transitory period of three years #can arouse technical difficulties very important, that #would put in danger the process of the step without setbacks to the euro.
The dynamic performance of the Commission in narrow cooperation with the delegation of the European Parliament has put of self-evident that the Commission with his complete strategy of negotiation had tended the rails that #would conduct to a possible hit.
Although it is fundamental to centre in the details of procedure, any improvement of the organisation will compensate the greater loss of *Seattle, the loss of conviction political in the merits of a liberalisation of the trade opened and based in disposals *multilaterales.
Finally, the members of the *OMC owe at last listen to the 1.200 no governmental organisations of almost 100 countries that have signed a statement demanding that it do not follow  advance with the liberalisation until they examine  the social and environmental repercussions of the current liberalisation and solve  the problems.
As very well it has explained the Mrs. *Pack in his intervention, have got to an agreement that, for #all *nosotros -and like this have said it clearly the members of parliament-, is an angular stone in the construction of a *Europa of the citizens.
The next legislative initiative #can *atañer once again to the sector of the insurances, in particular to #any forms of harmonisation of the relative norms to the compensation of the damage to the person that *tantas disparities and *tantas injustices is creating in the European Union.
*Cuando Think that only the 30% of the transport of fuels passes *circunvalando Swiss, then have to take use of the contingents to go back to apply the shortest path possible in place to load in excess to the peripheral countries further of any statistics.
This substance, used like *desinfectante agricultural mainly in zones very delimited of crops of #mediterranean regions, has already a commercialisation and utilisation severely restricted in my country and has been already substituted in #all the cases in that it has tested  the existence of alternatives suitable.
The amendment 27 #would introduce a procedure accelerated to include in the new rule substances that exhaust the coat of ozone, it that it #would be of utility to postpone investments little careful, to the time that benefits to the coat of ozone.
In fact, the members of the commission consider that in these moments the European Union is focusing the subject of the genetically modified foods of a quite garbled way.
Because, I ensure it , my opinion is that the heel of #Achilles of the regulation, that besides believe that it opens the doors to the legal adulteration, to the transgression and to the distortion, is that it is not possible to define in compound foods how and how much contain of a product altered genetically.
Thus *me amazes that it say  that the lady Commissioner *Wallström do not wishes to expect to the definite review and that in his place has backed the offer of the industry to fulfil the review of the directive on *OGM, already before his approval.
With the proposal of amendment of the Regulation *nº 1139/98, by the that it establishes  some minimum limits of the adventitious content of material *GM authorised, answer to the mandate of the Council on the labeling of the alimentary products produced from *OGM.
*Me Cheer that the European Council have fixed the great lines of the new #european politics of security and defence developing, in particular, the military and no military capacities of fast intervention of the Union.
Collecting the wishes of the Parliament, also will comment the opinions of the Presidency on the situation of *Chechenia and will review the most important results of the summit of the *OSCE celebrated in *Estambul in the month of November.
Among the challenges that have by in front find  the demographic changes and the increase of the competition originated by the globalisation, of the *cuales derives  the need to boost the innovation and the structural reform.
How it has escaped  of the control of the Union the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, that acts like doctor and supervisor of the illnesses of the sport, on the that presented a report the 1.12. The Commissioner, Mrs. *Viviane *Reding, and in the that the Union had to exert an important paper?
We will not be able to prevent the every time greater inequality among the citizens and among the societies, #if we are not able to regulate the minimum taxes in #all the zone of the internal market.
I seat a cultural community much stronger with the Turkish and the *kurdos progressive that struggle in favour of the justice, the freedom and the democracy. And it is for me reason of joy that a day  *les #can give the welcome to a community of cooperation #european.
In this question reached  reach the goal that the #finnish Presidency had fixed , to know: already in the Conference celebrated previously in *Helsinki, the States members and the countries associated agreed in that it is necessary to trace a plan of action.
The example of the *OMC has shown that the #european chains #can have had an a lot greater presence and that it is important that are in the first line of the informative coverage #if we want to exert a paper leader in the world.
It do not considers the Commission that the companies in question use the offer to make new dramas of infrastructure to protect his monopoly and that said dramas #would contravene the political favourable European to a balance more *ponderado among the distinct means of transport?
But it wanted to add it following: by #a lot of that it invest  in infrastructures -and in the conference of donors that will celebrate  to beginnings of the new year will examine the concrete promises-, by #a lot of that it spend  in infrastructures, it decisive is to boost a more wide and free trade among the countries of this region and even inside #one or two countries of this region.
To #the same time, the Commission will follow accompanying the process of reforms political and economic in this country according to the valid agreement of cooperation and by means of the program *PHARE or the new financial instrument that *substituirá to *PHARE.
In conclusion, gentleman President, the Commission do not considers that the new politics in matter of vertical restrictions #can cause in the sector of the beer and in the sector of the hospitality industry in *Bélgica important structural changes that put in danger the culture of the beer in this country.
It treats  of small and medium enterprises that, with a high level of efficiency, require so #few employees that fulfil the criteria of the EU for the granting of helps state to the #SME, but that, to #the same time, #can compete in inequality of conditions and cause a distortion of the competition in the market.
Little satisfactory because -as also it has seen  in the Summit of *Helsinki- have a Council that takes promises with a big joy and afterwards the budgetary authority, of the *cual in any case also forms part the Council, has to look for the way that all go back to square.
The European Council of *Berlín obsessed  with the budgetary cuts, no only initiated the decline of the endowment of the structural politics with regard to the levels reached in 1999, but that forgot that there were other community politics.
The already poor countries of the region are even more poor, the conditions of life of his population see  aggravated and the bombs have not put end to the opposite chauvinisms.
Gentleman President, to measure that expand  the competitions of the European Union also grows the importance of the Court of Accounts European, that from the Treaty of *Maastricht is an autonomous organ of the Community.
The facts of the past year highlight the need that have an able Court to criticise in necessary case so much to the Commission as to the States members that, after all, are responsible of the management of the 85% of the resources, roughly.
Nevertheless, we know that it is in some compulsory mood for the European Union, according to the Convention on the Rights of the Boy of the Nations Joined, that the Commissioner was in conditions to inform about it that is taking  in favour of the boys.
The process of harmonisation has the purpose to reach the most elevated levels of security and of environmental protection and represents an important inducement of face to the quality, with advantages so much for the industry as for the consumers.
The norms established in the Parallel Agreement coincide with the of the Agreement *UNECE, without embargo foresees  a procedure of taking of specific decisions *cuando a project of regulation do not examines  in the frame of the agreement of 1958.
Two weeks ago we celebrate here a symposium with varied #american congressmen in the that it debated  of way detailed this question, or was, the preparation of a common philosophy based in the economic and ecological requirements with seen to the harmonisation of the technical norms.
#This *me carries to a very important subject that the Parliament also has posed in a resolution, to know, the question of the nuclear energy like option for the projects of mechanisms of development no *contaminantes.
I appreciate the commitment of the Parliament to help to spread the importance of the fight against the climatic change in #all *Europa and among his homologous of other countries, in particular the Congress of the States Joined.
Therefore, in the Commission of Environment, follow proposing the renewable energies and that adopt  clear measures in the transport; no only in the transport by road that is the that more broadcasts of CO2 produce, but also in the aerial transport that also generates #a lot of broadcasts and, up to now, has not priced  as it had to .
#Such as it signals  in the resolution, believe that it has got the hour that the EU show the path to follow and that  *atreva to be in the avant-garde, that leave after yes to #EE.UU., with his fault of will and with his *inflexibilidad, and that ratify the Agreement of *Kioto beside other countries.
#This affects, especially, to the contingents of the trade of waste and material *contaminantes, the *cual is a half effective to reduce the wastes *contaminantes, always that it regulate  for this trade a clear rule based in the mechanisms of the economy of market.
We will need the collaboration and help of the industry to go out advance and will require  also the initiatives of the citizens, in #all the countries members, to obtain the strength and the necessary support for the adoption of measures.
Therefore, I wish to manifest #all the appreciate and the applause to the here adopted positions by the representatives of the Presidency of the Commission and *sumarme of #all heart to the homage *rendido by the Commissioner #Christopher *Patten to the Basque governor *Rocha Scallop.
*Macao Offers opportunities for the trade, for the dialogue and for the commitment, that is the mood to carry the freedom and the democracy to the communist dictatorship of the Chinese Popular Republic.
But yes it has to *preocuparnos the maintenance of the State of right, the maintenance of the public freedoms, the maintenance of the human rights, as it signals the Mr. *Watson in his valuable rectification.
#This, without embargo, will not prevent a continuous and substantive collaboration along #all this space of #time that *nos allow to the fifteen States members *confluir in common positions; and this confluence will be decisive factor so much of the content of the positions that keep as of the strength with that will explain for *impulsarlas in June.
Gentleman President, the representatives of 189 countries adopted in 1995, during the *cuarta World-wide Conference on the Woman, organised by the UN in *Beijing, a platform of action and a statement by the that the Governments participants engaged  to improve the situation of the women.
I owe *recordarles that under the #spanish Presidency of the Council the EU pronounced  with an alone voice in favour of the woman and that, thanks to this firmness, #can tackle important points in the negotiations, that afterwards remained reflected in the platform of action.
By this reason, wanted to formulate a very concrete question to the Council, and expect that the answer review #the same clarity. #Which will be the paper of the #european deputies in the next meeting of New *York, the Conference "*Beijing more 5"?
We do not pretend to formulate new goals; it that we want to it is to analyse and evaluate without *ambages the following looks. In how fields have progressed the States members, where have to put more of our part, where need more efforts so that the European Union #can achieve in New *York an improvement of the situation of the women in *Europa and in the rest of the world?
The debate will restart  -lady *Theorin, perhaps was #this his question- after the statement of the Commission and alas also after the debates of the Report *Papayannakis and of the Report *Keppelhoff-*Wiechert, but anyway will restart  before the turn of questions foreseen for the 17.30 hours.
We have proposed a mood to promote the program *TACIS that do not penalise to other countries, that allow to take a distinction among the advance of the democracy and the human rights, on the one hand, and other programs, by #another.
I create, therefore, that before adopting any measure has to  *averiguar loaning attention to the scientists and to the technicians that advance in the science continuously, #if it is correct to continue to forbid along the time determined substances and #if, on the base of the investigations made by the scientists, each step that give is really important.
The studies are particularly illustrative: the level of ozone has dropped among a 6 and a 10% in twenty years; in 1996, the hole extended  along 20 millions of *km2 during more of 40 days, and has observed  a decrease without precedents of the 46% of the coat of ozone on *Escandinavia, *Groenlandia and *Siberia.
It is not natural, is not normal, had account of it that each #one represents, in this Assembly, from the point of sight of the convictions, of the currents of ideas, that the left and the right #can not be entirely of agreement on these questions?
It put  in relation the reproductive health with the human rights, since it established  that the human rights of the woman include his right to control and decide free and responsibly in subjects related with his sexuality, is to say, also the sexual and reproductive health.
In effect, the Commission has adopted the approach of the stick and the carrot: the carrot have been the great efforts to gather to the parts and achieve that they approve a solution through the negotiation.
It That has carried to *Francia to this decision is the insufficiency of the guarantees regarding the definition and to the application of programs of medical proofs, and especially the absence of regulation in matter of labeling and of *trazabilidad in the #european plane.
On the other hand, *acaso the Commission and the Council do not continue *oponiéndose, with #a lot of reason, to the lifting of the embargo on the meat of bovine treated with hormones, pertinent of the States Joined, in spite of the *exhortaciones of the *OMC, basing in a similar reasoning to the of the #french Government?
I believe that we have to hail the efforts of dialogue that have undertaken  by #british part, from the beginning of the crisis of the "crazy cow", to improve the situation, to improve the alimentary security.
Asked by the nature of the planned investments by the company *Gardaland, the *BEI justified the impossibility to facilitate the pertinent documents invoking the confidential character of his relations with his customers.
It wanted to ask #if the Council, that is, and with reason, very concerned by the situation of the centre of *Europa, warms up also #any worry by the situation of regions like the autonomous region of the *Azores, that in this moment suffers great problems, in particular after the aerial disaster of the past weekend.
Gentleman President, with reason of the celebration in August of 1999 of the 50 anniversary of the four Agreements of Gin, the European Union took advantage of to ratify his commitment to boost the international humanitarian Right in the stage of #all the conflicts armed.
#This is the political question, independently of other questions that have to see, for example, with the human potential with the technological knowledge for affine questions, persons that have remained  without work, in relation with the laboratories of the Soviet Union and #some other questions.
The position of the Council, presented in *segunda reading, follow being feeble in this sense and, in particular, do not protects the small and medium enterprises and the craftsmanship against the inefficiency of the public device and of the excessive power of the great companies.
The proposal of the Commission of a directive on the delay of the payments comprises a group of measures to struggle against said delay in the commercial transactions in the European Community.
It seems to have agreed that #if *nosotros present amendments to the proposal of regulation of the Commission the Council will not approve the procedure simplified, to know the approval of the procedure of postponement in the frame of the *codecisión.
#If they wish it *usted and the deputies to the Parliament, #can *referirme to the questions for the that have come; #if no, it #can answer, in the measure of my possibilities, to the questions that have formulated the two previous orators on the questions posed yesterday in the Council.
And it gets the Commission on 15 November and *nos says: «we have not been able to conclude, by favour, an extension of a year.» But, it adds that *eso will take  on a new legal base, as in fact it has to take after the Treaty of *Amsterdam, according to the article 152 of the Treaty.
To end of accounts, #this were forced to create the necessary conditions for a reliable system of identification of the origin of the bovine and guarantee the correct operation of his electronic databases for 31 December of the year in course.

In this sense, owe *deplorar the fault of rigour of the commissioner commissioned of the budget, the one who, to appeal of the Commission of Budgets, resulted unable to give an estimate in figures of the necessary amounts in euros, since it took it only in dollars.
Give to the companies of the Realm Joined the security to introduce  in these markets will contribute to reach said goal, will promote the commercial relations, the growth and the employment so much in the Northwest as in #all Big *Bretaña.
Have the impression to see an institutional system that goes to the derive, unable to imagine his future, unless the Council know it without *atreverse to say it, and that seems to be prisoner of the consequences of a decision of enlargement that do not reaches to dominate.
In consequence, after a careful weighting of the situation, *me declare firmly in favour of the continuation of this embargo, as #this also supposes a signal to the #indonesian army, and expect that it was it also for the #indonesian democratic strengths, of those who suppose that they will see  reinforced by this attitude.
Gentleman President, estimated ladies and cavalier deputies: the Commission receives with satisfaction this debate and congratulates  equally by the interventions produced up to now in #the same, as they put of self-evident that the European Union is conscious of his responsibility in the evolution of Indonesian and that will follow encouraging by the establishment of a stable political order and democratic in this country.
This right is established also in the Constitution of *Kuwait, as it says the resolution, and of course is *loable that the #kuwaiti Government and the Parliament have proceeded to his implantation. Only that it has taken  of an especially unlucky form.
The case of the #afghan women *nos serves to visualise the problem of the fault of respect of the human rights that produces  each day in #all the corners of the planet and also in #ours *Europa.
In a moment in that the Christmases are  *acercando, this circumstance offers the opportunity, among the enormous quantity of rapes of the rights *humanes all over the world, to the Muslims and to the Christians to join  in front of the strengths of the sea.
Our intervention #can not base in the polls of popularity of the diverse presidential candidates and with reference to the main electoral subjects in debate in a sovereign State on the *cuales go  to pronounce in brief the constituents of *Nicaragua and on the *cuales competes to *ellos, and only to *ellos, competes to pronounce.
A month afterwards, the show revealed by the descent of the waters has confirmed the proportions of the disaster -further of the human lives-, it that demands that it go back  to pose an effort of prevention.
It is necessary to achieve that the crops of reference reach what before some levels *acordes with the reality, or well begin to *reflexionar again on the foundation and the consideration of the crops of reference like compensation in front of the fall of the price of the cereals.
In place of #this, has decided in the frame of the ancient Regulation 820/97, in accordance with the article 19 of the disposals of execution, that the states have now until the 1.9.2000 the possibility to continue with the voluntary system Neither consider that #this was hit.
In consequence, the Commission has proposed to expand the validity of the Decision 96/411/*CE during other three years, introducing #some small changes, with the that it pretends , especially, or simplify the application of this plan of action or reduce the delays in the payment of the community contributions.
How posture adopts the Presidency of the EU in front of the statement of the Prime minister of a country that continues keeping in vigour the exclusion of the Democratic Party *Kurdo of the elections and is responsible of crimes without precedents against the villages that inhabit in his territory?
In the frame of the external politics and of common security, have treated  in repeated occasions and regularly the initiatives of the General Secretary of the Nations Joined, especially in the group of work pertinent of the *PESC.
On 29 December 1998, the Presidency has issued a statement in name of the European Union that supports without fetters the efforts of the Nations Joined for reaching a just and durable solution.
This decision goes to take possible a distribution ordered and to time of the necessary strengths for the execution of the plan and to #the same time goes to facilitate the daily execution of the operations of *MINURSO.
And #if the Treaties establish that, in this matter, it is necessary to progress on the base of a decision by unanimity, think that the Council will have to support the juridical norms that *nos have given *nosotros and that has given  the Council in the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
*Eso Explains surely that, in the case of some Commissioners -do not say #all-, it that the experts affirmed, to know, the loss of control of the administration, have owed  in part to the increasingly important paper of said cabinets.
Therefore, #if we want to improve the operation of the European Union and of #all the #european institutions, this improvement will depend entirely of a consistent and deep application of the principle of the subsidiariness in #all the terrains.
The European Commission, without embargo, has expressed a critical trial with regard to this first stage considering that the progresses, especially regarding the transposition of the community legislation, have been slower and more uncertain of it that it was necessary and possible take.
It is more, the tenacity and the conviction with the that *Praga has pursued his adhesion to the Atlantic Alliance underlines, #if it fits, the political conviction of the country to integrate  in the different continental structures, are #this *cuales are.
In this direction, *me seems necessary to go back to say that it is precise an institutional reform that prepare to this Union before the enlargement and, second, that is precise that the Union have the necessary means to face up to the challenge of the enlargement.
But we talk to the *respecto, by it that we have to take now it necessary so that this vision that every time takes  more reality was a palpable reality in a predictable time and in this way #can give the welcome to the villages of the *Europa central in the European Union and in the European Parliament.
The application of the environmental legislation constitutes an enormous challenge for the administrations of the countries candidates, by it that it is necessary to support from the EU these activities also by means of the training and the exchange of information.
We expect that #all the States current members have given  account and are participants in the diet of coin only before the enlargement, so that the candidates do not have any possibility of election on the particular.
The current States members already have reached, previously to the enlargement, great advantages thanks to the reforms and the efforts that have made the countries candidates with the end to fulfil the criteria that  *les has imposed.
The communication analyses #some practical questions that they are notable for the constitution of some national strategies for the adoption of the *acervo by part of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental, without anticipating  on the assignment of the pertinent bottoms of the instruments of *preadhesión.
In sectors like the of the beer, but also the of the hydrocarbons, in the that the current approach satisfies to the companies that act in the market, it is necessary to take an exception to the general regulation or opt by a specific approach by sector.
After the Council have adopted the Regulation of the Council, the Commission will present a proposal of Regulation by category for #all the vertical agreements underneath of some threshold of parts of market.
Like conclusion, and to the equal that have taken #all the other, also *yo #would wish to express my gratitude to our previous president, the Mr. *Newman, the one who has carried out an exceptional work to the hour to leave of self-evident the importance of Commission of Requests.
Gentleman President, have the intention to talk about the annex of the report of the Mr. *Newman that treats of my work like mediator of the President concerning the boys kidnapped and moved out of the country, but before that at all it wanted to *rendir homage to the Mr. *Newman.
Of course, the heart of the crisis and the reason that conducted to the resignation of the Commission are the bad economic management and the fact that it has lost  in part the control of the costs.
It #would wish to ask to the Commissioner *Monti how #this preparing the Commission this regulation with arrangement to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, since his preparation represents also an essential element to solve this institutional crisis that has caused his resignation.
Of here that of course it have to modify the section 2 of the article 3 of the Statute of the Defender of the European Village so that the Defender of the Village have full access and without barriers to #all the notable documents.
The control that, through Defender of the Village, #can exert the citizens on the operation of our administration #can not but *animarnos to work better, to correct our errors and to increase the transparency of our work.
The #another point posed by the Parliament, by his Commission of Requests and by the own Defender of the Village, refers  to the code of behaviour administrative allocated to the Institutions and to the #european organs.
In my opinion, this attitude gives samples of a big irresponsibility. This type of statements only take  by ignorance or because the Mr. *Ferber has not read neither the White Book neither the report approved in commission!
Although this report is not a legislative text, represents, in terms of politics of transport, the culmination of an intense work that covers #a lot of looks and that definitely will open the door to a legislative proposal in the future.
Among the improvements that is precise to introduce figure a regional approach of the management of the fishing, that #would cover to #all the coastal States and to #all the nations that fish in distant waters and that go to fish the tuna to the Ocean *Índico.
The Agreement on the banks of fishes, of the Nations Joined, that applies  to the tuna and to other banks of fishes extremely migratory, stipulates other conditions, with inclusion of a description detailed of the approach *cautelar.
This circumstance demands modifications in the international laws -as for example in the breast of the Nations Joined-, a possibility that has not been taken advantage of by the permanent members of the Council of Security.
Of course, it supposes #a lot of practical problems and, of course, will exist opposition, also have this experience in the Low Countries, especially #if it do not clears  that the investments and the taxes are necessary to keep the densely populated territories, *habitables and accessible.
The Commission, as I have said, already is examining these important problems in a wider frame and has engaged  to *afrontarlos adequately covering, among other things, the group of the expectations in matter of protection of the bearer.
On the other hand, the Commission already  employed in depth to follow with coherence the group of the problems related with the protection of the bearer in matter of electronic money, some problems that, obviously, trascend the problem of the repayment in himself/hisself.
I regret that the commission have not agreed with his speaker in this point, the *cual constitutes, in my opinion, a very concrete claim and very important of the #european consumers.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #would want to express first of all, in name of the Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left, our pain in front of the amplitude of this catastrophe in the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, that has caused the death of 41 persons.
It is necessary to effect an urgent diagnostic on the security in #all the tunnels and, until so much do not know  the conclusions of the investigation, it is necessary to take measures of security and of limitation of the rhythm of circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The local representatives, the associations of protection of the *emplazamiento and his inhabitants, have not expected to that they occurred these dramas to promote the cooperation *transfronteriza and give the voice of alarm.
This village follows suffering the situation created by the military Government. This time has appeared in the #news because it did not allow the entrance in *Birmania to the husband of the Mrs. *Aung Saint *Suu *Kyi, gravely ailing.
I prefer, in principle, that a same country have the responsibility to get to an arrangement regarding similar happened. Also my Group thinks that a court *ad *hoc for the genocide of *Camboya offers more guarantees of justice for the #cambodian, now that the proofs run the risk to disappear.
Gentleman President, the coup d'état in *Níger, with the murder of the President #Ibrahim *Baré *Maïnassara, has gone back to *sumir another #african country in the darkness of the military hits and of the blockade of a process, although partial, of institutional reconstruction.
The government has insisted *verbalmente, but also through the facts, his «intention to reach, for finals of the year 2002, the conditions of adhesion of the country for the adhesion to the EU».
*Yo Also am adherent that it reduce  the transport by road and boost  the use of the railway and the navigable roads. Without embargo, *me deny to accept that the car, the trucks and the buses convert  in goat *expiratorio of #all the evils had and for having.
It is indispensable the cooperation to guarantee the fundamental human rights and, therefore, also the rights of the boy; it is equally necessary to reach the efficiency of this cooperation among the countries candidates and the current States members.
Likewise, in the legislations of the countries candidates will have to guarantee  the fundamental rights so clearly that it was possible to act of a truly effective way in front of any rape of the human rights that have his origin in the violence.
Already it has celebrated  a meeting on the subject. The *Bundesrat , the house of the *länder #german, regretted deeply that the year 1999 was not designated official year of the fight against the violence against the women, since it had been #one *baza complementary important.
Gentleman President, in the page 9 of the Record takes  quotation to three successive interventions, the #mine, the of the Mr. *Fabre-*Aubrespy and the of the Mr. *Wijsenbeek, relative to the decision, important to my seem, that the modification of the competitions of the commissions vote  by simple majority.
The effect of a motion of censorship *estriba, according to the paragraph second of the article 144 of the Treaty of the European Community, in that the members of the Commission will have to renounce collectively to his charges.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0160/99) of the Gentlemen *McMahon and *Schiedermeier, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on «The citizens of the third age in the century *XXI: a life by in front».
The persons of age advanced -persons of the third age or «grey panthers», as  the flame in the States Joined; «grey power» in the Realm Joined- represent a very important part of the Community.
On the one hand it is the report -a page and average- on the informations, congresses, resolutions, requests and reports had up to now, and, by the #another, the fact that from the resolution to celebrate a conference to the that got  on 16 October 1997 until the celebration of #the same the days 1 and 2 October 1998 happened almost a year.
It ceased #all #european activity of support and the existent informative associations among the organisations of the persons of age to #european level left to be funded, it that conducted to the lethargy in a big part.
It wanted to *referirme still to a point of the resolution *concerniente to the participation of the persons of age in processes of decision, included the politicians, as it exists the tendency of *vanagloriarse to have a list of candidates #whose average of age was it more possible drop.
I regret it even more because #all have appreciated his work in this Plenary, because it is truth that treats  of a discrimination of persons greater that every time will be more numerous #if colleagues so active and *lozanos like #this do not go in already in the list of candidates.
To the contrary, are #many the that, a time *jubilados, have undertaken new tasks and projects, by not talking of #all #that that it first that have taken, a time got the hour of the retreat, has been to materialise the dreams that had come feeding during his labour life.
In #a lot of regions of *Europa and, very in particular, in the northern zone of the Low Countries, the crop of potatoes exerts a paramount paper. His disappearance #would prejudice seriously the economic situation of said regions.
But the application of this system, alas, only allows a partial compensation of the disadvantage, weakening the position of the #european industry in the world-wide market, but, likewise, in our own market.
Regarding the possibility to apply in #Venecia the exceptions contemplated in the letter *c) of the section 3 of the article 92, fits to signal that it corresponds to the States members notify the regions that each #one of the countries wishes to include in his regional map.
It do not contemplates the possibility to go back on the decisions that have adopted , especially on a decision that has not been subjected to vote, although it had obtained the backrest of the big majority of the Assembly.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0216/99) of the Mr. *Fayot, in name of the Commission of Regulation, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities, on the modification of the Annex *V of the Regulation of the European Parliament.
Finally, also there #be a third proposed -a proposal of resolution- and, in this proposal of resolution the Parliament takes his observations on the budgetary management of the Commission.
#If we want to assume the derivative responsibility of this every time greater number of persons that see  forced to resort to the atypical modalities of employment, have to reach that the work of half day and the other atypical labour activities award right to provision in matter of social security and pensions.
Therefore, they are necessary structural reforms very considerable, that has to prevent that the excessive demands of the social product by part of the state, an excessive fiscal pressure and an excessive overloads by part of the social politics and of the politics of *subvencionamiento originate problems by equal.
We use to the EU to generate the necessary conditions for the creation of companies, of new places of work and for the growth and no to suffocate with bureaucracy to the employments that need neither for *sentarnos here and believe that we #can deliver or «*palabrear» the new employments and the future possibilities in #ours *Europa.
Gentleman President, ladies and parliamentary gentlemen, before at all *permítanme *decirles that *vertebraré my intervention on the relative looks to the great orientations of the economic politics, or *GOPE; the Mr. #Mario *Monti will tackle the #another report, is to say the report *Menrad on the #european pact for the employment.
On the other hand, in the context of a better integration of the employment in the politics *macroeconómica, his speaker suggests the suppression of the current splitting among the great orientations and the lines guidelines for the employment.
It refers  to the modernisation of the social protection and of the systems *impositivos to improve the incentives and the labour opportunities for the entrance or the return to the labour market.
The Commission of Control Budgetary has made his duties and in union with the #german Presidency of the Council has reached by unanimity a common position and approved recently the pertinent agreement *interinstitucional.
In December of the year happened the majority of this Assembly *denegó the approval of the management and returned  to commission because there were problems of procedure that now have resolved , when modifying  our Regulation so that it was in accordance with the disposals of the Treaty.
Regarding the Court of Accounts, only want to say that the typical demonstration of budgetary insufficiency has been able to  resolve *favorablemente, and almost without effort, in the year 1997 thanks to the favourable evolution of the euro -of the *ecu, in that moment- concerning the coin *luxemburguesa.
By this reason, the Council and the Commission, but also the Parliament, have to take into account it that have decided in the Report *Tatsos, for example, in relation with the finance of the parties, and have to proceed of equal way in the provision of squares and in the promotions.
We pose the presentation of a motion of censorship. *Ello Carried out on 11 January by 70 pertaining deputies to #all the political groups, those who bore then convictions of #all type, especially by part of the President of the Socialist Group.
No the problem resides in that 1998 has discovered  and *yo wanted to *pedirle, gentleman *Liikanen, that communicate to his colleagues that in his day, in the summer, had a breakfast up, in the floor 7 -then #this left really with confidence and friendship- and *les took the following offer: they are *ustedes frank, *confiesennos his errors, show his failures, are had to establish commitments.
Since it is seated here the person of the Socialist Group that more *cooperativamente has carried  with *nosotros, will avert the criticism to the Socialist Group. Of it contrary #would have said *yo it following: the Socialist Group is really the #culprit of the dilemma in front of the that *nos find today.
It is extraordinarily important to try include #all these small reforms in a global financial regulation and clear in the that they formulate  clearly the functions and the committed of each #one of the *copartícipes in the execution of the budget inside the Commission, to know, the computer, the *interventor financial and the accountant.
*Ella, the Mrs. Palace, has referred  to his first intervention and to the last, but *yo want to say that, among #one and #another, the performance of the Mrs. Palace has been enormously active, competent and intelligent, and really *nos have enriched #all, #all the institutions, with the work that has come making along these five years.
The decision of the *OMC in the case of the bananas demands of *nosotros a clear regulation for the own producers and for the producers *ACP in it that *atañe to the suitable access of third countries to the market.
Neither the Commission of Subjects Social neither the Commission of Subjects Economic understand why the permission to the States members to begin an experiment no the #can give the Commission.
Finally, it that *me has surprised and disappointed a bit also, is the fact that the Commission have not remained  with the control of the evaluation, that it yield the control to the States members and of this form also the initiative for new proposals.
The opportunities to introduce radical reforms that offers this new beginning only will be able to  take advantage of fully #if the three organs involved -the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission- keep a narrow collaboration in a climate of full confidence.
There #be had five years of absolute lack, five years in that the #european Constitution has been *tabú, and now spokesmen of great groups *nos give like the fundamental element of the work of the Commission the preparation of a #european Constitution.
#This no always has been like this in the past, and the question of the commercial conflict on the imports of bananas pertinent of the countries *ACP *nos leaves a bitter flavour.
We expect of *usted a firm exercise of the prerogatives of the President of the Commission no only like guardian of the Treaties and guardian of the *acervo #european, but also a brave initiative of promotion of it that remains for completing of the institutional architecture, so as to confer really personality, identity and strength to the *Europa of after the euro.
The NATO in the first place and second #a lot of countries, but also *Europa that in the past always distinguished  in the plane of the humanitarian helps, are not to the height of the challenge that is posing  as a result of this war.
Every year, to the hour to establish the budget and the program of work, will have to examine the state of progress of the realisation of the political program that will approve with the new School.
It #would fit to signal, in my opinion, that in the future Commission is necessary also the contribution of those current commissioners that have exerted well his functions and have shown his commitment *renovador, since without his participation will not be possible to undertake said reforms with the sufficient rapidity.
The Mr. *Verheugen, in name of Council, has underlined the need of a fast procedure of takeover and, on the other hand, the Mr. *Cox, has underlined the suitability of a parliamentary debate of high level on the approval of a new Commission.
The European Pact by the Employment by himself/hisself same will not resolve this problem, but #can take a contribution and constitutes a #worthy recognition of *beneplácito by part of the States members that they #can reach  more resulted by means of the cooperation that acting each country by separate.
They will have to be norms internationally guaranteed, among the *cuales has to appear the inviolability of the borders in front of the use of the strength, the guarantee of the security, but also of the autonomy of the minorities, no on the paper, but in the practice.
Already they find  in *Londres or in *Pristina, the minorities do not have to live with fear to lose the life or to suffer the consequences of a violence *azarosa directed to destroy his homes and his means of life.
We have to be able to use our vision and, then, the words that has pronounced in his intervention -»May #can be a month of hope»- #can be a message more *tranquilizador with regard to our future and, especially, to the future of peace and justice for the *Balcanes.
It has tried the Council of Ministers in this occasion put the means to elaborate a common strategic reflection and propose his elements, of course, to the Council of the Alliance, but that have felt for *Europa?
This use of the strength against the women, of the torture and the rape by nationalist reasons *atiza the spiral of the violence, the hate and the revenge with the that pretends  destroy any hope of a *Kosovo *multiétnico and in peace.
In these conditions, the Mr. #Spencer has elaborated a balanced report, a big reflection on this question in the that defends the cause of the peace, the cooperation and the maintenance of the dialogue among the distinct parts.
Like this as, I receive with satisfaction the report of the Mr. #Spencer put that, in place to establish the previous political conditions that accustoms to fix the European Parliament, presents some balanced approaches to the hour to examine this question.
Since I proceed of a city situated to banks of the *Danubio, also want *agradecerle the contribution that has taken today *cuando has highlighted the importance of this strip that crosses *Europa, that often has been stage of crisis and of wars, but that also #can be a strip of peace and cooperation, of links of the *Europa Western and Head office with the *Balcanes, but likewise with *Rusia, *Ucrania and in last term also with *Turquía, as *él has signalled.
It is precise to consider the northern dimension like a fundamental element, so much in the external relations of the Union, as in the taking of decisions for the inner development of the EU.
In last place, because it establishes in detail modalities of administration even of the costs of secretariat, so that it purchases the character of a thorough regulation and *fastidiosamente bureaucratic and invades like this the field of competition typical of the disposals that our Plenary #would have to elaborate through his own organs of *autogobierno.
Thus, the liberal Group, on the base of the proposals of the Mr. *Rothley, has formulated a proposal, adapted in determined looks to the proposal of the Council, and expect that tomorrow we obtain a favourable majority to *ella.
For the agriculture, #if the agreement *interinstitucional accepts , means that the new structure of the budget takes possible to distinguish clearly among, on the one hand, the traditional cost of market of support to the income that will be compulsory and, by #another, the new cost of rural development that will be a no compulsory cost.
The report that have received *yo now with a number #zero, not even with a statutory number, not even in my own language, *envie the report, the common position, to the Commission of Transports that do not gathers .
Lady Speaker, wish to begin for appreciating to the deputies of this Assembly his so kind comments and also say to the Mr. *Jarzembowski that will give  account that respect totally the rigour and the efficiency of his work even #if, in rare occasions, am not totally in accordance with his conclusions.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, in the #few minutes that hard my intervention perhaps was pertinent to give the thanks to the speaker and with *ella to the Mrs. Commissioner that also *nos accompanies in this last debate on the consumer of this Assembly and, in reality, *rendir homage to the process of *codecisión, that have applied and that perhaps was more representative more in this field that almost any #another process.
These resources are the free repairs, the replacement, the reduction of the price or the cancellation of the agreement in the case of objects defective.
Gentleman President, believe that nobody doubts to these heights of the need of a new program -in this occasion until the 2004- of community action in favour of the civil protection, although really there #be not #a lot of enthusiasm in the hemicycle by this program.
In the amendments that the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer has approved by a fine majority -an important majority- has deepened  in #some points of the proposal presented by the Commission that *nos seem important:
But have, to finalise, a question for the Mr. competent Commissioner, since the Directive 77/537 on the measures that have to adopt against the broadcasts of *contaminantes pertinent of the engines *diesel allocated to the propulsion of the agricultural or forest tractors follows valid.
But as it knows , situations of crisis #can also release strengths and deploy a special dynamics. The #german Presidency has confidence in taking justice to his responsibility in the development of the European Union for *convertirla in a community *paneuropea and to #the same time with capacity to act as a whole.
It is necessary to remember that, from the point of sight of the Parliament, #would have been preferable to leave #this in hands of the Commission and not following -as it said the Mr. *Santer- converting to the Commission in a species of Secretariat of the Council.
We need a new Treaty, today, and it more important is to give the signal of exit and indicate with accuracy the path to follow, mark the guidelines that have to come of Colony, especially because the public opinion, with the #sad experience of *Kosovo, shows that it is more sensitive that before to the paper that *Europa #can exert.
The external politics and of common security always has been *algo #as well as the stepson of the #european cooperation, among other reasons because #some of the States members greater have wanted to preserve the own primacy.
The *preponderancia of the practical Europeans regarding the labour market has to remain patent in the fact that a true dialogue among the organisations of the market of work *nos will allow to keep the growth and the creation of employment.
Today I #can not predict #if the Bosses of State and of Government go to contribute this strong political will, give the necessary step and open the new dimension of the integration that need urgently, but *les promise that we go to work with #all intensity in *ello.
With the conclusion of the Diary 2000 respected  the marked calendar in the European Council of *Cardiff and showed  the capacity of performance of the European Union under some difficult conditions.
The upper limit of the costs of the EU follow being of the 1, 27 % of the gross social product of the European Union and this upper limit neither goes to follow being employed totally.
Here, the Commission coincides fully with the European Parliament and am safe that the Parliament goes to follow being watchdog also in the future so that it have  sufficiently in account in the daily practice of the application of the reform of the structural Bottoms.
With the approval of the legislative proposals on the Diary 2000, have the privilege to plant an important foundation no only for the fulfillment of the hopes of our citizens and citizens but also for the *Europa of the future.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, after the votes on the Report *Rothley relative to the Statute of the deputies, only #can underline that the opinion issued by the Commission of compliance with the section 5 of the article 190 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, follows being in vigour.
Now well, his commitments do not have a lot that see with the hope and the expectation of the villages that, having chosen in the majority of our countries socialist governments or *socialdemócratas, have manifested his will of change.
It More worrisome of the intervention of the Mr. *Prodi have been his points of sight about the employment, the public sector and the regulation of the labour market.
The Mr. *Prodi considers that the public sector is too much wide and demands his rationalisation and a cut of costs, but, to #the same time, do not exposes more that *cándidos wishes to improve the situation of the employment.
The #portuguese socialists support a strong Commission, that was able of *movilizar the will of the Europeans, that respect to the citizens and the legitimate interests of the villages, in particular of the small countries like *Portugal.
Although *me #would result very difficult to accept the idea of a community fiscal system -is *algo that *yo #can not support- or #that of an increase of our wages, have to study the mood to share the costs of this Parliament.
The only reason so that we support parts of the draft again statute is that *nos seems a previous condition to finish with the waste that during #a lot of years has existed in the European Parliament to coast of the money of the taxpayers.
#This is so much graver in the measure that, *remunerados with charge to the #european budget and *abonándole a tax, the national deputies no longer #would have with his villages the bond of the finances neither of the taxation.
#Such as it is, the directive treats on this problem only through the hope, expressed in the considering 13, that the producers of sakes of consumption commercialised in varied States members include the directions of contact in said States; afterwards it is also the perspective of a future review of the directive, contemplated in the considering 20.
Under the #british Presidency, for example, reach to introduce a very expected agreement on the guarantees for the consumer by the that they establish  the rights of the consumer *cuando #this buys sakes of consumption in any point of the only market.
Thus, this decision is very positive, as it #would have supposed a step to backwards #if only we had made a labeling, as lamentably we have taken in the case of the novel *food , although the consumers have pronounced  against of foods manipulated genetically.
I want to express here my gratitude to the Commissioner, the Mrs. *Wulf-*Mathies, for having supported the position of the European Parliament in these questions, to the equal that in a series of other points.
Graver still, #this undermines the foundations of his culture, of his landscapes, of his gastronomy, and therefore of a big part of his identity. &#*x017*C;How, like this reformed, the *Europa agricultural, #such as *nos the present, will be able to defend his political project of agriculture and rural development in the future negotiations of the *OMC?
*Nos Had enjoyed to get more far in matter of association, but expect that the States members have the vision to guarantee a wide and more deep association in the preparation of programs and in the application of #the same.
Gentleman President, gentlemen Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen deputies, in the *primer report that, in name of the Commission of Fishing, presented to this Plenary on the regulation of the relative Council to the structural measures in the sector *pesquero, the Parliament supported three basic ideas.
As a result of his return to commission, now are in conditions to invite to the Assembly to approve the proposal of the Commission in the form in that it has been object of a political agreement in the Council.
*Contrariamente To my recommendations, the European Parliament did not vote a substantial revaluation of the premiums to the herds of cows *lactantes, that without embargo exert a positive paper in our territories.
The upper limit of 4.300 millions of euros to the year has to consider on the one hand like a *aseguramiento of the credits for the rural areas but, on the other hand, exists the danger that the States members, because of the demanded *cofinanciación of these measures, do not apply it or only of a mood reduced.
The speaker already took part in his day in the invention of the method of the financial perspectives with occasion of the budgetary crisis of 1987-1988, the that carried to the called «package *Delors *I», and also was speaker of the Parliament for the agreement of 1993.
Therefore, in front of the challenges that meant the implantation of the euro, the enlargement to the SIN, #as well as the necessary reforms of the *PAC and of the structural politics, the speaker recommended in his day that tried  sign a new agreement *interinstitucional, although it was in a context, #if it fits, of greater austerity that previously.
Regarding the transitory regulations on the that has talked  here or to the fact that they have to exclude , do not treats  of a maliciousness but that it is reflection that the regions have made progresses and that we have to *ocuparnos first of the poorest and not following helping to the rich that get slowly to reach the average.
To #the same time do not owe *escatimar efforts to reinforce the element of the prevention, to prevent, in the first place, that the persons lose his places of work; an argument very very defended by the speaker.
With regard to the external actions, exists the clear commitment of the Council to fund the additional needs that derive  of the situation in the *Balcanes, in necessary case, through a review of the financial forecasts.
I expect that the negotiations on the finance of the European Union for innovative projects of the *RTE in the current European Council confirm the importance of #Galileo for the #european producers and the #european users.
With the news of today of *COREPER that the Council is had to give his approval to the commitment reflected in the amendments that today have in front of *nosotros, #can confirm likewise the full support of the Commission to the position of the Parliament.
*Yo #Would want to finally appreciate to the Mrs. Commissioner the efficient work that has taken so that the new regional politics, the of the period 2000-2007, go tied to his name, in the sense that the #his has been an important contribution.
Subject: Development of the section 2 of the article 299 In front of the imminent entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, how measured prepares the Council for the development of the section 2 of the article 299 relative to the statute of the regions *ultraperiféricas?
Gentleman deputy, in his question has described of a very precise mood the problem that have and that have not been able to solve up to now; on the one hand, we want to protect to the producers of bananas that are especially linked to *nosotros but also have to respect the norms of the *OMC.
The Parliament has been an important voice to the hour to define the guidelines of this reform, but has to be it even more in his application during #all the period of programming.
Maybe it was #this my last intervention, because #if well I will go back to be available, my party do not goes excessively well, and therefore my last call to the Commission is the following: we Are especially attentive to #all #this; I expect that, in case of not going out reelected, *algún day #can read in the press that  *me have taken case.
And they are not positive looks like the maintenance of the community initiative *URBAN, by it other, against the opinion of *Berlín, the that they will be able to modify a position of deep doubt concerning the goodness and the efficiency of the future regulation of the structural Bottoms.
Gentleman President, after the taken care style of the Mr. *Martinez, *me fear that my posture goes to seem very spent, because *yo really believe that the agreement on the Diary 2000 reached in *Berlín, to weigh any complementary imperfection, remains registered in the active of the #german Presidency.
*Casandra Has  mistaken and have confirmed , so much the priority that has for the European Union the politics of cohesion social and economic, like the admirable and, especially, effective collaboration among the upper organs of the Community.
In the report on the northern dimension of the Union mentions  that, of compliance with it adopted by the European Council in *Viena, this dimension has to be also present in #all the decisions related with the inner development of the Union.
And for the group of *Europa, offer  guarantees to tackle the needs of zones gravely affected by the poverty and the abandonment, without forgetting the help to the great regions that suffer the industrial deterioration.
Concerning punctual details #can take  trials differentiated, but there #be *algo that it has to remain clear: that we have kept the calendar is an enormous benefit, so that this review of the structural bottoms in comparison with the of 1994 #can establish to time and go to avert go back to drop in the dilemma of five years ago.
Always *nos have declared in favour to impose the strict application of the criterion of a regional #GDP *per *capita minor of the 75 % of the community average for the election of the future Objective regions 1.
*Me Give account of it difficult that *les results to my colleagues of other States members comprise how much have dropped the wages of the agriculturalists of my country, *Irlanda, to cause mainly of the fact that this country depends enormously of his markets of export, so much in the EU as in third countries.
As any #another agreement in the frame of the disposals of dialogue social collected in the social chapter, #this illustrates also a new facet of the democratic deficit, #such as it already has explained the speaker.
Finally, the Commission entrusts in that the Parliament will consider timely to issue his *dictamen satisfied so that the Agreement #can go in in vigour, and appreciates once again the important backrest that has received in #all moment of this Parliament, no only for the strengthening of the relations with *México, but also for the establishment of a true alliance among *Europa and *América Latin that, little by little, goes  forging.
*Schengen Is, therefore, #one of our greater worries so much regarding the freedom of circulation of the citizens of the Union as to the freedom -that is indivisible- of the citizens of the third countries that live in regular situation in #any one of the countries of the Union.
The only area in the that the Commission of Environment, #whose opinion represent, and *yo same dissent of our friends and colleagues of the Commission of Subjects Juridical is in the subject of #if we have gone by the good path regarding protection of the consumers.
The directive do not treats -on the other hand, #can not take it- to question it that has achieved  through the rule on the rights of author and rights *afínes, approved takes little, neither pretends -wanted to *recalcarlo in concrete to the Mr. *Hoppenstedt-apply to it already regulated and harmonised with the Managerial «Television without borders», neither review definitions already consolidated in #the same.
I want to express my gratitude to #all #that that with his collaboration *me have offered a so fruitful experience, for me unforgettable, and expect that it continue  attributing to these subjects the decisive space that *les corresponds, with the determination and with the coherence that recognise  unanimously to our Parliament.
It treats  of *incentivar the citizen participation in the #european plane and to guarantee the rights of the persons to prevent that it #can prevail a negative evolution of these characteristics.
I believe that it is necessary to take in consideration the following element: the agreements *interinstitucionales modify -by means of the consent of the institutions- the distribution of the annual budgets and form part of a vision of the budget, vision that have accepted of common agreement.
It treated  of #one of the priorities of our Group of the Party of the European Socialists, #whose approval had reached in the Plenary of *Estrasburgo of 19 November 1998, and that we had to take accept by the Commission and the Council.
The Report *Aglietta, that claims for the European Parliament the right to interpose  in the measures of execution, specifically to *través of the *otorgamiento of a power of *revocación, *nos seems, as, that contradicts the philosophy of the current institutions of the Union.
It is particularly lucky can take it *cuando lives  a decisive moment of the process, with the signature of the agreement reached in the frame of the Nations Joined, in that it recognised  the possibility that the village *timorense decided freely his future.
By the wilful refusal of the #indonesian Government, the questions related with the security and the creation of a climate of peace and without *coacción on the population are not properly guaranteed.
Gentleman President, do not know #if #this is my last mandate. I do not know #if #this is my last speech, but in any case, are #where was, will remain at the side of #that that struggle by the right of self-determination of the villages and by the human rights, by the that *yo also will follow struggling, since *Timor Oriental finds  in #one of these situations.
Gentleman President, the Commission, of course, congratulates  by the historical progress that has made  in the final round of conversations *tripartitas celebrated under the auspices of the Nations Joined in New *York by the #portuguese and #indonesian Governments to resolve the ancient, delicate and dramatic problem of *Timor Oriental.
Very probably it had produced  a climbing of the conflict and the decision of the Palestinians perhaps #can increase the necessary mutual confidence for a durable peace.
The Europeans that have lived the *Segunda World-wide War and the period of *Hitler always will experience a deep feeling to the #jewish victims of the persecution, especially those who, as *yo, had #a lot of friends that lost the life in this catastrophe.
But in the bottom have taken the word to appreciate in name of my Group to two members of this Assembly that, in this sense, have delivered  in body and soul to the defence of the rights of the Palestinians.
Gentleman President, the European Commission thinks also that the #palestinian managers have taken a decision hit in interest of the #palestinian village when postponing the proclamation of the State announced for 4 May.
#If this year 2000 has a big symbolic value it is necessary to take advantage of it really to send this message of character universal: a moratorium for #all the cases in that it exists a sentence of conviction to death.
This *intergroup that occupies  of the International Penal Court says explicitly that the justice -the Mr. *Dell'#Alba is #one of the promoters of this *intergroup - has to protect in a juridical foundation. In the majority of the cases exists a juridical foundation to diverse levels, as *sucede at present in *Kosovo.
I believe that #this is the reason by the that #many of the conflicts that have produced  in the last ten or fifteen years have been *dirimidos with the arms and have not been resolved in the frame of a Court or a Penal Court.
The action of the transnational Radical Party «there #be not peace without justice» has contributed in part to take advance the that, in my opinion, is #one of the most important messages that #can direct at the end of a century that has been the more *sanguinario of the history.
It takes #some days reached  an agreement mark -graces also to the discreet but *importantísima work of the President #Michel *Rocard, to the one who congratulate- that it constituted and constitutes a fine base to reestablish the necessary conditions for the coexistence among the varied islands and the same existence of a State in the *Comoras.
On the other hand, the Commission is studying, with the States members, the possibility to initiate diplomatic management with seen to the application of the celebrated Agreement in *Madagascar on 29 April 1999 under the auspices of the *OUA.
I coincide with the speaker in that the result of the negotiations with the social speakers is so deficient that poses  the problem of the democratic deficit regarding the legislation based in the social dialogue.
The integrity of the persons has to constitute an increasingly important factor in the debate on the measures against the delinquency, for example, by means of a more rigorous inspection of the data.
With reason the Council and the Commission asked a decision to the European Parliament about the compensations and the quota of the starch of potato. It was simply a requirement so that it exist a fine administration.
Lady Speaker, always *me have felt proud that in the common agricultural politics achieved  join, reasonably, the interests of the first producing with the of the industry *manufacturera, but to #the same time giving a big balance to the interests of the consumer and of the taxpayer.
Of compliance with the Agenda, proceeds  to the discussion of the report (To4-0195/99) of the Mr. *Hoppenstedt in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education and Media, on the Communication of the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament «*Expo 2000 *Hannover» (*COM(99)0131 - *C4-0153/99).
It has to carry out a renewal that *le allow that these products or services are able to have, in the frame of a global economy, a sufficient acceptance as to reach a fine participation in the international markets.
Then, the Commission *recobró the enthusiasm, no against the States that refuse the introduction of clauses social and environmental in the rule of the international trade, but against the States members.
When treating  of the last planned session for the present term of office, propose to his *Señorías separate of the section 2 of the article 133 of the Regulation and approve, from this moment, the Record of the present session, that has gone  drafting to measure that developed  the debates.
The European Parliament has visited a long path from 1979 up to now, and in #Nicole *Fontaine have the suitable person to conduct to a good future the competitions, the faculties and the dignity of this Parliament.
*Nos Seems *importantísimo that now put  order in the Parliament so that a trip that costs 300 euros was not *reembolsado with 1.000 euros and of this form the wage go in by the main door and no hidden by means of benefits in species by the rear door.
The members of the EU no only kept his unit and his capacity of performance in this extraordinarily difficult stage, but that also showed a high constructive capacity.
The reason *estriba in that the war of *Kosovo went back to put of self-evident the goal of bottom of the #european integration, that is the construction of a durable peaceful order in our continent.
In *tercer place, with the end of the *cuarta and expect that last #yugoslav war in *Kosovo and the adoption of the Pact of Stability, the *Sureste European has now, for the first time in his history, a true opportunity to leave definitively backwards the nationalism and the violence and add to the *Europa of the integration.
Therefore, in the future will be *ineludible an enlargement of the rights of the European Parliament further of the new disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, but also a more adapted participation of the national Parliaments.
... But #if the Mr. *Poettering devotes  to proclaim that the Federal Chancellor German did not interview  with a commissioner designated before his nomination, *yo owe *recordarle that the previous Federal Chancellor *Kohl talked very often with the Mr. *Bangemann and already sees the results that obtained, or was, absolutely #any.
The decision to proceed to a military intervention to close the step to a racist politics, nationalist and of ethnic deportation in the *Europa of the century *XXI was received, as *ustedes know, with diversity of trials in the Group of the Greens.
The disarmament, the prevention of the crises and the civil resolution of the conflicts, particularly through an intensification of the paper of the *OSCE, run the risk to remain abandoned in the ditch.
*Me Seems -and treats  of #one *segunda education of these #european elections- that in numerous countries, in particular in Big *Bretaña and in *Francia, the voters have manifested a *euroescepticismo in increase and believe that, when voting by the parties of the opposition in the great #european countries, to *Europa, in the that take part the Governments, is to the that the citizens have wanted to sanction.
It #can that yes, from the point of sight of the statements of intentions, without embargo, *nos seems that all follow being very *nebuloso before being able to affirm in how dates the Union will convert  in a subject autonomous politician with his own external politics and of security.
Nevertheless, his intervention of today *me has affected a lot, as it has said #a lot of more things that the fact that it represents to the greater political Group of this Assembly and that has got to a coalition with the Liberal for the election of the President of #the same.
In definite, it that *les interests is not #who resolves his problems, but the fact that at last somebody occupy  of these problems, that the consumers #can *fiarse of the foods that buy, that the travellers take the plane with #all confidence, that the world of the sport was clean.
Now it treats  to concentrate #all our energies in the really important tasks: reconstruct the house of the one who has found  without home, *recomponer the communities destroyed and, it more important, have to offer to the *Balcanes a political and economic future clear that put end to *tantos centuries of continuous conflicts.
We have been so busy *reconstituyéndonos *nosotros same that still have not been able to take the duties and the owed investigation, so, #if the audiences take out to the light question of importance and of public interest that still *desconocemos, this Assembly will have the have to bear with *Europa to act, and will act -of course, my group will take it.
This Parliament has matured in the last months and have learnt a basic lesson for the coming years: no longer we are the partner of less category of the #european political institutions.
The systematic rejection by part of the Commission of positions of the European Parliament -even adopted by overwhelming majority- is not a fine attitude and the ancient Commission is the manager of *ello, wish to signal it.
#This is the vision, the challenge and for *nosotros -*nosotros the radicals- a criterion, a very clear approach, the federalistic approach of *Altiero *Spinelli that *nos will allow to know #if our Institutions leave or do not leave to the *reforzamiento of the Union, to more *Europa, to the *Europa political.
In the long run, I am convinced that, while it put  the car in front of the horse -with the Commission exerting a greater influence on the formulation of politics that the elect members of this Parliament-, the citizens of #all *Europa will follow showing apathetic to this institution.
We know the orientations that *usted treats to give to the Commission and that today has completed and required in it to the reform of the Institution refers , and *usted knows the orientation and the political worries of the European Parliament.
Without embargo, think that it is necessary to underline the suitability of *evidenciar the reasons by the *cuales recently has talked  also of a Pact by the Employment, #as well as the need to loan #a lot of attention to the regional disequilibriums that exist in *Europa.
The #finnish Presidency of the EU, together with the Commission, #would have to study how progresses are making  in this important subject in #all the European Union so that the worries of the consumers on the new coin are fully attended.
We agree with #this, had as we are to take part in the process of solidarity among the States through an External Politics and of Common Security by the that my Group struggles from the principle of his presence in the European Parliament.
By this reason, on 29 June the Commission has demanded to the competent #turkish instances that take into account this rejection of the pity of death by part of the European Union.
Regarding the institutional subjects, the #finnish Presidency has an enormous responsibility: the to set up the works that will carry to the conclusion of a statute on the fundamental rights.
Gentleman President, lady minister, coincide with *usted in that the sentence to death of the leader *kurdo Mr. *Öcalan puts to the international community in front of an important challenge, since it violates the minimum requirements of the justice #as well as of the respect to the human rights.
By this reason, in spite of the rape of the human rights and of the ethnic cleansing against the *kurdos by the diet of *Turquía, our Group do not requests that the European Union neither the NATO bomb *Turquía.
And to *ello it is necessary to add the requirement, by part of the European Union, that the #turkish Government have a conversation with the *kurdos, by means of a dialogue that achieve a solution for the claims *kurdas of autonomy inside *Turquía, #as well as the respect of his democratic rights.
The gentleman Commissioner *Bangemann manifested in his letter dated on 29 June and directed to the then President #Gerhard *Schröder his intention to go in to the service of a private company of communications, to know, the #Telephone #spanish company.
This crisis has influenced negatively in our exports, and #some measures taken by commercial partners of the Union have *desbordado the real proportions of the crisis in #a lot of looks, so much by the gravity of said measures as by his practical applications.
Alas, the Commission was not informed on the problem by the #belgian authorities until 27 May. Immediately, we set up #all a series of measures with the end to protect the health so much of persons as of animals.
We have to establish a juridical base to use a clause of protection in case of dangers that arise in the European Union related with edible products for animals and that they #can represent a serious risk for the health of persons or animal #as well as for the environment.
To *ello added  the fact that the decision of the Community on the withdrawal of the markets of products potentially contaminated was executed by part of the #belgian authorities of an entirely insufficient mood.
These failures have caused a dramatic situation, in the first place, of course, for the public health and second have meant an economic disaster for the agriculture and for #all the alimentary sector.
Our Parliament has to to the #european citizens *algo more that the simple complaint of a criminal act, as in the case of *Bélgica, that, on purpose, Mr. Commissioner, has not taken publics still the names of the companies that used foods for animals contaminated by the dioxin.
Accepting contrary rules to our interests and disposals #such as the sufficiency of the scientific proof, that *nos forbid in practical apply the principle of caution, the previous Commissions have caused *estragos considerable to our society and to our economies.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *Europa knows, already from takes #some years, a succession of scandals alimentary: had the «crazy cows»; *nos interrogate on the *OGM and his labeling; at present we experience the problem of the animal flours that contain dioxin; we see that they withdraw  of the sale drunk very common because they cause problems...
Of here that the Commission have to draft and formulate proposals to take a positive list of matters prevail authorised for the animal feeding, accompanied of a study on the incidence in the costs of production of the feeding grazier to avert incompatibilities with the *PAC.
I have received six amendments and, once again, as I finish to say it, only reflect the distribution among political Groups, is to say the exchange of charges in the interior of a same group or well add a nomination in a place that found  vacant.
The European Parliament, #as well as numerous associations of consumers, has had the opportunity to give elements of answer that are #others *tantos indexes posed to carry out a reflection in favour of a new definition of the alimentary approach of the European Union.
It treats  you give priority to the interest of the consumers, to take that it prevail the principle of caution on any #another principle and establish a control integrated of the whole of the alimentary chain, of the producer to the consumer.
Lady Speaker, in this Assembly has converted  in a species of tradition that the deputies put  in foot to say that his name do not appears in the list of assistance of the previous day.
The Commission considered that these factors -the application without precedents of the law, the relative conventions to previous sales of entrances for international tournaments and the constructive action of the *CFO- justified the *imposición of a symbolic sanction, more that of a punishment.
It wanted to signal that the coasts for each deputy that took part in said legal action were of the order, oh surprise, of the 1.000 pounds, a quite greater sum that the fine imposed to the organisers of the Glass of the World.
It is a universal feeling in the Commission, reason by the that my colleague the Mr. Go *Miert and his collaborators of the Commission tried specifically take *algo effective bear, once and for all, avert in the future and also in 1998 the application of practices discriminatory by part of the *CFO.
*Cuando Listened #some of the interventions made in the course of this debate, #can not avert the feeling of that, sometimes, the first victim of the football is the truth, because there #be had #one or two interventions loaded of passion, but that in general did not recognise the facts.
*Les Remember that in his meeting of the Thursday 9 September, the Conference of Presidents had decided to subject the question to the Commission of Control Budgetary, so that it elaborated a report.
. Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the Commission received the past Friday the text of the second inform of the Committee of Experts Independent, that analyses the administrative management of the Commission and formulates proposed of face to his reform.
In my modest opinion, like Commissioner with a long experience, have curiosity to know #which goes to be, in this precise moment, in the moment of the truth, the behaviour of #all *nosotros in front of a new model of organisation of the #european integration.
The dissemination of information on the scope of threats of marine pollution - hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that they take  the best measures of *mitigación possible and enjoy of the complete support and confidence of the public.
Gentleman President, appreciate to the Commission of Environment, and in particular to his speaker, the Mrs. *McKenna, #as well as to the members of the Commission of Budgets, the work made and the interest that have devoted to this proposal.
Besides, the valid international agreements on protection of the Mediterranean Sea, of the Sea *Báltico and of the Sea of the North, in the that the Community is part *contratante, follow #all *ellos #the same approach of not mentioning any substance in concrete;
*Nosotros sustain, in the matter, the request of the Mrs. #Jackson of not to content with approving recommendations, but to happen to the stage of a true managerial, that fix some precise criteria that #all the States members will have to respect in his inspections.
*Cuando Get the moment, my Group has intention to contribute, in the breast of the Assembly and in the suitable forums, to a debate that expect that it initiate  on the lessons that like Parliament have to learn of the process of auditions.
In the auditions, the commissioners have shown  so conciliatory in front of the majority of deputies that even those groups that by reasons *extraeuropeas had promised to show aggressive have buried the axe of war with #all rapidity.
The next *CIG is the greater challenge to the that confronts  the European Union like political and economic organism from the decisions taken during the negotiations of the Treaty of *Maastricht that set up the process of the Economic and Monetary Union.
*Le Ask that it was very ambitious in this direction and that reach that the relation among the Commission and the Parliament, as *usted had occasion to manifest in a meeting with the parliamentary spokesmen, do not add zero, but that it was a positive sum.
No *cuando overlook  #all the warnings and proposes  to commissioners on the that the *primer report of the committee of wise persons has launched serious doubts; without embargo, after the conversation, in the commission did not take  any critical question to the Mr. *Lamy during his oral appearance.
It has talked  of the political balance of the Commission, that is not a condition inscribed in the Treaties, but a requirement that demands the political prudence and also the consideration to this House.
*Cuando The commissioners do not have #all the responsibility and #all the authority on #all the administration, #all the references to a responsible administration sound to hollow, and am safe that the Mr. *Kinnock, to the equal that the majority of *nosotros, accustoms to carry  better out of house.
Without embargo, is #likely that with frequency seat  alone in the table of debates of the Commission, as *usted, gentleman *Prodi, do not has the lower idea on the interests of the persons that live in the European Union, although it always talks of the #european soul and the has to flower of lips.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen deputies, no *les will surprise that the #belgian delegation of the *PPE #can not give his approval *unísona to this school of commissioners, but for the next years will keep a constructive position to work with #all the school of commissioners.
The Mr. *Fischler expressed *verbalmente the political commitment to keep the current General Direction of Fishing, modifying the statement that had taken by writing in his questionnaire and accepting, therefore, keep the current General Direction of Fishing.
Therefore *le ask to *usted that take very fine note of *ello; and also I ask it  to the Mr. *Kinnock, that is to his left, like Vice-president commissioned of the reform, since it is a condition *sine *qua *non for the maintenance of the parliamentary confidence that have awarded to the Mr. *Fischler in our commission.
The majority of the commission also declared  satisfied with the answers of the Mrs. Palace to the indictment of the socialists in relation with the investigation of the subventions to the crop of the linen in *España.
That the Commission take his reflection -*nosotros the go to take also-, and afterwards go to try -the two institutions of the European Union- get to a preparatory document to facilitate the adoption of agreements.
In summary, gentleman *Prodi, still #can *convencerme with an active measure, but #this will have to constitute a signal very *convincente for the Parliament and the public opinion or of it contrary *yo go to vote against tomorrow, to the equal that #many #others, and my negative vote will not be a "no" to *Europa, but a vote in favour of #one *Europa clean, democratic and transparent.
*Ello Gave a quite unreal character to his exercise since it #can not, and with reason, integrate the drama of *Kosovo and his financial consequences, and finally because, by reasons that no *nos seem very satisfactory, #this denied  to answer to the worries expressed by the Parliament in matter of administrative reform.
It is not especially careful that the Commission of Budgets and the Council of the Presidency talk on the foundation of an alone place- *C, while the European Parliament has 1776 places of this type.
In the first place, as I already said in my own intervention, my opinion is that the problem on the coverage of the financial needs of *Kosovo goes to be with #all certainty #one of the essential questions of the Autumn.
*Yo Said that we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission in spite of the reservations that keep in relation with the Mrs. of Palace, #whose innocence boast but #whose conception of the political responsibility in a subject that concerns to the community budget do not share.
I want to express my satisfaction regarding the urgency of the fulfillment of the article 13 of the Letter of rights fundamental, urgency that the Minister *Halonen underlined in his intervention and that *yo share, so *yo also expect that the Commission take initiatives to the *respecto.
The protection of the privacy is regulated in the Statement of the Human Rights, in the International Treaty on political rights and citizens, #as well as in the European Treaty on the rights of the man.
By a part, treats  of security and of fundamental rights, is to say, of inalienable individual rights. On the other hand, it treats  of the protection of this security and of the protection of these individual rights by part of the public organisms, and more in particular, by part of the public organisms that they have to create in *Europa.
But *presentimos, after the speech that have heard here this morning, that #can be it, since it that in the Treaty of *Amsterdam was by strength allocated to be "dead letter" or mere music celestial, earns some public relief, favourable greater consensora, imposes  of course by the need, by it that goes back credible a common space of freedom, security and justice.
Besides, because it gives  preference to the community method concerning the cooperation *intergubernamental traditional, it that *propiciará a new juridical identity or institutional #european, more effective, modern and next to the problems that until today go  rotting, without resolving, by the *empecinamiento in the *soberanismo and in the nationalist juridical-fetishism.
This sentence has at least the merit to show that the European Parliament and the Commission go to support  mutually to increase his respective powers and *pisotear the decisions of the Council.
#If it that pretended was to take *borrón and new account, is clear that our attempt has failed because with these two gentlemen is impossible to go back to begin from zero. And we do not forget that the #european citizens have right to that *nosotros, deputies to the European Parliament, control that the members of the Commission are #all persons *intachables.
To the contrary of the #european right, that has tried manifestly disguise his divisions by means of the virulence of his attacks, sometimes personal and *injuriosos, against some Commissioners, *yo *me propose to give preference to the road of the *concertación and the collaboration with the future Commission.
That the #european citizens recover the illusion and the confidence in the process of construction #european depends now of the Commission that, under the direction of the President *Prodi, begins today his career.
By this reason, in the debate of morning it #would be necessary to decide that the Office of Reconstruction install  in *Pristina, and that of any way was attached to the Office of Control of the Treaty of Stabilisation in *Tesalónica.
(Green/*ALE) -. (*FI) Gentleman President, want to appreciate to the Council of Ministers his firm performance in the organisation of the referendum for the independence of *Timor Oriental, among other things, sending a Delegation of high level, of the that formed part #some of our colleagues in representation of the European Parliament.
During long the international community has allowed that they survived the called dictatorships of the development, of Indonesian to the *Chile of the *Chicago *Boys, happening by Chinese and *Corea, these countries in that, in name of the macroeconomy, have tolerated that the reasons of market prevailed on the reasons of the human rights.
The supply of this information will facilitate a lot the contribution of the Parliament to the development of an external politics of the European Union more effective and more coherent, a politics that #would have to have from takes already long.
Alas I have not been never in *Timor oriental but *me seat very next of the village of *Timor, that comes suffering since Indonesian carried out the annexation in 1975 and that has lost almost the third part of the population, murdered by the #indonesian, a proportion of deaths still greater that in the #ex *Yugoslavia.
*Cuando Was appointed Secretary of External Subjects, the Mr. *Cook proposed an ethical external politics that, among other things, contained the obligation to impose a rigorous code of behaviour in matter of controls for the exports of armaments.
The Council backs the celebration of an extraordinary meeting of the Commission of Rights Human and the nomination of a delegation of investigation that was sent to the zone.
The nuclear head office that goes  to build in *Marruecos is related with the desalinisation of the water and *desconozco #if *Marruecos has #the same problem that *nosotros pose in our presumptive on the head office that goes  to install in *Turquía, is to say, the problem of the seismicity, and precisely after the terrible earthquake of takes #few days in *Turquía.
It #can indicate the Council #which are the States members of the Union #whose citizens do not require visa to travel to the #EE.UU. And how management thinks to make in front of said country with the end that the suppression of the compulsory visa affect to #all the citizens of the European Union?
Gentleman President, as it mentions the Mr. Deputy, #some of the countries candidates to the EU have requested in the negotiations of adhesion transitory periods to follow limiting the free acquisition of real estates by part of the citizens and companies of the European Union.
Gentleman President, agree with the Mr. Deputy in that it #would be convenient to include the minimum labour norms in the list of subjects of the next " Round of the #Millenium" of the *OMC, and already in the *preparativos has split  of the base that it is necessary to take out to debate these subjects.
It wanted to know #if the Council is had to study #some measures of this type with seen to demolish this literally criminal diet, it that *nos #would avert, as in the case of the Soviet Union, cry 30 or 40 years after the tragedy.
The Commission takes a call to #all the parts so that they respect the Resolution 1244 of the Council of Security, #as well as the agreements and the military initiatives in his whole, and wait that the deployment of the *KFOR and the *UNMIK complete  fully without great delays.
Then it is necessary to pose also another problem: #Which have been the damages *ocasionados by the actions and the events of *Kosovo in other States that, inside the context of the Union *Europa, lived the vicinity in his own meat?
I insist, nevertheless, in that the Commission and the Parliament share #the same goal: improve to the maximum the rapidity and the efficiency of the efforts of the Commission on the terrain in *Kosovo for the population of the region.
I expect that the European Commission take the initiative, with the narrow cooperation of the Parliament, to convert  in a more active speaker in Orient Half and do not keep  to the *margen and allow that they are the Americans the that take the initiative.
The report has been elaborated by the Mrs. *Morgantini, on the signature by the Commission of an agreement with the Organism of dramas public and aid of Nations Joined for the refugees of Palestinian.
This disposal has governed previous contributions of the European Union in the frame of successive agreements and has deserved reiterated praises of the Organism of Nations Joined, because it averts the erosion of the value of the community contribution.
The Assembly will be conscious that, in the context of the process of peace in Orient Half and of the agreements of peace of *Oslo, the subject of the refugees left  for the conversations on the definite situation.
The budgetary plans presented to the European Parliament for his consideration included initially the recommendation to reduce the bottoms allocated to the campaigns of security *vial in *Europa in 1,5 millions of pounds (1,9 millions of euros).
Gentleman President, the resolution that finishes to approve  on the politics of cooperation police, judicial and circulation of persons for the preparation of the next European Council of *Tampere reveals #some changes, apparently favourable, in the position of the Parliament.
Said #this, the community Institutions have to, in my opinion, ask to the competent #russian authorities explanations of the employment of the bottoms allocated to the development of the country and for his alimentary needs.
This cathartic effect *nos #would allow definitely to the European Union formulate a new approach of our relations with *Turquía and develop a more positive collaboration in a spirit of authentic solidarity, and #Grecia has to show to himself/hisself same that is had to take part in this project.
Like this as, we believe that it has to take an immediate intervention, have of the resources demanded by the second and *tercer *MCA and can create the concrete mechanism, #such as the other speakers have requested also, for the *blindaje *antisísmico and the forecast of the pertinent damages of the earthquakes.
The Council of Subjects General of this week has engaged  to approve and apply what before the regulations and asks to the European Parliament - and talk by mouth of the Council - that #take in his considerations.
They #can not  justify of any way, but, *Señorías, do not situate this type of revenges to #the same height that the ethnic cleansings and the systematic terror that have existed in the last ten years.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the fears manifested takes an instant by our colleague, the Mr. *Zimeray, are justified by the recent conviction to death of four persons, after some student demonstrations that took place in July; the *ahorcamiento, the past year, of a man of 60 years the confirms.
I consider unforgivable, that are subsidising a #millionaire program of roofs with solar energy and do not have invest at all in renewable energies, so much in *Bruselas as in *Estrasburgo, neither practise here any type of saving energetic: for example, the halls of our dispatches find  lit day and night and is not possible *apagarlos, and similar cases.
To this *respecto wanted to say that, when seeming, only by my intervention has been possible that, for example, today was opened this café, that some services are working Wanted to ask that during the week of session this building #can be used in #all his capacity of #Monday to Friday.
*Me Seem excellent these initiatives to solve the small problems but, to my trial -and is the of #a lot of colleagues-, do not forget that they are small problems that will solve  and are in front of *algo by it that it is necessary to congratulate to the institutions, to the #french State, to the architects and to the workers.
It is not acceptable that elaborate to #all haste a report during the holidays of summer to answer to the query of the Council and that afterwards #this not even give  by *enterado of the amendments that propose and much less consider the possibility of *hacerlas #his.
*Nosotros Wanted to that from the moment in that it believes  the Agency remain absolutely clear that his administration will be rigorous, that the Agency of Reconstruction with headquarters in *Salónica will be closely linked to the Pact of Stability, #whose general barracks will establish  also in *Salónica, and that the agency of *Kosovo will establish  there like operative component of #that.
And the 80% of the means allocated to the agriculture delivers  among the 20% of the agricultural companies. *Ello Means clearly that takes years that the agricultural politics European has put  of part of the alimentary industry in place to bet by the small agriculturalist and the quality.
In this context, without embargo, #can not ask to the producers that sacrifice  by a problematic that with frequency *les sees *rendidos and won, defeated in front of the market by extraneous faults and having in front the perspective of terms very long to go back to win a confidence conquered to base of efforts and with costs of production very often *subestimados or at least no valued fully.
It wanted to without embargo demand the attention of the Assembly and of the Commission on a look with frequency forgotten of #all this problematic as it is the resignation of the #european managers, of the health and security of the especially national consumers.
To the sight of #all #this, estimate that in benefit of the citizens and of the consumers have to exist clear directives, because the levels of exhibition of the human being to the dioxin and the *BPC -that belong to #the same category of the dioxins- are the lowest possible.
In general lines requires  it following: in the first place, in the legislative field, it is necessary to examine the community legislation referred to the foods, to the *piensos, to the matters prevail, to the additives, to the preservatives, to the substances *contaminantes, like the *biocidas, to the labeling.
Like this the things, do not comprise how the European Commission has been able to *recortar the initial budget of the programs of help to the fight against the AIDS, especially in it that to the third countries refers .
*Me Refer, as it is obvious, to the Agreement of *Lomé, to this agreement of association *algo exclusive and *algo special that always have announced that it was the answer of the European Union to the ancient colonies, #as well as to other realities, but that, in definite, directs  to the #african continent.
To5-0018/1999 of the Mr. *H.-*P. #Martin, in name of the Commission of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the proposal of decision of the Council ((*COM(99)0404 - *C5-0099/1999 - 1999/0166(*CNS)) relative to the attribution of helps *macrofinanciera to the ancient Yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia;
Which means that we need a change of orientation structural and that the political recover the primacy in this field and assume the responsibility to promote an economic development and socially balanced truly stable.
Without embargo, do not believe that it correspond to the Commission define internally in the national budgets how goes  to establish the global budget since, as it said previously, these bottoms of the that are talking do not have in himself/hisself same a concrete destination of #one or another nature.
Regarding the report *Langen on the that take part more in concrete and the sources of energy renewable, #everyone knows the importance of these energies in the reduction of the pollution and in the preservation of the natural resources.
Like conclusion, will say that the vote of these two reports constitutes a guarantee for the #european citizens of the will of the European Union to protect the environment reducing our energetic dependency.
#One of the that know is the conversion of the thermal energy of the ocean, that uses the difference of temperature among the cold waters of the depths of the tropics and the warm superficial waters.
But in the terrain of the energetic saving the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental #can obtain better resulted that the States members of the European Union, in spite of making #the same efforts. In this look his performance is #a lot of greater.
Keep some special relations with *Sudáfrica is a way to support his economic development, at the same time that strengthen the potential of the country to give a positive impulse to #all the region
To boost all #this, the European Parliament has to take advantage of #all the possibilities that  *le offer in the frame of the political dialogue structured agreed and offer to *Sudáfrica the maximum possible support in his efforts to reach the stability.
Gentleman President, before that at all it wanted to give the thanks to the speaker by his excellent report, that begins with the following sentence: "After five years of debate, doubts, evasive, queries and negotiations, has got the moment to apply an Agreement of Trade among the European Union and *Sudáfrica".
It confirms a clear determination by part of the EU to support the process of change and reform in *Sudáfrica and reflects the wish by part of both parts to expand his political contacts, commercial and of cooperation in benefit of *Sudáfrica and, in fact, of #all the region of the *África meridional in group.
#This have been the subjects that today have debated , amen of, as in #all meeting of the Commission, an infinity of looks relative to the procedure that, without embargo, do not suits to mention in front of the Parliament.
#All the political and administrative realities of this world, always has found a new strength in his administration; here, by the contrary, the administration has grown by stratifications and not watching to the future.
With #everything, in my opinion, have three levels: the President, the specific Commissioners on the subjects and the routine that has to treat in the more fast and transparent form possible -by Internet or through communications by writing- because it do not deserves a debate.
My answer is yes, of general form, without linking  to #such or *cual marries, #can fund with the credits of the Structural Bottoms studies of prevention of the seismic risk so much in #Grecia as in other countries, with the condition that the #greek Government *nos ask it.
Said foundation will pipe these bottoms through a hundred of organisations no governmental to fund activities in the fields of the human rights, the protection of the environment, the social assistance, etc., #among others.
- (GIVE) I Assisted with big interest to the debate of this morning on the security of the foods and have thus a question for the Mr. Commissioner: it is the principle of caution the that now it has to subject to proof in the Commission as a result of the war of the hormones with the #EE.UU.?
The Official Diary of the European Communities (*DO), that precisely spreads the community legislation, have a thrown of 20.000 copies for a population of 380 millions of persons. It is not of *extrañar that the access to the information was difficult.
Simultaneously to the possible adhesion of the Union to the anti-doping world-wide agency, are convinced that we need a #european plan, a plan that involve our responsibility, with the Fifteen walking to #the same rhythm to combat the *lacra of the doping.
After my long years of experience like euro-deputy, *yo neither conceive the informative politics exclusively in the field of the "high spheres" , but that believe that it also has to be directed to the youngest, to the boys, that absorb like sponges the information that afterwards will use along #all his life.
Like the Commissioner, expect that this decision contribute to the development of an economic and social sector fundamental for the #european populations that live of the fishing and, in general, for the feeding of the #european citizens.
I expect sincerely that the confidence arisen among these two countries like consequence of the distention *les give the possibility to attack with #the same spirit that the shown in the last debates the difficult relative questions to the security of the region.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the #french deputies, #flemish and Italians of the coordination of rights #european are favourable to the establishment with *Turquía of relations based in the reciprocal respect, the reciprocal advantages, the no interference in the inner subjects.
The first, that the relations among the European Union and *Turquía are fundamental for both parts in the present and in the future, in #all the fields and to #all the levels and, second, that has to be priority for the European Union boost of intelligent way the democratisation of *Turquía.
#If *Turquía accepts, together with the prerogatives, also the obligations that link, without exception, to #all the members that wish to annex to the European Union, and #if it fulfils consistently the criteria and the calendars that derive of the common decisions of *Copenhague and of *Luxemburgo, then will be able to reach his #european goals.
The inclusion of *Turquía in the European Union #would be an excessive charge for the European Union and #would impose to *Turquía a political change radical that #can not fulfil in a predictable term and that, as I know, neither wants to make.
Gentleman President, the passionate and exciting character of the debates celebrated the past week in *Bruselas in the breast of our Group, #as well as the that they are celebrating  in this hemicycle, show, #if it was necessary, the importance of the question that today  *nos subjects.
It is truth that this point of sight is of big importance, but the economic and regional collaboration, that has to be considered in the group of #all the parts involved, is a paramount factor to increase the confidence and ensure the peace achieved.
The #finnish Presidency understands that there #be possibility to achieve deep changes in the zone and will follow working with our partners by the peace and by the common interest through #all the means to our scope.
The deputies will remember, as it has said the Presidency, that the European Union is the greater financial donor of the world-wide help to carry the reconciliation to the population of Orient Next.
In view of our important contribution to the help to the Palestinians that surpasses the 50% of the total, the greater part of the future meetings of coordination of donors #would have to celebrate, in our opinion, inside the Union and be *copresididas by the Been member of the European Union that exert of host of the meeting.
Gentleman President, this proposal celebrates the fine news, the hit of the negotiations of *Sharm The *Sheik and the agreement on the runner of security for the products, the vehicles and the #palestinian population.
In this context, receive with satisfaction the decision of the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the cancellation of the disposals of the Palestinian National Letter, that asks the destruction of #Israel.
In addition to the relative questions to the sovereignty and the security among #Israel and the *Líbano, the return of the refugees will be of special interest for the *Líbano, country in the that the ethnic balance sees  affected by the presence of 250.000 #palestinian refugees in his territory.
Gentleman President, in the Basque Country have examined with interest #all the process of peace #palestinian, because in *Euskal *Herria also support the need to surpass the current political conflict through democratic agreements.
We have said to the eleven countries candidates that the status of candidate to the adhesion is to #the same time a promise of adhesion and #if #this is like this devaluates  said status when conceding  it to *Turquía but saying to #the same time that do not goes  to negotiate.
To reach the goals of the Union is very important to convince to the countries in roads of development of the advantages of a wide round and of the fine intentions that there #be behind this posture of the EU.
For the #european opinion also is necessary to strengthen the capacity of creation artistic in the audiovisual field, key sector of our culture, and the Union has to answer to this expectation.
Have the will -taking out split of our dimension, of our weight in the world-wide economy and of the institutional progresses that have made- of *reconquistar a sovereignty that the world-wide markets sometimes *nos contest and to contribute to #one *gobernabilidad global effective?
We defend the #european model of agriculture that covers by the same the production of foods, the conservation of the familiar agricultural exploitations, of the rural areas and the protection of the environment.
As only a European Union with capacity to negotiate, will be able to reach that it get  in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade in the process of the globalisation to a better balance among the #european model and the North American *liberalizador.
First, the Commission already has declared that it do not has any objection to that in the conclusions that will approve  in *Seattle include  the text on the paper of the European Parliament in the organisation and realisation of the new round of the *OMC.
We wanted to believe it, but *nos prevents it the bitter experience purchased, for example, with the ancestor of the Mr. *Lamy, *Sir *Leon *Brittan, #whose commitments in this Parliament of *oponerse to the American compacter resulted punctually broken: see the case of the law *Helms-*Burton and of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
Gentleman President, is not more that a X-ray of the moment. In base to this X-ray, believe that it proceeds to take an only call, and is the following: How it thinks the European Commission keep joined to #all these loving hedgehogs, afterwards, a time that feel  around the table in *Seattle?
They pretend to expand the liberalisation every time to more sectors and to more countries, included the agriculture and the essential services for the development and the improvement of the quality of the life of the populations, like the education and the health.
I am convinced that this Parliament do not goes to ratify a Treaty in the that they do not have a position elevated the principle of prevention, the protection of the consumer and the sanitary politics.
Resort to the taxes like threat without *combinarlos with subventions to adapt the most ancient head offices so that they adjust  to the requirements of broadcasts acceptable and generally without increasing the investment in the surveillance of the broadcasts no *surtirá effect.
In name of the #finnish Presidency #can say that we consider important that the Union take progresses in the establishment of a common tax to the energy, even have proposed the possibility that the countries that want to, #can advance more quickly in this direction.
#Which will be the criteria of cast territorial of the relative structural Bottoms to the #spanish State and allocated legally to the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *n1 1 in the period 2000-2006?
But my question to the Council is the following: it thinks the Council *presionar to the States members with taxes of execution of the inferior structural Bottoms to the #european average so that they execute better the bottoms and prevent that it reproduce  the effect "ball of snow" ?
How it thinks to take the Council to promote the approval of a *quinto plan of action, with sufficient means and a precise calendar, and how measured goes to take to fix concrete goals and *mensurables in the field of the equality of opportunities among men and women?
Subject: only Method in the statistics of *toxicomanía The European Observatory of the Drugs and the *Toxicomanías with headquarters in *Lisboa commissions  to analyse the statistics on *toxicomanía pertinent of the States members. *Ello Allows to study the development of the *toxicomanía to scale #european and compare the national statistics.
Like this as, it is urgent that the #european citizens #can understand that the increase of the resources assigned to the fight against the drugs corresponds, literally, to an increase of the consumption of drugs and, therefore, that the politics applied are a complete failure.
How measured goes to take the Presidency to combat this form of purification cultural and to consolidate the paper of the libraries in plough of the democracy and the information?
Subject: peripheral insular Regions During the #finnish Presidency, goes to define the Council his politics around the peripheral insular regions of the Goals 1 and 2, in relation with the politics of infrastructure, agriculture and employment?
Taking into account the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, thinks the Council now take all it possible to reach the adoption of a global community program of fight against the poverty and #can indicate in how measured thinks to support actions of the EU in matter of accommodation and in favour of the persons without home?
Subject: Access of the public to the meetings of the Council #One of the goals of the #finnish Presidency is that the majority of the meetings of the Council are public and accessible so much to the citizens as to the media.
Have, therefore, a big responsibility to impose our political weight and the commercial agreement and of cooperation to detain this war and procure that the dialogue restart  with the President *checheno and with the Parliament *Checheno chosen under the supervision of the *OSCE.
*B5-0169/1999 of the Gentlemen *Frassoni and *Wuori, in name of the Green Group/*ALE, on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of the capital penalties by the General Assembly of the Nations Joined;
Gentleman President, *me ask #if the Commission #can give his support to the proposal that presented so that the EU summon a meeting with the representatives of the *OSCE with the object to argue the situation of the #gipsy with #all #that that act in the zone.
The greater part of the problems with that *nos confront will fit in any place of the frame established for the organisation of the support and the restoration of the society in *Kosovo, or was that *me seems that it suffices with the current organisation, but anyway *les will transmit his wish.
Without embargo, the Commission knows very well that the conjoint utilisation of the aerial space by diverse users, civil and military, #can be the cause of problems of security, as it already is responsible in part of the congestion and the delays of the aerial traffic.
#That is, of course, our position, but has been the accident of the another day the rale of death of the nuclear industry, or have to follow suffering the nuclear terror before we achieve to put final point to this monstrous industry?
Gentleman President, *cuando in the last years have talked of the employment of the atomic energy for the generation of energy electrical always *nos have referred to the dangerous reactors of the East, that are of #russian manufacture.
Regarding the utilisation of fuel *MOX in head offices *nucleoeléctricas, the pertinent decision the adopts the company of services public that it treat , after having received the timely licence of the national authorities of security.
#If we want to conserve the general advantages, social, human and environmental of a clean atmosphere, then the norms fixed by the recent managerial of the European Union on the broadcasts of the vehicles and the quality of the fuel have to respect rigorously.
*Señorías, the report and the proposal of decision that present and that go to explain in brief in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional refers  to the application of the Agreement *interinstitucional on the modalities of the investigations *antifraude.
#All know that this regulation gets in a very timely and important moment, a moment of demand generalised of fight against the fraud, and against the circumstances that take it possible, with the last goal of his total eradication.
The proposal of the Mr. *Napolitano, proposal that, as *él same has said, was approved without objection #any by the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, constitutes a clear step, a very concrete step in this direction.
A decisive question for the confidence of the participants in the reliability of the juridical businesses celebrated by electronic road is the question of the juridical efficiency of #such procedures.
In the field of the juridical harmonisation is precise to find always a difficult balance among the necessary harmonisation, by a part, and the respect to the existent juridical traditions in the States members, by #another.
In his first reading, the Parliament encouraged  a lot for adding an important additional goal, that consisted in tackling the problem of the *derramamiento of diesel in the roads, that comes posing an every time greater risk for the users of #the same, and very particularly for the *motociclistas.
Therefore, *yo expect that, on the base of the agreements that adopt the Parliament this week, the Council and the Commission consider the possibility to establish definitively the procedure of the consultative committee.
In the past #this was a rather ambiguous sphere, but is to expect that now, with the introduction of these four amendments, have cleared the situation by it that refers  to #all the persons that use this type of facilities.
Gentleman President, *señorías, wanted to *sumarme to it said by the two orators that *me have preceded in the use of the word to express my gratitude and also my approval by the work effected by the general speaker and by the Commission of Budgets.
*Tercer Objective: a reinforcement of the means in matter of fight against the delinquency and, chamber, a budgetary line that allow to adopt measures in the frame of the plan of action of the Commission 2000-2004 of fight against the traffic of drugs.
We #would not have to run the risk to restrict the juridical protection in the European Union, especially *cuando continuously proclaims  the will to create a space of freedom, security and justice.
The fault of imagination that has manifested up to now the Council has to give step to a more realistic consideration, also regarding the future competitions of the Parliament, included the competitions in the budgetary field.
Culture has not gone out in the budgetary process so very stopped as it had wished, but the things *nos go now much better that with the proposal of the Council of Ministers and our figures  *acercan now to the level of 1999.
*Yo Wanted to direct the following observations to the Council and to the Presidency of the Council: it do not takes fault that *nos remember our responsibility in front of the #european taxpayer, neither that also are forced to respect the budgetary discipline.
*Yo Entrust in that the statements of today do not remain  in an isolated gesture and that the Parliament assume also the next year this responsibility to examine *críticamente in #all the commissions #if the resources consigned are using  properly.
In the *marasmo budgetary European there #be not place for two crocodiles: for the crocodile of the European Council and for the crocodile of the European Parliament, the *cual, after having eaten to the Commission demolishing to *Santer, wants now eat to the Council.
Once again, the Council confused the budgetary frame *plurianual, is to say, the financial perspectives, with the own budget: a myopia interested that prevented the suitable political decision and timely and that *nos forces to a processing *renqueante of the budget.
It reflects of reliable form the feel of #a lot of socialist deputies and of other sectors of the Assembly that here attended to offer his testimony in the debate that in the past partial period of September celebrate on the situation in *Timor Oriental.
Finally, in a moment in that *Lusaka *nos remembers the human and economic disasters of the AIDS in *África, are reducing the bottoms that  *le have assigned, *contrariamente to the affirmations of the Commissioner *Nielson, *mezclándolas with the politics of health and natality.
#If we got to some helps that *equivalen to a 50% roughly of the gross national product #kosovar, and #if *nos guide by the highest forecasts, this phenomenon #can produce, *me fear that the consequences, *inflacionarias and #others, on the economy #can surpass to the advantages of the helps.
In this frame, underline that the project of budget of the Council represents less of the 1,10% of the community #GDP, value already of by himself/hisself low and, besides, very inferior to the maximum limit of 1,27% fixed in *Edimburgo and confirmed in *Berlín, it that justifies a deep reflection by part of the one who wishes much more of the European Union.
In the first place, *permítanme mention the extensive conferences of press that the vice-president and *yo same summon immediately after the first meeting of the Council of Government each month, #whose transcriptions, included the of the sessions of questions and answers, are also available in the page *web of the #ECB.
The function of our internal forecasts inside the strategy of politics monetary of the *SEBC differs, therefore, of the function of the forecasts of inflation in a strategy directed directly to the inflation.
To send a clear signal to the banking sector and to the citizens, the #ECB published in September a series of goals that expects fulfil the sector and that they had to contribute to some substantial improvements.
In the actuality, do not seems justified an operative intervention of the #ECB, since already there are indications that it is increasing the general recognition of the problem by part of the private sector.
I do not want to say with #this that it was indispensable the publication of the literal records, but #would be important that #can have of records *resumidas with the arguments -in favour and against-, that allow to appreciate the reasoning that follows in the practice the Central Bank European to determine the risk of inflation or of deflation.
To the Central Bank European *le will result much more difficult to adopt uncomfortable decisions, as for example not dropping the types of interest, but *aumentarlos, *cuando the economic situation go back  more difficult and the stability of the prices see  really loomed.
In his first months of existence, the Central Bank European has won  the confidence, but so that it #can keep firm in his decisions more advance, in circumstances like the described, is necessary that follow consolidating systematically said confidence in the next years, and have *usted the security, gentleman President, that it will put to explain for *ello with the support of my Group.
Nevertheless, I applaud the goals and the coherence of the Report *Huhne like base to define the democratic responsibility of the Central Bank, on the that it wanted to say #some words, in particular on the subject of the transparency and the democratic responsibility.
The third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union puts on the *tapete, of way stronger that in the past, the need of a more robust coordination and more articulated of the economic politics.
The editorial of the resolution #can be interpreted as #if it suggested that *cuando the tax of inflation situate  underneath of the 2% then the system of the Euro #would be under the obligation to support the economic politics generals of the Communities.
Gentleman President, go to take three questions in name of my socialist mates of the Commission of Development, that are here present in spirit but that physically are in the own commission, voting the relative amendments to the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
I agree in that the members of parliament are of course important elements, although #if we take countries like *Somalia, *Sudán and other similar places, are forced to accept the structures of the existent civil society and treat to help to that these structures convert  in components of a society civilised.
In this moment, and from this hemicycle of the new facilities of the European Parliament, my country has the privilege of *hablarle to *Europa, in head of the representatives chosen commonly by the fifteen countries that at present conform the European Union.
The international community is *clarividente and *nos watches with attention; *nosotros, from our own clairvoyance, observe equally it that occurs in the field of the nations and know that it is precise to act now, that there #be not time to lose; we know that it is the moment of the cooperation, no of the confrontation neither neither of the intervention.
It is suitable to award to the greater governmental authorities powers *transfronterizos to pursue to criminals, although the use of these powers will have to be supervised by the European Parliament and the #european courts, of face to consolidate and defend vigorously the civil rights.
Finally, #if well the Council has announced the increase of the competitions and of the mandate of *Europol, necessary instrument to struggle against the delinquency organised, how say of the democratic control and *jurisdiccional, in particular regarding the constitution of files?
The extraordinary meeting of the Council of *Tampere presented  even more difficult to confront because the justice and the subjects of interior took  for the first time to be treated in the diary of the European Union.
His abnegation and his work in the terrain has allowed to re-create a social mesh and has taken to retreat in the daily life the racism, the hate and the contempt.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, when closing the list of orators of the Parliament *me seems that there #be a thing that *me comes to the mind: *ustedes have talked of the spirit of *Tampere and *yo believe that there #be besides a signal of *Tampere.
It is not *superfluo expect that, at the end of the year 2000, #can take out in the new Treated the institutional consequences of the decisions that #can adopt of here to then, with the spirit of Colony, for the security and the defence of the #european continent.
The first reform will appease the fears of the citizens that they produce  increasingly transfers of sovereignty, and the *segunda #would have to encourage to the citizens to take part of a more evident mood to the hour to choose among the political options that  *nos present in *Bruselas and *Estrasburgo.
#Some of *ellas the consider perfectly viable, for example, those directed to simplify the Treaties or the proposal that in the future the general norm has to be the qualified majority decisions in the Council and the *codecisión of the Parliament.
His method: the Council of Colony, the past month of June, denied  to appoint a group of work restricted to prepare the work of review of the Treaty.
I consider that it more indicated had been can vote this amendment because, especially in a so delicate matter like the security *vial, is to say, the protection of the life of the citizens, #would have been able to be very useful.
With the adoption of this amendment open the door to the resumption of the discussion with the Council on the future statute of the deputies to the European Parliament, with the hope that said statute adopt  what before.
The Governments of the EU have agreed to create a common space of justice to combat the common problem of the crime organised, especially the drug trafficking and the traffic of human beings.
Besides, the British that have to face up to judicial problems out of his country will have now an easier access to the justice, included the access to legal help and services of translation, and to procedures simplified by the that they govern  the compensation and the claim of debts.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, want to begin my intervention, like representative of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, in the debate on the restructuring of the companies with the message of the employees of *Michelin, that, to my understand, comports three *noes, although it dislike to my colleague Mr. *Pronk.
In the first place, some direct links among the public helps and agreements that collect a reduction of the labour day with financial sanctions for the companies that do not respect his commitments, *cuando have received public bottoms.
Gentleman President, *yo celebrate that this debate develop  today here because the Parliament has to be permanently attack to the needs of the citizens and be avant-garde in the #european construction; and, to fulfil this double goal, the development of the social dimension of *Europa *me seems fundamental.
Already there are proposals of the European Parliament on the two directives to the that have referred , the directive on the commission of the #european company and the directive on the collective dismissals.
It forbids #all type of essays nuclear in any place, also the nuclear explosions peaceful calls, the *cuales were object of a warmed up theoretical discussion in the birth of the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms in the years 60.
The wonderful newspaper *International *Herald *Tribune publishes today a summary of the intervention that made takes some days in the Council of Relations External the adviser of the President for the national security, *Sandy *Berger.
This proposal that, casually, has obtained the support of the European Parliament and of my country, *Irlanda, presents a new mood to think on how adopt effective measures that defend the cause of a world without nuclear arms.
Never I have believed that suppress the help to the persons affected by the war, that see  affected by the political decisions that adopt his rulers, went the suitable form to answer to the crisis.
Although #all the participants in the diverse stages of the process had present these worries, observed  that the points of sight of the Council and of the Commission, by a part, and, by #another, this Parliament were not entirely *sintonizados.
It will be a new point of game for our villages, that expect that, apart from the economic actions, put to the man, the culture, the roots, the diversities that constitute the wealth of *Europa in the centre of our worries.
The program proposed remained blocked during seven months in the Council until under the #german Presidency, on 28 June got  at last to a result by means of a common position, consistent in a proposal of program *quinquenal endowed of 350 millions of euros.
By means of the collaboration in the programs with participants of diverse States members, the youngsters discover the #european reality in his social and cultural diversity and open  to new perspectives, it that increases enormously the wishes to learn a foreign language.
I have to underline also the attitude, very positive, of the #finnish Presidency, that also has taken all it possible so that they advance the works and believe that the cooperation established among the institutions to take advance the negotiation it before possible is in exemplary truth.
Here they have to act the different speakers to the most diverse levels and *me cheers that the Commission have made a really fine proposal to #mine suggestion, consistent in planting a clearly visible Link in his *Homepage.
Allow to *Turquía take part in the programs "#Socrates" and "Youth" , in consequence, do not involves to award legitimacy to a State that still has not given concrete samples of maturity regarding the respect of the rights of the minorities, but contributes to help to these youngsters to stress his slow and difficult process.
The question is #if #this has to be treated here, or was after a discussion in the Commission of Control Budgetary, or #if it has to debate  thoroughly in a discussion on the reform of the Commission in his whole in #all the notable commissions.
After the discussion in the Commission of Budgets and with the group of the competent commissions for opinion, have reached some as a whole satisfactory proposals for #all, but to coast to brush the limit of the *margen.
We do not have the necessary majority to accept the inclusion of a reference to the annex in the own Internal Regulation, but still have to decide #if we want to add to our Regulation the agreement *interinstitucional in himself/hisself.
Regarding the point 11 of the report of *Virrankoski, believe that the Parliament, by his part, already engaged  the past spring to renew his Regulation so that the diets by trips will be rewarded in function of the real costs.
The Council introduces the quantities allocated to the development of initiatives for the deepening of the Union *Aduanera EU-*Turquía and for the social and economic development of *Turquía, without posing the known political conditions, so that they approve  later, and without *vincularlas to actions related with the earthquakes.
Like member of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, have been particularly attack to the evolution of the *rúbrica 4, allocated to fund the external actions of the Union and to favour the help to the development.
This new articulation of the #european cultural cooperation *reviste a very particular importance in #day of the negotiations of *Seattle, that *me fear will not leave to boost the North American cultural hegemony.
The national frames of regulation differ notably in occasions, by technical and climatological reasons, mainly, it that conducts to a fragmentation of the market in the breast of the European Union in an incompatible grade with the only market.
Firstly, the privatisation of the rail networks, specifically regarding his maintenance, poses grave problems for the security, it that involves an increase of the accidents, causing sometimes true human catastrophes, as we finish to see in the Realm Joined.
Gentleman President, so only some brief notes -since in name of my Group will take part to continuation our colleague #Salvador *Jové *Peres- to say that #this is a subject that earns particular importance and a big actuality so much by it that means regarding the supply of fish as by the number of places of direct and indirect work affected.
The agreement has to, as, look for inside the respect of the common identities, of the sovereignties and of the respect of it that we are, #one and #others, recognising that the history has taken of *Marruecos #if no a cultural exception, at least a #mediterranean exception for *Europa, in general, and for *Francia, in particular.
To this *respecto, #would suit to take into account three factors: first, the fruits and vegetables cultivate  in the European Union in zones #where also the employment is a need *acuciante; second, the fruits and vegetables use  frequently like coin of change in the commercial agreements with third countries and, third, in the last reform of this sector dismantled  important public instruments of management of markets.
The problem of *Marruecos is essentially with *España, #everyone knows it, the #spanish fleet is #a lot of greater, the Spaniards fish in competition with the Moroccans; the #portuguese fleet is smaller, by it that our fishing do not competes with the of the Moroccans.
And, in name of the principle of subsidiariness, *eso is it that ask with seen to the reflection on the review of the Politics *Pesquera Common: a country member of the Politics *Pesquera Common has to can *concertar bilateral agreements with third countries, always that there are not agreements among the European Union and #that third countries.
The sector explains roughly with 40.000 workers and, therefore same, an international agreement like the agreement with *Marruecos exerts a fundamental paper in the supply of the consumers and the industries of transformation with products *pesqueros to reasonable prices.
Finally, a note about the paper of the Parliament that will have to see to the deputies like observers associated to #all the procedures of negotiation, so as to watch by the interests of the fleet of fishing #european.
It is to say, the elimination of the called material of risk do not contributes an absolute security, although it do not leave to be a measure of security, since the open animals in channel are susceptible to transmit the infection.
We have got finally of a period of conditions very demanding established by the European Union for the industry of the bovine, conditions that fulfilled , and therefore the Commission has to apply *decididamente the lifting of the prohibition to the exports of bovine.
Along the debate the President of the Commission, the Mr. *Prodi, put of self-evident that bear *él the alimentary security constitutes #one of the goals *prioritarios, and the Commission wants to and has to open a new page in the politics of the consumers.
A specific debate of the Parliament that carried to the formulation of a political trial on the behaviour of the one who was, #would be absurd and especially #would not favour the good global operation of the #european Institutions.
Gentleman President, have enjoyed for real with #some of the interventions of today, in particular with the initial speech of the Mr. *Donnelly, that seemed to be a criticism of the inability, by part of the #french Governments and British, to give #any solution to this commercial war that goes in increase.
#Such as it has announced it the Commissioner *Fischler, the Commission will send to his *Señorías the pertinent documents this afternoon, before the conference of press, to *través of the electronic post, and also will be able to  consult in the intranet of the Parliament.
*Le Have been allocated 10,3 millions of euros, that definitely is a considerable amount, and not even have the guarantee to be able to have of sufficient resources in case that *Angola decree a biological stop for the capture of shrimps.
(*Verts/*ALE). (*FR) Lady Speaker, the truth is that it is not a question of order, but is true that the events  *suceden and *me saw forced to adopt a decision the Friday, *cuando no longer there was nobody to answer to my questions.
"The Committee considers that the measures adopted by the Realm Joined take that the risk for the human health of the plan of export with calendar established result at least comparable with the existent in other States #european members".
It is or it is not true, gentleman Commissioner, that takes a month presented  to the Commission of Agriculture of the European Parliament a project of directive in the that it said  that before the 2003 #can not  indicate the origin of the bovine in the label?
For the first time, they find  around #the same table, to level of the Union, #all the agents: the Council, the Commission, the Central Bank European and the representatives of the speakers of the market of work.
#This reflects clearly that the Central Bank, by his part, is had to take part in an open and direct dialogue, #as well as to argue his points of sight and his methods of performance.
In *tercer place, *me #would enjoy to stand out that the discussion showed clearly the utility of this type of exchange direct, that allows to each #one of the participants express, of direct form, his points of sight and receive the timely answers by part of the remaining participants.
The 500 millions of supplementary euros #whose unblock asks  to the European Bank with the pretext to boost the creation of places of work and the one thousand millions for the #SME of technology advanced will go allocated officially to the investment.
In a society with a division of the very accused work is indispensable a coordination of the activities of the economic agents, well to *través of the market, well through the political planning.
How *sucederá in the future *cuando have a problem in our economy and there #be a grave shaken external or intern and it was necessary to talk with the social speakers and the other economic agents on #some measures maybe unpleasant that have to adopt  in the #european level?
It treats  of an element of a global plan of proposals presented by the Commission the past month of November to try satisfy the lagoons of the sectors that remained excluded of the original directive on the labour day in 1993.
The difficulties that now confront in the Council of Transports with the legislative proposal that the Commission presented owe  directly to that they did not reach  advances on the labour day in the sector of the transport by road.
The length of the time of work forms part, by it other, of the security and health in the place of work, #as well as of the conditions of competition; both looks, competitions of the European Union.
Gentleman President, beyond all doubt, adapt the length of the time of work of the workers of the ships with flag of third countries that use community ports to the length of the of the community ships, is a positive measure.
Have, by part of the capital shipowner, an intensification of the work and of the exploitation of the workers in the sea, with the corresponding *agudización of the problems related with the health and the security in the sea.
I believe that, #if well #all the that form part of this Assembly #would receive with *beneplácito the opportunity to guarantee an environment of work safer, no only for the employees, but also for the consumers and other users of the transport and other, have to watch by no *reglamentar excessively in any sector determined.
#One of the looks that more *les concern is that, as in *Irlanda -and also in Big *Bretaña, for example- exists an archaic system and of feudal type by the that the auxiliary doctors in period of training are apprentices -employ this word in wide sense- of the upper specialists, have fear to pose *demasiadas worries, because *eso #can affect to his future careers.
The ratification of the instruments of the *OIT is, sure enough, a necessary condition to proceed to the inspections on board of foreign ships that take scale in the ports of the States members, which *nos will allow, among other things, avert disloyal competitions inside our own ports precisely.
In this frame, #can not by less of *sumarme to the conclusions of the Commission of Subjects External, Human Rights, Common and Political Security of Defence, because *eso allows a greater freedom of expression for those who work in the scientific and technological sphere in Chinese and in general.
Of #the same mood, wish that the scientific and technological cooperation undertaken cover practical projects of cooperation directed to timely goals and that improve the execution and the productivity of the projects funded, #among others, by the program of *cooperacion in matter of investigation, by the program *TACIS and by the program *INTERREG.
In the actions undertaken up to now, already had taken  upsetting in the formulation of projects of collaboration with other countries of *Mercosur, association in the that Argentinian exerts an important paper, by it that constitutes like a head of bridge for *nosotros concerning other countries of *América Latin.
In our opinion, *ello is due to the fact that the systems of development technological that employ  in the industry of the car hamper global improvements of the product owing to the high specialisation of the laboratories of *I + *D of the companies.
I have to recognise that, although I no longer am a member of parliament of the all *inexperta, the multiplicity of sections in the that is *subdividida: strategic goal, operative goal, goals that expects  achieve, concrete measures of legislative character and no legislative, in reality no *me has facilitated the understanding of the text and of it that wishes *comunicarnos the Commission.
In this moment have a wide community regulation in fifteen States members, fifteen national regulations different and, in #a lot of cases, for example in the federal or almost federal States, #a lot of greater.
Before happening to the last point of my speech wanted to *referirme to an observation of the Mr. *Berenguer *Fust. This deputy has signalled that the defence of the consumer #can not go in detriment of the inner market.
We have tried -and I expect that in some measure have achieved it- create this balance to avert that the defence of the interests of the consumer and the protection of the consumer go in detriment of the inner market.
Without embargo, the #european strategy for the employment, #such as it has elaborated , goes  putting in practice little by little from the summit of *Luxemburgo and characterises  by some debatable ideological foundations and by a little dynamic conception of the institutional procedures.
Thus *nos seems indispensable to evaluate the hit or the failure of the #european strategy for the employment with help of indicators that measure simultaneously the number of unemployed inscribed and the levels of life and the quality of the places of work created.
Had account that to scale #european the politics in matter of employment are political of suggestion, of indication, of impulse of coordination among the States members - therefore, did not exists a true effective power and *decisorio, which, after all, supposes *algo positive in name of the principle of subsidiariness, but a quite limited power - believe that the Parliament #would have to be involved fully.
We do not go back to open now the debate of the another day: the answer is the answer that have *resumido, that remembers the terms of the investigation that proposed and that #all accepted, and that it was made by the General Secretary and that has given this result.
In the first place, I estimate that our intervention, the common intervention of the community Institutions of the States members, in the look of the politics of offer to increase the employment, is important but no sufficient.
In definite, because we follow thinking in the bottom that the market goes to resolve a problem that is not a problem that #can be resolved by the market because it is not a circumstantial problem, is a problem of model of society.
The main obstacle to the creation of employment of quality and with rights is the existence of a Pact of Stability with criteria of nominal convergence that impose limitations to the public investments and condition the economic and social politics.
It has accepted  my amendment to keep an annual rhythm for the review of the guidelines so that the States members do not wane in the active promotion of the employment.
Also I consider *algo problematic the fact that the proposals for the guidelines of the year 2000 begin to treat  before they have carried out entirely, or not even have set up, the concrete measures of the previous guidelines.
We have of sufficient time to be able to treat also this so important report for the future of the European Union already both speakers have taken  creditors that his report was treated in a suitable time?
I believe that #this do not has felt from the point of sight of the national economy *cuando knows  that the oxides of nitrogen and the broadcast of particles belong necessarily to #the same curve and *cuando modifies  #one of the two toxic elements follow  automatically consequences for the #another.
The cycles of proofs for the register of values of broadcast of vehicles will have to be, logically, in the most brief term possible, a representative reflection of the real state of the circulation.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that is today for debate on the broadcasts of gases in the commercial vehicles weighed prolongs, in my opinion, our continued efforts in *pro of the improvement of the quality of the air in *Europa keeping the mobility of our citizens.
We have lost the moral or religious limits, and our capacity of indignation no  awake as it was not in front of facts so visible like the #blue illness on a face, or take  publics through the media.
The actions of the program *DAPHNE have to explain also with the support of the *ONG, as *nosotros same propose in our amendments, with the of the social communication, because the women, that explain  among the #european citizens more reluctant in relation with the European Union, have to know and comprise that programs like *DAPHNE exist and refer  directly to *ellas.
And especially, how measured has intention to adopt to facilitate a political agreement to the *respecto, an agreement that is fundamental so that the Commission, the Council and the Parliament take a definite decision in this matter?
Gentleman President, *me #would enjoy *unirme to the complaint in front of the fact that it still have not presented  by part of the Commission a review of the relative proposal to the information and the query of the workers.
In this context, has to put  especially in the pillory the politics of the Council since in the international Conferences of the countries taxpayers makes continuously costs to charge of the #european budget without concerning  also of the corresponding income.
Already they exist wide zones of consensus on the *cuales #can contribute  to the improvement of the finance of the Union, but the result in the vote of the Commission of Budgets shows that they exist some concepts on the *cuales the consensus is far to produce .
In #this it is necessary to study of special way the granting of the contributions, #as well as the possibility to create a new system of own resources linked directly to the citizens without that *ello suppose an increase of the fiscal pressure.
#This means that tasks like the enlargement of the Union, the respect of the human rights all over the world and the creation of some general conditions to surpass the grave unemployment #can not  make already with this frame.
On 11 March we vote especially in our resolution, a section that said: "it Thinks that the system of income has to be fundamentally free of exceptions and special rules,", etc., etc. Know well it that the Council in *Berlín took of this resolution and on how based the Council his agreement of *Berlín.
But before demanding more autonomy, have to take advantage of #all the potentials of saving in the budget of the EU and explain also to the citizens of the Union reason *nos allow costs for two Parliaments and do not find systems simpler that *desgraven to the citizens of the Union and no the tax even more.
Gentleman President, consider necessary a reform of the system of resources own with seen to a strengthening of the principles of transparency, equity, solidarity and cohesion, with his extension to the sphere of the community income.
But also I say with #all clarity that, in *contrapartida, expect of the States members that increase of the corresponding mood the measures for the control of the own resources and that do not look for more excuses, is to say, that #such measures of control apply  really.
Also I believe that the Commission has been more hit when averting the reference to the nuclear energy in his proposals and wanted to *aconsejarle that  *atenga to this approach, because it is the proposal that more #can cause divisions and, of course, *nosotros #would not agree with *ella.
An important part of this strategy is the fixation of dip *jurídicamente *vinculantes for the renewable energies, but also is very clear that it has to have #one *externalización of the internal costs in relation with the traditional energetic production.
The pressure of the market also affects to the broadcasts of the public services: the foci of resistance more effective to a free competition *desenfrenada, the public companies are loomed.
Finally, the speaker surprises , with #all reason, that the Commission leave totally sideways the nuclear energy *cuando #this contributes to reduce the broadcasts of CO2, even #if this energy has to be safer and more respectful of the environment.
In conclusion, believe that it #can learn  a lot of an exchange of opinions among the States members in matter of energetic politics and support the call of the Mr. *Chichester so that the Commission put of relief examples of optimum methods of integration of the environmental goals in the energetic politics.
The proportion of sources of renewable energy in the European Union will increase inside ten years until a 62 percent. In fact, it results decisive the development of plants combined for the common production of electricity and heat that use the coal and the gas like fuel.
I expect thus that the Commission, *cuando present a new proposal, read his own communication on the *potenciación of the presence of the environment in the community energetic politics and contribute actively to consolidate the employment of sources of renewable energy.
First of all, the of the security of our supplies and the energetic dependency of the European Union, dependency that goes to increase and that runs the risk - *nos says- to reach the 70% in the year 2020, with #all the political risks that of *ello derive .
The European Union has fixed  like goal increase the part of these last of the 6 to the 12% for the year 2010, but is precise to find the financial means and, today day, is  far to reach it, to judge by the last discussions in the commission of conciliation.
Undoubtedly, *Señorías, east is a debate to the that it is necessary *dedicarle #all the attention, and expect that, along the next months and, of course, before it finish the mandate of this Commission, #can develop it with *plenitud, with transparency, with intensity and with quality in the discussions, as it has been the case of the discussion of this report.
My husband -the Dr. #Rhys *Jenkins, at present general doctor and that has a labour day limited- worked in the past more of 100 hours to the week in the period of training to get to be doctor.
With regard to this last subject, the initial proposal of the European Commission proposed that the doctors in period of training went in in the field of application of the Directive by means of a transitory period of seven years.
In this way it will take  possible the creation of a juridical space European that transmit at last to the #european citizens in #all the EU a common feeling of juridical security and guarantee a unitary civil state in #all *Europa.
Up to now they have arisen problems in the marriages *binacionales in the European Union by the fact that documents that certify the civil state when contracting marriage have not been recognised of #the same mood by #all the States members.
It is hit to entrust to the Court of Justice the task to define the notion of responsibility parental, *cuando the proposal of regulation foresaw that it took  reference to the internal right of the Been member interested?
So that it was not a vain word, the circulation of the persons in the European Union has to go accompanied of the necessary measures in the sphere of the right of family.
Now that the application of the directive on the nitrates poses when seeming problems in *tantos States members, is had the Commission to proceed to a new *concertación on his improvement and progressive application with seen to reach the norm requested for the nitrates?
Gentleman *Dell' #Alba, signalled that four countries, of the twelve countries interested in the Goal 2, had been object of a first decision of principle of the Commission, of the eight countries that remain, the situation of the Federal Republic of *Alemania almost is finalised in the discussions that have had.
From 1997 the Commission has the committed of the execution of the action *DAPHNE, allocated specifically to the fight against the violence that suffer the women, the teenagers and the boys, to the that *sucederá the program (today same approved) *DAPHNE - 2000-2003, that has #the same goal.
The Commission expects the opinions of the Parliament and of the States members to elaborate the proposals of action back with seen to the achievement of the goals of the communication to the that finish of *referirme.
At the end of this year, no only we will be able to evaluate the advances of the national legislation to protect to the victims of offences violent, but also the concrete measures that each #one of the States members are had to apply.
In effect, the Commission has loaned, from takes varied years, a special attention to the development of the provinces of the north of *Marruecos, with occasion of the execution of the technical and financial cooperation with the Realm of *Marruecos.
#If I achieve the backrest by part of the Commission, it that pretends  is to promote a group of high level #where #would take part the main civil managers, and even #would have also that have the soldiers, to help to the Commission to develop the suitable orientations.
As it will know the Assembly, the High Representative enjoys of a high and very deserved international reputation for having defended the values that inscribe  among it better of the #european history of this century and #whose lack has been also the *causante of it worse of our history.
The at the same time Minister of External Subjects and Boss of the Defence of the European Union, Mr. #Solana, said well to the clear that the meeting of the Monday in *Bruselas was decision so that the EU -as it said his representative- occupy in the world-wide scene the place that *le corresponds.
It keeps  an attitude twisted and liar on the situation of *Kosovo in the political context and of the international Right and first of all this action shows how the small countries have seen  stuck to the car of the allies.
And, in this sense, *me #would enjoy to know #which is the opinion that *le deserve the relations among the European and Chinese Union, especially to the light of the commercial agreement recently concluded among the States Joined and this country.
The decisions of Colony do not owe *conducirnos to that a day *nos find in #the same situation that Swiss, my *segunda homeland, #where after studying the threats of the year 2000 got  to the conclusion that they were very prepared to face up to dangers that no longer existed.
The *CPN exists still, but the problem was and follow being that there #be not neither in the Commission neither in the Council an able structure to take advantage of of effective way the experiences and the knowledges of the *CPN and of other organisms.
*Nos Have endowed, after the Summit of Colony, of new instruments -#one has to see with the common strategies- that have to mean, without any doubt, a change in depth in the mood to focus the external politics.
*Les #Can say that, by part of the European Union, morning and the day after tomorrow will take all it possible so that the Organisation for the Security and Cooperation in *Europa exert an important paper, to the height of his obligations, in a moment in the that it goes  to sign a new Letter of Security in *Europa.
Like this, for example, the fundamental labour norms and the social clauses #would have to contemplate  in the frame of a forum of work mixed *OIT/*OMC, and #this #would have to incorporate  and take in consideration in the debates, without modifying nevertheless the rule of the *OMC.
In *tercer place, that respect  the denominations of origin of the traditional community products, so that we do not see more this authentic piracy that practises  with impunity with the community marks, as, by it other, *sucede at present in *Sudáfrica with the wine of Port, the sherry, the *uzo or the *grappa.
The Commission of Development wants some rules of the *OMC that do not hamper the plans of labeling ecological neither the shopping of products biological by part of the public.
The excellent report of *Konrad *Schwaiger -#worthy of consensus and of a majority support- leaves clear that it that  *dirime is *algo more that the commercial politics, it that is in game is the participation in foot of equality of #all the countries, the social progress and the respect of the human rights.
#This has to include, like minimum, the automatic parliamentary right to subject to approval any agreement of the *OMC, #as well as an a lot greater access to the summaries of the negotiations in the breast of the Council.
To #the same time, the Group *ELDR has resisted  to #all the attempts to overload the present report with a list of the purchase of requests specific of the sectors.
We need a free access of tariffs for the less developed countries, no only for practically #all the products - is a sentence that leaves opened a giant lagoon so that the EU follow protecting his own agriculture - but for #all the products of said countries.
Boosted by this recent precedent and #waiting for a true balance of the cycle precedent, *nos seemed urgent to expect before *lanzarnos to body discovered to a negotiation #whose advantages are entirely without testing and #whose rules of the game, with #all evidence, do not seem #the same for the European Union and for our main partner and competitor, States Joined.
Report (To5-0052/1999) of the Mrs. *Haug, in name of the Commission of Budgets, on the proposal of decision of the Council (*COM(1999) 333 - *C5-0092/1999 - 1999/0139(*CNS)) relative to the system of resources own of the European Union
In *tercer place, wanted to that the Table *me cleared #if the reason by the that goes to proceed to the vote of the amendment *nº 31 before the amendment *nº 9 roots in the section 2 of the article 130 of our Regulation, or was, that this amendment moves away more of the original.
It had been better to find a solution under the form of a mechanism of correction generic, for example, by means of the introduction of a band for the national contributions to the EU.
The region is *asolada by the war and in the meantime the commitment of the European Union increases by the humanitarian helps and by the finance of the project *TRASECA to join the #Black sea and the #Asia central.
Gentleman President, believe that, in so much Parliament, have to adopt a very clear posture and manifest our support to the population *chechena and, by this reason, believe that it is important that the President of the European Parliament receive to the Minister *checheno of External Subjects for *informarle of our posture.
It is a very difficult question *cuando, as it has said the speaker to the principle, of it that treats  is not to bet by the free trade, but to bet by a free just trade.
In our conception, the respect by the fundamental rights of the workers has like reason to be a distribution more *equitativa of the benefits of growth that contributes the liberalisation of the exchanges.
*Yo *le Answered it same that go to say today here, that this is not the moment of the solutions neither of the proposals, but the moment to see of how goes  to occupy the Conference *Intergubernamental and #which is the method that goes to follow in his works.
It results *inquietante, alarming even, it that is preparing  in the field of the external political call and of security, the vehemence with that leaves  sideways the up to now civil character of the #european integration and pretends  create a military Union.
In the first place, it is indispensable that the reform that wishes  was democratic and *democratizadora, is to say, that subordinate the *burócratas to the representatives chosen and #this to his national public opinions and that strengthen  his democratic legitimacy by means of the participation of the national parliaments and do not remain *substituida by associations of doubtful representativeness or of expert suppositions.
By this reason, the #nordic left will vote against of the greater part of this proposal of resolution that, among other things, involves more shots *supranacionales, that limits the influence in the diverse treaties and that increases the domination of the great states.
I believe that we #would have to learn the lesson of this error of the past and recognise that the importance of this enlargement in particular, the reunification of the #european family, is *algo that the societies of our corresponding countries have to know during the celebration of the *CIG.
This report tries to continue the development of the Union like an Alliance of States centralised, and do not takes in account at all of how mood will influence a so intense enlargement in the institutional development of the Union.
As in this case *nos move in the constitutional sphere and like the Treaty follows being the upper norm of our internal rights, in the future it will be necessary to attach to a greater juridical precision.
It is important that #can have an approach integrated that it tackle #all the looks of the reform, from the substantial questions related with the decision by majority until the reform of the institutions and the treatment of subjects essential.
We are in front of a substantial modification of the national sovereignty all over the world since the freedom of action of the countries is limited, so much to out as to inside, and his capacity to elaborate political and solve problems sees  restricted by the international relations and the *interdependencias and transnational interactions.
The European Union supports, in general, the work that the *PNUCD makes of constant and effective form in the field of the drugs, and also are very satisfied with the collaboration of the European Union and the *PNUCD in other terrains.
*Nosotros, citizens and deputies of the European Parliament, are extremely concerned because we do not see concrete signals that the Commission go to present a proposal of this nature during the #finnish Presidency, since *nosotros of fine wins had begun his processing.
#Which is the opinion of the Council on a federalism in that the different States members renounce to the right of veto and to the criteria of majority qualified to facilitate the adoption *supranacional of decisions?
The enlargement of the frame of decisions that are adopted by qualified majority in the breast of the Council is #one of the subjects that will be debated by the representatives of the Governments in the Conference *Intergubernamental, that will summon  at the beginning of the year 2000.
My parliamentary commission has encouraged  a lot for preparing the answer of the Parliament to the proposal to time to fulfil the term fixed by the Council and to time so that the Council #can *examinarla on 2 December.
Therefore, gentleman President, believe that with the amendments that have introduced in the Commission of Subjects Constitutional fulfil the goal to accommodate a decision of the three institutions to the own characteristics of the #ours.
Gentleman *Prodi, Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, will expose the point of sight of the Greens and the European Free Alliance on *Eurodac. I have to admit that after the introduction of the speaker *Pirker the nuances introduced by the previous orators have been of my like.
So that any unilateral solution, or any solution of character administrative that did not contemplate in #all his dimensions the authentic problem of public health and the medical looks of the subject #would constitute a *craso error.
*Nosotros Are adherents no only of the total transparency with regard to the operation of #all the #european institutions, but also to the election and to the *revocabilidad, in any moment, so much of #all #that that today are deputies, as of #all those that possess a responsibility, independently of the hierarchical level that it treat , including the Commission of *Bruselas.
Besides, had account of the course *desfavorable reserved to the amendments that have presented with my colleagues of the #french socialist delegation and the Groups *GUE/*NGL and Green/*ALE, *me have abstained, lady Speaker, in the vote of the report of the Mr. *Schwaiger.
This absence of balance #can analyse like a will to hide, according to the assessment of the villages of the countries *adherentes to the *OMC, the evidence of the effects of the *desreglamentación of the world-wide trade.
This dimension of a just trade based in the absence of a *dumping qualitative, environmental, social and fiscal, #if well it mentions  in the plane of the principles, is not confirmed, with #all his consequences, like a goal *prioritario of the #european negotiators.
*Yo Have billed the principles for *ello in a dissident opinion, *aneja to the Report *Dimitrakopoulos-*Leinen, and the Group *Europa of the Nations has developed his consequences presenting *veintiuna amendments, that have been refused, alas, by the majority of this Parliament.
Our conviction consists in that the future belongs to a *Europa without borders among villages unified of an extreme to #another of the continent and released of the can in fact of the industrial and financial groups, indispensable condition for a real control of the villages regarding his institutions.
- (OF) In the frame of the reform of the main institutional fields of the Treaties the proposals contained in the Report *Dimitrakopoulos-*Leinen plead by an enlargement of the decision by qualified majority in the Council.
We have observed with big satisfaction that the #danish government communicated in the meeting of the Council (Justice and Inner Subjects) celebrated on 29 October 1999 his will to take part fully in the cooperation *Eurodac on a base *interestatal.
The repatriation of the persons displaced is in course: before yesterday, of the total of persons displaced, around 65.000 had returned, and the #indonesian Government *nos has ensured that the process of repatriation voluntary will finalise inside 100 days.
Therefore I understand, gentleman President, that *nosotros, like European Parliament, have to manifest, in this occasion and in #all #that in the that produce  an alike fact, a firm and indeclinable commitment with the right to the life, as we take it in the text of this common resolution.
*Nos Seems an enormous cruelty, *aterradora, that think  in executing to patients of this class and that have  to persons 21 years in the prison, as it is the case of a Canadian to the that was foreseen to execute and half hour before the execution accepted  a #his resource in front of the court.
The *MINUK has directed  to the Commission, with regard to funding the body of protection of *Kosovo, and the next week the States members will take a decision on the program that have suggested in answer to this request.
We were a bit proud to having contributed with our help -although it remains for seeing #if it has got to his destination- to the creation of this Court that owed *esclarecer the crimes against the humanity and punish to his authors.
#Many of these projects apply  through *ONG and tend to improve the scope and the quality of the services of the social sector, particularly in the fields of the primary education and of the sanitary attention.
They have presented  128 amendments, and *usted has drafted so only 17 or 18 amendments of transaction, that have to serve for *aunar this quantity of amendments proposed so that at the end it go out of this Parliament a logical and conclusive report on this Plan of action.
To these two groups, the adherents of the #swedish model and the adherents of the #dutch model, no *les interests a narrow #european collaboration in this terrain because they fear that it will go in detriment of his national politics.
*Ello Means that countries like *Francia and *Alemania owe *redoblar his efforts in the field of the treatment of the *toxicómanos whereas a country like the Low Countries, for example, has to put more obstinacy in the fight against the excessive presence of the drugs by cause of the "*coffeeshops" and against the tourism of the drug.
We have to confront the fact that the criminal strengths involved in the production and the traffic of drugs are connected among yes, have of resources, have strengths that exceed in a lot the possibilities of the states of right to detain this traffic.
It has got the moment that we consider the suitability to subtract resources to the fight against the supply of drugs and to increase the resources allocated to the fight against the demand.
*Cuarta: Boost the cooperation among the cities, *basándonos in the idea of the *European *Cities *Drug *Policy like model of a project, that recognises to the legal - and illegal drugs - like pertaining to the society and pronounces  in favour of a consumption of these autonomous and responsible drugs.
#If to *ello join the remarkable increase that has come  observing in the consumption of drinks alcoholic by part of youngsters, that in #a lot of cases joins  to the consumption of drugs, especially of synthesis, puts  of self-evident the need of an urgent adoption of measures that invest this tendency.
It treats  of the period that passes until the year 2003, according to my just proposal until 31 January of the 2003, then #would take place an intermediate evaluation and a new estimate and respectively a prolongation until 31 January of the 2007.
The effect *multiplicador of the banking guarantee takes that the resultant investments of the credits of the *BEI have a decisive importance in the frame of the politics subsidised by the community budget.
Gentleman President, want to explain the favourable vote to the Inform Newton *Dunn underlining that #the same, with his measures, places  in the fight against the illegal immigration and against the numerous acts of delinquency that #many of the immigrated illegal, by *fas or by *nefas, commit in damage of #all the citizens of the European Union and in particular of the elderly citizens.
The Record of adhesion of 1985 contained an evolutionary clause -the section 4 of the article 25- so as to avert that, like consequence of the development of the European Union, Canarian #can remain out of the #european construction.
The dismantlement of the #canarian fiscal specificities in matter *arancelaria #would put in danger the dismantlement of a series of small local industries -industries of the feeding, tobacco, small industries of commercial type-, that #would disappear #if it suppressed  entirely this small protection that *nos provided the *arbitrios special Canarians, specifically the *arbitrio on the production and the import.
There #be had public demonstrations in favour and against of the full incorporation of the islands, have produced  crisis of Government and even the resignation of the president of an autonomic Government, that had like cause, precisely, the conditions of negotiation of the adhesion.
The exhibition of reasons and the explanation that today *nos has given the speaker are clear and establish the long path that Canarian has followed in *Europa to get to the process of incorporation to the European Union.
In necessary case, the Commission will present a proposal to the Council based in the Article 299 (2) on the necessary measures not to engage the existence of some local activities particularly fragile.
From three years ago, more specifically, I have expressed in varied occasions to the Commission my worry by the distortions of the competition to world-wide level, aggravated by the fact that *Europa has imposed  always an unknown rigour for our opponents.
Up to now, in spite of the varied calls made in this sense because the subject is not new, the European Union and the Commission have not taken at all effective to put end to this indirect subvention in *Corea.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the industry of the construction and the naval repair of the European Union confronts grave problems, as already it has said  here, it that shows that the formulas applied takes some years are not giving the results promised.
To the contrary of it that said the European Council in 1998, *cuando *reglamentó the new relative norms to the helps to the naval construction, at the end did not improve the conditions of competition international.
The reality is the that it is and, regretting it a lot, gentleman Commissioner, #if they do not adopt  urgent and forceful measures, this sector, like other industrial sectors of the European Union, goes  to go to the derive, for keeping the owed composure in the way to talk.
*Yo Wanted to also *sumarme to the conviction that is expressing  here, in this #european forum, with regard to the split of the truce by part of the organisation ETA, and want to express my total rejection to the utilisation of the violence to achieve political goals.
Of course, it is very positive can listen now a big number of opinions on this important problem, but also #can observe that other colleagues begin to manifest likewise his wish to take part and, therefore, *yo believe that we #would have to begin to work usually in the frame of the agenda. The Commission is present.
The Commissioner commissioned of the education and the youth will put the programs *Socrates, #Leonardo and Youth to disposal of the training, of the collaboration among the youngsters, so that the anti-doping fight was *algo wished by the youths of *Europa.
They are yielding activities and, considered from this point of sight, believe that the Commission #can at least try regulate a bit the sector and his conditions of work, since, as it has said very *atinadamente the Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit, #if the sportsmen dope  is because the competitions demand it.
As *usted finishes to say, the sport occupies an important place in the #european daily life and, therefore, has to occupy it also in the European Parliament, as it said the President *Prodi in his inaugural speech.
First of all they exist the specifically mentioned subjects in *Amsterdam, #this is, the future of the Commissioners, the representation of the States members in the Council and the extension of the vote by qualified majority.
*Yo Wanted to remember likewise the importance that the Presidency summon a new #european Conference that *insufle new life to this forum and that the countries that in the future will be members of the EU take part from this time on in the remodeling of the European Union.
The Conference *Intergubernamental, the *concretización of the external politics and of common security and the realisation controlled of the enlargement are subjects that require a preparation in depth, so much by part of the aspiring countries to the adhesion, as by part of the European Union.
And the worry is still greater *cuando to defend the review that wants to take , is to say, the of the famous institutional triangle, resorts  to the argument of the efficiency and no to the global vision of the #european project.
With regard to the widest subject relative to the realisation of the inner market, *permítame say also that during the #finnish Presidency have received #some strategic documents very important, and the Community #would owe really *darles #a lot of more priority of the that *les gives in these moments.
The contribution of this report for the future is that no only occupies  of political decisions, but that also of the paper of the society in the creation of a climate in the that the human rights have permanent and deep popular rooting.
Since the European Council confirmed in December of 1997 that *Turquía #can opt to the entrance in the EU, has come  working in creating the conditions to loan financial help of face to promote the economic collaboration and *acercar to *Turquía to the EU.
Although there was *algún shy attempt by part of the #turkish Government, the recent sentence to the pity of death dictated against the leader *kurdo *Ocalan has moved away all possible political approach of *Turquía to the European Union.
Also I want to manifest, nevertheless, my special gratitude to the #greek Government and to the Minister of Subjects External *Papandreu, that have stepped brave, also from the point of sight of the political situation intern.
I believe that the European Parliament has to keep his posture; we have to *propiciar that *ingrese in the European Union no only *Turquía, has to *ingresar also the #turkish village in the European Union, and have to take part so that in this path this village access to the rights that it is deprived.
The electrical head offices, the facilities of incineration of waste, the ovens of cement and the cars offer possibilities to the hour to reduce the broadcasts of monoxide of carbon.
The subject goes much more there of the *benceno and the monoxide of carbon and, therefore, has to be analysed in a wider frame and from a technical perspective; the Directive 96/62 defines the environmental air only like the "air acclimatise" .
And also we want that it analyse , in the report that the Commission has to present to the Council and to the European Parliament, #if the reduction that #can have to broadcasts of CO2 has to  to the technical measures of the industrial or to the habits of the consumers.
Therefore, they allow that we complete the directive these three points, so that we #can have of a truly effective instrument to control the fulfillment of the voluntary commitment, that in fact is an experiment for the European Union.
Gentleman President, has checked  that the index of substances organic harmful in the seaboard and in high sea of the Gulf of *Finlandia increases, in general, eastwards, which reflects the influence of the poured *contaminantes pertinent of *Rusia in the index of substances harmful in the *Báltico.
But there #be a very important point that have to take into account: in the exhibition of reasons specified  that it guaranteed  the external quality of the materials; without embargo, the point *d) of the Annex *VII treats it of mood very generic.
The experience *nos has shown that, from determined sizes, the plant do not has any possibility to survive in a half, as it occurs in #a lot of zones of the south of *Europa, in that the conditions of drought are very extreme.
The euro do not constitutes #one dip in himself/hisself same, but an instrument to the service of the citizen, of a strong economy, of the employment, of the international position of the European Union.
The considering *K, in the that it collects  a complaint on the nonexistence of advantages practical immediate of the banking euro, is a trace of the high hopes that had the majority of the Parliament and that, apparently, continues having.
With reason insists the speaker in the need of an accurate preparation for the introduction of the euro and *nosotros go to see that the euro will obtain really the confidence of the citizens and of the citizens and no only the of the markets since , meanwhile, finds  already *asentado in #this.
But it is not less true -and also has put  of relief along the debate- that the moment of the reality, the moment of the truth, will be *cuando go in in vigour the coins and the notes: on 1 January of the 2002.
The situation of the market, no only regarding the negotiations of the *OMC, and the new understanding of the traditional habits by the new persons will modify also the contents and the importance of the subjects in the commission.
Seen that -and already has remembered  this morning- according to the data facilitated by the Commission, the 60% of the products *pesqueros that consume  in the European Union are mattered, #would be necessary to back considerable and amply the aquaculture that represents an important economic opportunity for the maritime communities.
Nevertheless, it is extremely important that the proposal treat also the requirements in matter of the information that on the quality of the air has to provide  to the public opinion splitting of a very accurate follow-up of the level of *benceno and of monoxide of carbon.
The surveys of opinion show, in effect, at least in *Francia, that the percentage of persons that propose  open an account in euros in a next future, diminishes regularly from 1 January 1999, and today only affects to a small minority.
But the European Parliament wishes *sacarlos of his error and *preconiza once again a campaign of information that, quote the resolution approved, "answer to the practical questions and explain the basic meaning of the monetary union".
Regarding the period that initiates  on 1 January 2002, in that they will circulate simultaneously two coins, period that, in the terms of the Treaty, #can extend until six months, share the opinion of the Mrs. Speaker and of the Council *Ecofin, according to the *cual this period #would have to reduce to two months.
Change the *OMC affects, finally, to his mood of operation current, that follows based in the diplomacy of the summits and of the secret in the moment of the citizen irruption in the subjects of the world.
A proof is the supremacy in the taking of decisions of some #few *decenas of rich countries. Another proof is the increase of the inequalities among rich and poor countries, and also in the interior of the own countries.
*Europa, finally, do not has to forget to defend our specificities no only economic, but also cultural and social, because the globalisation of the uniformity, of the *achatamiento and of the exploitation do not has to form part at all of the model of development #european.
Now well, #all know that, without a special deal for the agriculture, will not be possible to guarantee a minimum of preference community, neither, therefore, the guarantee of the primary productive function of the agriculture.
They have put  of self-evident two things.: The first is that in the future will follow contemplating this *mescolanza of interests in the frame of the international negotiations, and wanted to *sumarme to the posture of #a lot of notable economists that affirm that #this has not been more that the beginning.
Now well, for *nosotros, do not treats  to organise better the continuous release of the exchanges, but to give primacy to the defence of the social and environmental rights and allow to #all the populations control by himself/hisself same and decide his future.
The present report claims the resignation forced of a Commission neglected and #amateurish, and has revealed a catalogue of irresponsibilities of the States members that are had to criticise, but no to act against of the fraud and of the irregularities.
To finalise want to underline that the Commission follows thinking -as it says the report that *usted *nos presents- to use as main indicator of the hit of his financial management the grade of utilisation of the financial credits assigned in the annual budget.
Gentleman President, the report of 1998 of the Court of Accounts, that has been debated in #all *Europa except -until today- in this Assembly, shows the clear need that the Commission and the States members intensify his efforts in the fight against the fraud.
In my opinion, is hit that it exist a temporary distance among the publication and the debate here in the Assembly so that #all the deputies have of the possibility to know the whole of the report.
It has been an especially bad season for the Commission and a particularly difficult stage to advance by #all the normal channels, since had elections, the difficulties of the Commission, #etcetera.
The subject of the finance and of the cast of the financial charges has to be the subject of a debate in the widest frame of the regional organisations of fishing.
It treats  of a common work of the European Parliament, that took the initiative, and of the Commission, that with the place of the compensation has improved considerably the original proposal of the Parliament.
We are not had to happen of this philosophy of right imperative to #another absolutely uncertain and very little favourable for the #european citizen, to a diagram of subscription voluntary.
It wanted to give the thanks to *Willi *Rothley, the speaker, by the excellent preparation of this report and by the initiative that then also had arisen of the Parliament. But also *le give the thanks to the Commission and to the Council by his substantial approval.
I believe that the report of the Mr. *Rothley has to be approved in his group, since it is a commitment of high level and the synthesis of a series of stimuluses and innovative concepts, fruit of the collaboration among the distinct institutional instances.
According to this agreement, Swiss authorises a maximum number of community trucks of commodities of more of 28 tonnes that will be able to cross Swiss until the year 2005, date in that this country, adapting his rule to the community, will not demand permission #any for the inferior trucks to 40 tonnes.
To the project of application of the agreement of transport among the EU and Swiss that starts now knot the hope that in the future was easier the *superación of the alpine central space.
When inviting to *Turquía to an increasingly narrow cooperation, the Union acts of agreement to his fundamental mission to consolidate the peace and to boost the fulfillment of the human rights.
Without embargo, in the relative conclusions to the fiscal subject ratified  that #all the resident citizens in the States of the Union will have to pay the applicable taxes to the performance of #all the savings.
The prevention of the conflicts with military means is not always preferential, and by each euro invested in the military management of crisis it is necessary to invest at least another euro in the no military management of crisis.
The step that has given  in direction to the opening of the negotiations with six new States candidates and the recognition of *Turquía as Been candidate form indispensable part of the #european politics to consolidate the stability and the welfare in our continent.
After the unanimous decision on the process of enlargement #can not and do not has to *subsistir any doubt regarding the seriousness of our will and the will of *Turquía that they fulfil  it prompter possible the criteria of *Copenhague.
It treats  of minimum progresses, but *les guarantee -and #this is the important message that want to give- that in this sense the Commission and the President of the Parliament have kept a same line to expand the presence of the Parliament.
*Yo Expect that the Commission loan an authentic support in this context, in the sense of the contribution to the peace and to the prevention of conflicts in the region, which is, in effect, much more important that the troops decided in *Helsinki.
The reforms allocated to boost a dynamic competition and the flexibility have to be compatible with the requirement of the maintenance, but at the same time also of a modernisation of the systems of security social.
The work has not finished with the Summit of *Helsinki, that has developed  of way very satisfactory regarding this subject and in the that #Grecia, especially, has kept a very remarkable attitude and *Turquía also has acted of reasonable way to end of accounts.
But it suits that we say here that we do not accept that the European Parliament remain in a position *subalterna in any process of debate so important like a review of the Treaty of the European Union of this importance.
In the budgets that are treating, the European Parliament increases the number of new civil servants of a way that is not in accordance with the financial austerity. It is not it, at least, in comparison with the increases of the last five years.
#All *nosotros have to *adaptarnos to this new and -create *yo- hopeful methodology of work with the Commission, that is the free debate, but, as it knows His *Señoría, in accordance with the regulations this free debate, in this occasion, has to see directly -and therefore it has created - with the statement that the Commission finishes to take and the subjects in *ella tackled.
Taking into account the important consequences that #can have this subject, the Commission will take a follow-up of the process and the file will not close  before this institution have the security that they fulfil  the principles of transparency and of equality of deal.
Maybe His *Señoría wanted to pose this question to the diverse States members, boost the participation in the inferior grades of the category "To" to watch by that, with the step of the years, there #be more available women to end to assume places of direction.
#If *usted pretends to fund *Kosovo, #if it wants to respect the commitments *algo precipitated that the President of the Commission has purchased regarding this region, as well, *dénos the budgetary means to be serious and coherent and *dénos the possibility to review the financial perspectives.
The career by the world-wide prices and the heaves of the performances have put in danger it more esteemed that have: the quality of our feeding and the survival of our employments in the rural zones.
It had not been much simpler to accept before these appeals of the Parliament and have averted #all these precipitations of last hour, that do not benefit for nothing the image of seriousness and efficiency that supposes  in the #european institutions?
It is not very healthy, as neither it is it the fact to devote the 50 % of our debates from this afternoon to talk of a province of the #serbian State that is not member of the European Union.
The nurses and the doctors of the #french hospitals, that are the summit of the competition, are today in strike because the budgetary austerity comes to *recortar the hospitable costs and the sanitary costs.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To5-0090/1999) of the Mrs. *Theato, in name of the Commission of Control Budgetary, on the nomination of eight members of the Court of Accounts (*C5-0231/1999, *C5-0232/1999, *C5-0233/1999, *C5-0234/1999, *C5-0235/1999, *C5-0236/1999, *C5-0237/1999, *C5-0238/1999 - 1999/0820(*CNS)).
I regret that the #finnish Presidency of the Council withdraw  now, since the Finns also aspire to the nomination for a new mandate of his already accredited member of the Court of Accounts.
The crisis of the Commission that finish to leave backwards has left *sobradamente patent, in effect, *cuán necessary is to have of an effective mechanism to demand responsibilities to the civil servants of the EU that commit grave errors of management or even lacking graver.
Consistently, the editorial of the proposal of regulation by part of the Commission and of the Council has taken in getting, and even so it has been judged of little concrete and of incomplete, since it do not includes the procedures of execution.
#This will contribute decisively to improve the competitiveness of our car industry in a world-wide plane, at the same time that will ensure a greater security and the respect to the requirements of the environment, for benefit of the consumers.
Gentleman President, wanted to signal that the measures of security deployed this week with reason of the visit of the #french President have been really exemplary. *Nos Congratulate that the order and the security have been present in #all moment.
This Green Book *nos will offer the opportunity to celebrate a wide debate among #all the interested on the approach that have to adopt for *abaratar even more the costs for our economies of the reduction of the gases of effect *invernadero.
I think that this environmental problem is of #such magnitude that is able to interest to the majority of the citizens and to the public opinion, since it exists a true restlessness by the climatic change that is producing .
Without being against of the principle of a *imposición on the broadcasts *contaminantes, create, nevertheless, that these measures have to respect two principles: by a part, encourage for guaranteeing the fiscal neutrality and, on the other hand, involve to the group of the world industrialised or, at least, to the *OCDE, not to create distortions of competition or of *dumping ecological.
The publication of the Green Book on sustainable energy in *Irlanda has to be seen like a positive contribution of the sector of the energy to the debate on possible solutions to the threat of the climatic change
But this need, as it expresses it the conjoint resolution presented, do not means that the European Union  *desinterese of the future of a so linked territory to our history and even our culture.
This general attention of *Europa is the best practical guarantee supplementary that we #can give, the best form that have, on our part, to ensure that *Macao will see protected his specificity, that we follow treating to *Macao of a specific mood, without *diluirla in a general magma.
Also we #can accept in principle the amendment 26, on condition that the text specify that the reports will have to send to the Commission before 31 March of every year, and the amendment 27, on condition that  *le add a reference to the Scientific Committee of Evaluation of compliance with the Protocol of *Montreal.
. (*FR) With occasion of the debates that preceded to the meeting of *Seattle, #many had thought, in this Assembly, that *Europa had to begin for asking a balance of the previous cycles and that had to effect  a diagnostic together with the countries in roads of development, before launching  to a new cycle of liberalisation.
*Seattle Is a failure for #that that wished to continue blindly the career to the generalisation of the *librecambio and the *mercantilización of the world and is a victory of the citizen movement in his diversity, of #the same type that the that had conducted to the rejection of the *AMI.
The *Cnuced is the frame with greater legitimacy to treat the question of the foreign direct investments, inside the respect of the democratic right of the States to legislate in environmental and social matter.
We proposed even a moratorium for the start of the negotiations, with seen to allow the realisation of said balance and to concretise a back reflection on the roads that follow the international commercial relations.
As it also results unavoidable, finally, outline a new commercial order -in the frame of a *mundialización based in the progress and in the solidarity- that respect the fundamental political rights, of the social progress and of the environment.
It is not, as, surprising that, as it signals the resolution that proposes , the States members of the European Union have not taken the necessary measures to respect his commitments of *Kioto, *cuando, to #the same time, in *Europa is carrying out #one *desreglamentación systematic.
. (*FR) Wish to congratulate to the members of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer, and in particular to his presidency by this proposal of resolution relative to the labeling of products that contain *OMG.
Regarding the labeling of foods produced from *OMG, the Council has adopted the Regulation 1139/98/*CE applicable to the foods and alimentary ingredients allocated to the final consumer total or partially obtained from: beans of soya modified genetically, to that refers  the Decision 96/281/*CE; corn modified genetically, to that refers  the Decision 97/28/*CE.
Also in this case, our colleague vice-president has been missing, in my opinion, to the norms of his function, so much for *conmigo as it bear with the colleague that had taken part before and bear with other colleagues that wished to take part, specifically the Mrs. *Muscardini, to the one who *denegó the word and loomed even with *expulsarla.
Like deputies are the direct democratic link with the population of the European Union, and the Commission of Rights of the Woman is a direct link with #a lot of organisations and representations of women.
I expect thus that the Commission today #can *asegurarme that the reproductive health will have a paper stood out in the community conference and that the European Parliament of #one or another form #can take part in New *York #such as *sucedió with the agreement with reason of the negotiations of the *OMC, #where himself/hisself that were represented.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the statement of the Commission on the course that has to give to the decision of the #french Government to keep the embargo on the meat of *vacuno #british.

In *tercer place, here do not treats  simply, #if well it is #that the point of game, of the question of the trade *transfronterizo among *Austria and *Alemania, but of the question of the paper that exert the linguistic spaces, the cultural fields.
*Nosotros The Austrians have clear that the alone possibility to dictate rule of national field is not sufficient, but that require  a relative clause to the import and #another to the export, of compliance with the #french model, as linguistic and cultural space mean more.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the central question is #if the embargo of armament in the frame of the measures of restrictions adopted against Indonesian, that was agreed by the Council in September of this year, has to extend further of the month of January of the year that comes.
In spite of our past failure in guaranteeing that it #would not murder  to the persons, have again the obligation to guarantee that in the future do not send  any message of support to the current authorities.
Had clear that it #would be a very difficult task. Had clear that they have to create basically #ex *novo #all the conditions for the constitution of a State of Right effective and stable in #Sierra Lion and that the disposal to collaborate is limited.
This type of dictatorship, this type of terrorism against the population and the bad employment of the resources in an unnecessary cost in armament for a country of this size, is *injustificable.
I am absolutely #willing, lady *Thors, to explain to the candidates to the adhesion the need to sign and ratify this agreement. Nevertheless, I believe that the gentleman *Posselt has affirmed with tarpaulin to this *respecto that my position in this subject will enjoy of credibility *cuando the Fifteen have ratified it.
Also we know to appreciate the important contribution that in this field have loaned the no governmental organisations that devote his efforts to the sensitisation of the States in favour of the statute of Blunt and his prompt ratification.
The sensitivities of *Irlanda of the North are too much important as to allow any bad attempt informed to come close  to the sun that more heats in the subject of the International Bottom for *Irlanda.
, by writing. (IN) The European Parliament facilitated the vote without debate on the Bottom, that afterwards was postponed by the Council, with the agreement of #all the Groups, included the Greens, that there #would be any amendment.
Any attempt of *mancillar the reputation of this Bottom is absolutely unacceptable, do not represents more that a case of *borreguismo bad politician informed in the subject of the sensitivities of *Irlanda of the North, and is not #worthy of this Parliament.
Never I have comprised why the Commission has not accepted that from 1 January next, these two data, already compulsory the community frame, use  to allow an operative principle of *rastreabilidad.

#If *Tayikistán is today delivered to the economic difficulties that enumerates the report, as *tantos other countries of the world on the other hand, is because certainly it is victim of an opening *desconsiderada of the borders and of the immoderate game of the empires.
Distinguished gentleman President, in spite of great objections, have voted in favour of the financial help, because I see a possibility to establish the economy of market democracy and the peace by means of financial stimuluses, as it has exposed the Mr. *Karas, and no through the violence.
Subject: Application of the program *Philoxenia The European Parliament, the Commission and the Economic and Social Committee have issued already his *dictamen positive on the instauration of a program *plurianual in favour of the #european tourism designated *Philoxenia.
Likewise, in the Statement *nº 30 *aneja to the Treaty of *Amsterdam recognises  that the insular regions suffer of structural disadvantages linked to his specific insular character, and asks  that the Union take into account said disadvantages and that, always that it was necessary, take  specific measures with regard to integrating better said regions in the inner market in conditions *equitativas.
Without embargo, *le want to indicate that a territory with an inferior level to the 75 % of the level of welfare half in *Europa is a territory of help even according to the Goal *I of the structural Bottoms.
To the sight of the importance of the events and of the possibility that it aggravate  the unsteadiness in the region, has foreseen the Council *redoblar his diplomatic efforts to reach an agreement in *Jammu and Cashmere?
The European Council underlined especially that it has to deepen the economic coordination to ensure the hit of the Economic and Monetary Union and support a growth that *repercuta effectively on the employment of a mood sustained.
Gentleman President, are in front of a work taken with big rigour, with brilliance, with an enormous clarity and with #a lot of courage: a report of the Mr. *Herman that answers to the goals that has proposed  to improve the operation of the institutions.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, after the debate of this afternoon on the conflict in Serbian and the expulsions in *Kosovo, sees  even more clearly reason the enlargement of the Union in countries of the *Europa central and oriental, beside #everything it other, is the most important instrument for the *aseguramiento of the peace and goes to follow being it also in the future.
#If they watch  the economic data and believe  the prognoses, *Polonia is #one of the strongest economies among the countries of the *Europa central, with taxes of upper growth to the 5 %, an unemployment and tax of inferior inflation to the 10 % and a growth of the income of the 4, 5 %.
From then there #be had a change of government in 1996 and took  the decision to leave in suspense the appeal and to occupy  in his place of *concertar an agreement of association reinforced.
In the last enlargement ran a risk when admitting to three new members before having made the necessary institutional reforms for *ocuparnos of the consequences of the increase of the number of members.
This risk aggravated  because of the presence in two of these countries of minorities *anticomunitarias very important that, #if they were majorities, #can, owing to it unsuitable of our current institutional arrangements, have cancelled #all the work made by the Communities.
Some lower advances obtained  in the plane of the adaptation to the *acervo, especially in the field of the environment, and requires  an acceleration of the legislative work, #as well as of the efforts to attract investments in said sector of the environment.
Regarding the program of restructuring of the industry *siderúrgica #can *elogiar to *Polonia by the enormous quantity of work invested, #if well they will have to increase the efforts for clearing even more #all the strategy of privatisation of the two greater companies and introduce a clear calendar for the privatisation and restructuring.
In relation to the request of the Mr. *Bertens about the presentation of a proposal for a financial mechanism, repeat it that already have said before regarding Malt, that are working in the replacement of the financial protocol.
I am here. I do not take part in the nominal votes in protest by the no adoption by part of the *cuestores of an appealable decision in front of *Luxemburgo, that requested by writing already in August of the past year, in relation with the illicit retention effected by the Mr. *Chamier on my compensations of costs.
#If the public civil servants #can not talk neither write about his daily work without the consent of his upper, #can not expect that there #be an atmosphere motivated and fine in the place of work.
It is necessary to demand that have an independent budget that #can use of reasonable form, that have sufficient personnel, it same the Commission of Requests that the Defender of the Village, that are two institutions that really preserve the rights of the #european citizenship.
It wanted to appreciate and congratulate to the speakers, to the Mrs. Of #Esteban #Martín and to the Mr. *Newman, by his reports that, as always *sucede in this commission, are the final product of the collective work and of the contribution of #all his members.
The Mr. *Newman has been a true «dog of #british prey» in this parliamentary commission, and never has left to happen the occasion to take part in name of the citizens of the Community.
Regarding the institution of the Defender of the Village, is evident that exerts an increasingly important function and a truly positive paper for the group of the community system.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Defender of the Village, *Señorías, in virtue of the Treaty of the European Union is the Parliament, and no the Commission, the addressee of the annual report of the Defender of the Village.
The Parliament has exerted an important function also in another field: *me refer to the code of behaviour for the correct behaviour of the administration in his relations with the citizens.
The foundation of the amendment 8 #can not admit in the measure in that the committee in question fulfil #the same functions of the Committee of politics *aduanera. I will go back on this point inside some moments.
In addition to *ello, in my report consider the possibility to complement the system of *tarificación based in the social costs *marginales with measures in the field of the taxes related with the transport. More in concrete, propose that said taxes coordinate  to scale #european and that, in his case, reduce .
Apart from *ello, is fundamental that launch  informative campaigns in the that the system of transport proposed promote  in front of the population like a respectful sustainable system with the environment, leaving clear that do not treats  to happen once again invoices to the motorist without justification #any.
By a part, do not loans the owed attention to the costs of construction, capital and maintenance and, on the other hand, includes without differentiation #any the *imputación of the called external costs. Among these costs appear #among others the damages *ocasionados to the environment, the saturation of the traffic and the accidents.
For me the solution is simple. Of the studies gives off that in the actuality the motorist deprived already pays the costs of the infrastructure of the transport that  *le want to impute in concept of general taxes, imposed on the fuel and taxes on the vehicles.
Of course, we #can think that #this is an imperfect system, but -is a fact- has imposed  in the history like the only able to avert a chaos and a still greater absolutism that the that they are imputable to #one or another sovereignty in particular.
By have not known to create the permanent forum of the big *Europa, formed by some open cooperations from the *primer moment to the SIN, on questions so vital like the security and the external politics, our continent goes back to divide .
It results obviously legitimate to aspire to achieve a harmonisation of the distinct disposals in the sector of the transports, especially #if of this way guarantees  a more flowed operation of the inner market.
As definitely they know his *Señorías, the States members #can authorise a maximum weight of 44 tonnes for the vehicles of engine of three axes that form part of a vehicle combined of five or six axes to end to avert that similar vehicles deteriorate too much the roads.
The report that today presents  is #one of these reports of the that the members of the Commission of Rights of the Woman seat  proud, because sure enough it bases  in a wide consensus and in the collaboration of #all his members.
Although in the field of this juridical foundation that, go back to repeat, *nos seems rigid and too much *restrictivo, the violence is first of all, and reiterate it vigorously, a rape of the human rights, reason by the *cual the action against the violence have to execute from an approach *multidisciplinario.
Nobody *nos has said #if it is truth that the truck that went in by the #french mouth already was in flames to the entrance of the tunnel, and *nos entertain in reckoning a small difference of minutes, #one or two, among the #french intervention and the Italian.
It was the days 6 and 7 April *cuando perished 25 civil victims of the militia armed that answers to the name of «*Meraputi» with the active collusion of the mobile brigade of the unit of politics of *elite of Indonesian.
Gentleman President, *le ask that it send a note of protest to the Dr. *Mahathir about the deficient political trial that it has been object *Anwar #Ibrahim, a note of protest in accordance with the numerous resolutions of criticism that has approved this Parliament in relation with *Malasia.
The creation of a court *ad *hoc is desirable, without embargo, never will rid  of the suspicion that it treats  of a special court that already has anticipated, by like this say it, his sentence and that has not offered to the imputed the guarantees that, even an imputed like *Ta *Mok, deserves.
The Mr. *Port, that has to his charge the investigation, has received a total and boundless mandate and the freedom to add resources or to use resources for other ends, as it wish it.
Also we owe *preocuparnos by the possible consequences *nefastas of the fact that the Commission resort of form generalised to the services of some pertinent temporary personnel of the national public administrations or of the industry.
It That, in general, deduces  of the report of the Defender of the #european Village is that the confidence of the #european citizens bases  in the transparency, in the dialogue, in clear juridical norms that *les allow to defend his rights.
Gentleman President, the idea to approve a program allocated to warn the violence exerted against the boys, the teenagers and the women is a generous and noble idea that #all, of course, #can subscribe.
Nevertheless, also I have left clear that *nos concerns especially the modification of the juridical base. I said then that *eso *nos #would water considerably the party and has blurred *algo our happiness, since the violence against boys and women, gentleman Commissioner, is not, of course, only a risk for the health.
I have received, in the day of yesterday, a motion of censorship against the Commission, the whole of #whose members resigned of his charges of form collective on 16 May 1999.
The purpose of the motion of censorship, in the parliamentary Right, is to check that an Executive has lost the confidence of the majority of the Assembly or, in case of rejection, that keeps this confidence.
The public information on the criminal nature of #such acts and the weight of the penal performance have to substitute to the silence and to the *mansedumbre that still *les accompany with *demasiada frequency in our nevertheless developed societies.
We are desirous to see how resulted will give the guidelines on the employment that the Commission agreed in the conference of *Luxemburgo and #some of the debates on the Social Bottom European and the workers of age advanced.
Our speakers, the Gentlemen *McMahon and *Schiedermeier have carried out an excellent work no only in the preparation of his report, but also to the hour to prepare the conference of the third age in #whose conclusions bases  amply said document.
To illustrate my words, stand out the fact that the index of *autoabastecimiento of the American market has happened of the level #zero to roughly the 165 %, whereas the *autoabastecimiento of the #european market of *lisina happened of the 84 % in 1991 to the 54 % in 1997, and his tendency is to the 38 % in the 2002 #if they do not produce  changes.
As it is #likely that the corn using for the production of the industry of the starch follow  selling in States Joined to an inferior price to the of the community cereals, seems logical no only keep the current device of compensation of the American damage, but reinforce it considerably.
As it knows His *Señoría, for being #one of the authors of the new Regulation, the section 3 of the article 9 has that the relative questions to the rights and privileges of the ancient deputies require a decision of the Table.
Gentleman President, finish to know that the Council of Ministers has taken the decision to incorporate to the #european administration to the employees of the group of *Schengen that work for the Council.
In relation with the monetary politics, insist in the need of independence of the #ECB, so that it #can fulfil of the best possible way his committed in matter of stability of prices, and ensure the favourable conditions for the growth and the employment.
It is necessary to congratulate then, that in #day of elections, so much the Parliament like the Commission have been able to face up to the requirements of the economy and resist of form relatively *honrosa the pressures of the public opinion, of the media and of some groups of pressure.
Lady Speaker, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, *cuando listens  to the Mrs. Go *Lancker, that do not wants to have any book of recipes *neoliberal, #can not less that say that *nosotros neither want to take of the economic political-orientations any book of tales socialist.
It pretends  with #this guarantee that the great orientations are a test of big *envergadura to put of self-evident the will of the States members to coordinate in the practice, Mrs. *Lienemann, the economic politics using the instruments created to this end.
Finally, Mr. *Blot, *usted manifests a fear that *me allow the luxury of not sharing. *Usted Fears that the coordination of the fiscal systems, after the monetary union, delete also #one of the two residual possibilities of strategy against the famous asymmetric crashes.
On this subject the Commission of Control Budgetary has accepted today, before the start of this debate, a report that will be smart to be voted next Thursday together with the report on the regulation.
It is to expect that the next electoral contention treat also other important political subjects, without embargo, is now *cuando has to rid the battle of the great reforms while still there #be the political will for *ello.
In this moment results that the fraud and the theft are a form of life, an engineering, and now the delinquency organised is an elegant delinquency, that proceeds of the best means, that studies, that works to steal.
But act with independence, is or is not an utopia *cuando #a lot of States members have judicial systems in full crisis, *cuando many times the own judicial system, influenced by the executive power -because every time it respects  less the separation of powers of *Montesquieu- leaves to prescribe cases absolutely flagrant of fraud in the that are thousands of millions in game?
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen colleagues, under my Presidency the Council of Ministers of Economy and Finances adopted on 15 March 1999 a clear position: any understanding, swims of tolerance for the fraud and the corruption in the Community.
On the observation formulated by the Mr. *Brinkhorst concerning the question of the agencies decentralised -to the that also has referred  the Mr. *Kellett-*Bowman-, is essential that the Council tackle this question, on the that the Parliament and the Commission agree.
We expect that the new Commission was able to learn the lesson of the events that have lived so that it manage well his mandate and that the failure of today clear the path to the hit of the morning.
It takes more of a year, on 31 March 1998, the European Parliament decided to elaborate a report on the granting of the approval of the management to the Commission for the exercise of 1996.
It do not approves  the management for 1996, his accounts close , and only will be able to  concede the approval for 1997 -and #this finishes it to say *usted, gentleman *Bösch, with #all reason- *cuando have corrected  the deficiencies. We have criticised it *nosotros and finish it to criticise also *ustedes.
By this reason, neither #can  close, without more, the accounts of the budgetary exercise of 1996 while, for example, have not formulated  the claim in the case of nepotism that have ascertained .
It is true that the coincidence of this entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with the last session *plenaria of the present Parliament do not facilitates the things, but are convinced that the loyal cooperation among the institutions will allow to resolve the possible problems.
In our global assessment, #if we had followed this road of not foreseeing the unanimity, #would have had difficulties of principle a lot greater that the that will have to the hour to take happen the proposal in the Council.
Roman *Prodi exposed to the Bosses of State and of Government his first reflections to the *respecto in his informal meeting of 14 April in *Bruselas. It is foreseen that this exchange of opinions continue in the European Council of Colony of the 3 and 4 July.
The fact that we are here debating the ratification of a new President of the Commission, six months before *cuando corresponded according to the calendar is a reflection of the change of functions and perspectives of the European Union.
#This is #one *constatación important, gentleman President of the Commission: in *Europa, in the countries and #european regions #where do not exists the incarnation of the European Union, #where the European Union is not *solidaria, follows existing the possibility of war.
*Deseándole, nevertheless, that carry out a good work, expect that *usted #can resolve the challenges of the construction of *Europa having very present the problems of the environment, of the health and of the peace that are integral part of the rights of citizenship.
I agree, gentleman *Prodi, in the need to strengthen the paper of the Commission in matter of the cooperation inside the *OMC, without embargo, want to alert against the risk that for achieving #this throw by the embroiders the social dimension and take like hostages to the consumers and the environment.
I go to repeat it again clearly and in no uncertain terms: we have to strengthen the strengths of the market, but also have to have clear that, in our model, the market only #can work #if they reduce  to the minimum the unemployment and the social fractures in our society.
In consequence, only want *decirles that *me seat responsible of the great tasks assigned to the Commission that have signalled. I share fully his wish that the Commission go back, better said, assume definitively the paper that the Treaties *le attribute -the paper of initiative and of political proposal- and that exert it with big transparency.
I believe that the disposals approved have a circumstantial character, relative to find a solution to the problem of the exercise 1996, and never is well modify the general texts to solve a problem in particular.
The Group *Europa of the Nations has affirmed in reiterated occasions the conviction that it exists a direct relation among the reduction of the type of the VAT and the improvement of the employment.
We have voted sure enough in favour of this report, in particular, by his section 1 -#can remain, gentleman *Dell'#Alba, remain some instants-, in particular, as it said, because of his section 1, with regard to the that, sure enough, do not argue that it do not adjust  faithfully to the reality, but that, in our opinion, has a political meaning very clear.
Likewise, this day, took #ours and attach to our report the reasons of the decision of 17 December 1998, reasons that condemned to the Commission and #would have to have conducted, from this stage, as *nosotros proposed, to a censorship by part of the parliamentary majority.
*Yo Wanted to highlight it once again with #all firmness and *me *congratulo that finally no only have achieved  a hardening of the sanctions of the EU against *Yugoslavia, but also the ratification of the embargo of the EU against the oil.
*Nosotros Also are adherents that it take  all it possible in the region, but it true is that they exist pressures and, therefore, *yo urge to the President of the Council to that it watch, together with the Minister of Subjects Inner German, to achieve a greater cast and a cast more *equitativo of the charges.
Gentleman President, in view of the last speech, costs the pity remember to this Assembly that ten years ago that practises  the ethnic purification in *Kosovo and that the refugees were seeing  expelled of his homes a lot before the NATO initiated the bombardments.
It needs a new fact because the bombardments no longer have effect: or they continue  bombing the things that already have been bombed until this moment or bomb  the cities. The path of the war is forbidden, do not exists.
I think that it has been a sample of inability of the Council have not been able to adopt #such decision, and think that in some sense has been to deny to accept the consequences of our acts.
The previous requirement is, without embargo, in the first place, that *Belgrado do not have any doubt on the determination of the international community and, second, that comprise that a military solution do not offers any perspective for Serbian neither neither, very personally, for the Mr. *Milosevic.
Prepare it *apresuradamente without the help of the High Representative and without the reality neither the structure of queries with the Parliament is, to my trial, a sample of pride immoderate.
The current war in *Kosovo has shown once again that the capacity of intervention military of the EU in case of crisis, that so much has defended  in this House, is a peremptory need.
The international community has launched by the embroiders this principle of peace to the sight of the massive attempts against the human rights and the ethnic deportations committed in *Kosovo.
Even the research of solution political tried by *Kofi *Annan in his meeting with the President *Yeltsin is condemned by those who fear that #if the logic finishes imposing, in front of the *despropósito and the absurd that  *retroalimentan, will result damaged the military prestige of the NATO and will remain ridiculed the politics of #Clinton bear *Kosovo.
It is necessary to split of the northern dimension in the external relations to the hour to create a common specific strategy in the that the relations with *Rusia exert a fundamental function.
Also it is necessary to take into account that we have to give the step to a politics of defence (in this sense am clearly adherent of the integration of the *UEO in the European Union) to be able to answer like this to the challenges to the that *nos confront in this moment.
To #all which adds , besides, another fact: how *les are asking, in fact, to the colleagues? They pretend that they vote his project, that purportedly has to resolve existential problems, without having had opportunity to examine it in commission, without that the political Groups have had at least the opportunity to examine it.
Gentleman President, the report of our colleague *Rothley shows aptly a series of lacks, insufficiencies and even errors of the project of statute for the deputies to the European Parliament that *nos has presented the Council.
I add, nevertheless, that am totally against of *europeizar our function, because in this hemicycle represent to *Flandes and no to a species of *Eurosuperestado, because I am totally contrary to the fiscal advantages that comports the #european statute and because I follow being adherent of a national fiscal statute that *nos grave exactly it same that to our voters.
I #can not accept on no account the point of game of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens since it do not involves another thing that the postponement without date of this question.
Ladies and gentlemen, first wanted to *transmitirles an information: in the votes of this afternoon, the Parliament has confirmed his opinions about the proposals of the Commission in the that modifies  the procedure, owing to the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
*Eso Is a step of giant and have said to the principle of the debate: I #can not avert the impression, since we were in a deadlock, that always in the year, in the that change of Parliament *nos *sobreviene a wave of promotions.
By the moment, the *APG do not endows the initiative *URBAN of the Community, but the decisions in this matter will incorporate  in the proposal of budget in a back stage of the procedure.
Therefore, it wanted to *concentrarme in the substance of this subject, that is, #such as they have affirmed it the Mr. *Sindal and the Mr. *Swoboda, a subject of essential importance, in it that my *respecta, and in the measure in that it affects to the politics of the development of the public transport.
Through Internet the provider #can offer to the customers his services without additional costs happening by #all the borders, and the consumer, without having to displace, #can compare the services among the different providers of his own country and of other countries.
This right #can exert only in two cases: #if the agreement signed  before the consumer had of the contractual conditions and #if  *le has incited of disloyal way to celebrate the agreement during the term of reflection.
Regarding the #another amendment, that is the famous 22 to the article 4 on the right of retractation, *me add to the enlargement of the term of thirty days for some agreements. I put for example the that in said amendment mention  -that *yo #would call of high risk-, as it is the of the insurance *vitalicio or the of the pensions of retirement.
It is true that, increasingly -and #would have to be even more frequent and the data that has given the Mr. *Whitehead are interesting-, #would have to use the open field by Internet for the contractings, even of the financial services, sector on the that the consumers show  more reluctant in the actuality; and it is true, gentleman *Whitehead, that *never, *never, *never, *at *the *expense *of *the *consumer .
It Last is only a recommendation, more did not want the Parliament by #a lot of that *yo regret it, but with the time perhaps #a lot of producers perceive #this like a possibility to obtain better opportunities of commercialisation of his products in #all the parts of the inner market.
#If the solution #can not be the repair or the change, the buyer has still the right to a suitable reduction of the price or to the cancellation of the agreement.
The only object of the proposal is to ensure that in any place that the consumers take his shopping in the European Union, enjoy of a minimum level of guarantees and #can appeal in resource in his country of origin.
In front of the insistence of this Assembly, the free repairs or the replacement also will include the costs of sending, the hand of drama and the materials.
With the difficulties that the population has to take out his agricultural products of there and the difficulties that had the euro-deputies to get to these populations, no *me explain, *cuando there #be a catastrophe, how is possible that #can *afrontarla without sufficient means.
Gentleman President, to be brief, because of the big volume of subjects that have to debate in the Plenary this afternoon and had account of the late hour, propose *limitarme to some #few pertinent observations on my report, that has been elaborated in name of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer.
I want to express another time with clarity, that in the Parliament *nos have based always in the affirmations of scientists, as for example the affirmations of the *ESPEGAM, that has defended the clear position that while it did not have  *ADI for babies, has to apply  a strict value of *cuasi zero.
*Le Say sincerely, and *eso knows it of the previous debates: it had preferred that it had renounced  to the directive on foods for sportsmen, since #this *nos carries to #one *desinformación, since it will be very difficult to reach clear disposals for the different sports, since the feeding differs a lot according to the type of sport and will be difficult to propose determined foods for determined sports.
I do not want *referirme to *ellos, but yes wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to indicate it following: by #a lot of that *nos have taken to advance *Amsterdam in the practical parliamentarism, do not have to overlook that *nos is missing still enough to reach a real parliamentarism in the European Union.
The hit of the procedure of *codecisión, in the first years of his operation, went definitely, for the last Conference *Intergubernamental, a clear signal to expand his field to almost #all the main legislative activities.
The decision did not have at all that see with the fact that they went pictures of a homosexual or no -question that do not know-, but simply with the fact that the content of the exhibition considered  offensive for a part of the Assembly and of the persons that *transitan by *ella.
*Quinto: The preparation of our institution for the next #european elections; some elections in the that do not chooses  to the *pariente poor of the community institutions, but to a Parliament that the citizens see for the first time endowed of big can and able to exert it.
There #be not alive democracy #where there #be not an alive parliament, neither alive parliament that do not arouse the distrust and the discomfort of the executive of turn.
On the one hand, because it exists the need of more *Europa, exists the need of a greater paper of *Europa in the world and the historical context-politician *nos shows it, and #if they will not exist institutions renewed and a strong political will, this need of *Europa will not be able to  fulfil specifically.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen Presidents, estimated colleagues, in this Assembly have seen that the operation of the Presidencies is not a question that depend so much of the corresponding country or of the aptitudes of his leaders but of the dynamics of the Union.
I believe that this Parliament, in the resolution of November to the that has alluded the president Of #Giovanni, proposed *algo original, and is *algo so original like simple: resort to the community method, to the method to the that are *habituados, to prepare the institutional reform.
Now it is the moment to give body to the identity of the #european defence, at least #if the European Council comprise it that there #be in game and converts the Summit of Colony in a hit.
For example, the Federal Republic of *Alemania already has presented his plan and is working in his realisation, has put to disposal two one thousand millions of frames for a special program for the creation of 100.000 places of work and of training for youngsters stopped.
The Parliament has been informed to regulate and totally on the progress of the works with the Diary 2000 and the suggestions of the Parliament has been included in the considerations of the Commission and of the Council.
Without embargo, go to call the attention on the last example of disposal to the commitment of the Council in front of the Parliament, to know, the *prosecución of the community initiative *URBAN, that has reached  to instances of the European Parliament.
In this way, no only it strengthens  the sustainable development of the rural areas but that besides takes  possible the *codecisión of the European Parliament in agricultural questions, as these costs go  to reflect in the future like costs no compulsory.
The citizens of *Europa (the of the fifteen countries members and the of the countries candidates to the adhesion, the of *Europa oriental and the of *Chipre) expect and demand that the European Union was a real Union, political and social, with prestige and strength, and that like this #can exert a leading paper worldwide in front of the year 2000.
The answer of the majority of this Assembly in the day of today is not to the height of his commitments regarding his own constituents neither of the expectations of the public opinion.
We have voted in favour of the amendment presented by the Liberal Group about the question of the wages and the compensations of the Parliament because it is the only possibility to reach a reform so *trabajosa and demanded as it is #this.
I expect with interest assist to the evolution of this subject, but #can not give my support to the directive in his current state and thus *me have abstained in the final vote in that it has approved  the text.
By the contrary, the proposal has to build on the base of rules minimum, that make possible to the countries members the maintenance of his more strict norms and *les give freedom for *hacerlas even more rigorous #if like this they wish it.
In my country *nos ensured #one and another time that the European Union #would not be *militarizada, and without embargo, are #many the reports that have happened by this Parliament during the five years that have been here that indicate clearly that the EU advances in this direction.
Like proof, an emblematic passage: «the examination of the common strategy regarding *Rusia inscribes  in a political context that has modified  with the intervention armed of the NATO against the Yugoslav Federation.
The big majority of my political group goes to give his affirmative vote to the Agreement *Interinstitucional on the financial planning to half term and, of course, go to give it also to the parts of the Diary 2000 that require of our assent.
I expect that the commitment of the Mr. Go give *Broek to examine the possibility that there #be a special line in the budget for the finance of *Chipre take  reality, because we #can not have two weights and two measures.
The conclusion that extract to the *respecto is that #if it do not reaches  definitively plant the #european interest above the national interests, will not reach to get to a politics of cohesion economic and social really advanced.
This informal procedure is a continuous exchange of information, a fruitful dialogue that has taken possible the inclusion of the priorities of the Parliament in the definite text of *Berlín, although they remain #some requirements that will be negotiated in back meetings to *Berlín.
Likewise, the Parliament receives with big satisfaction the approval of the appeal that the Union assume an active paper in the promotion of a durable peace and of the prosperity in *Irlanda of the North.
The first priority was to guarantee the continuation of the Bottom, and the Council reached to approve the opinion of the Parliament that the basic goals of the Bottom of Cohesion follow being today so important as in 1992.
These projects will mark a real and tangible difference in the lives of millions of our citizens that live in the most remote regions and less developed of the Community.
A *desliz of the Parliament, or simply a no responsible exercise of our competitions, #can *llevarnos to approve #some amendments that prevented to close tomorrow this important regulation and that the #european regions #can not, in consequence, program his performances for the first of January of the year 2000.
Although it do not exist any determination *porcentual for the assignment of credits, *nos have put of agreement on a strengthening of the positive politics of labour market and of the specific helps for the women.
Thus, it is even more important that -and east is also a hit of the Parliament- have of some generous transitory regulations that guarantee that they do not produce  some painful and *contraproducentes interruptions of the helps and that the regions #be six years old of time to adapt  to the changes.
To reach it intensify our contacts with the Commission and the Council, multiply our dialogues *tripartitos, and even celebrate an informal seminar with the Presidency and the Commission in *Viena to treat of the flexibility.
The Commission of Budgets has supported the proposal to include capital deprived in the finance of the projects of the networks and has posed the possibility to increase said participation of the 1 % until the 2 %.
Increasing the possibilities of the persons to keep his place of work, to achieve a place of work or another better is *algo that we #can take with help of the Social Bottom European.
The Presidency goes to restart the subject after consulting with the partners, especially with *Finlandia, in the frame of the second Committee of Cooperation EU-*Ucrania that will celebrate  in July and will include it among the official subjects of the conversations among the EU and *Ucrania.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, with #the same constructive spirit that, glimpse, *subyace in his answer, #can *concretarme exactly how will take the European Union to contribute to the cessation of the violence and how measured will adopt also to contribute to that combat  the corruption in *Argelia?
Without embargo, do not treats  of an isolated fact but of an assessment of character general that the #swedish tongue seldom uses  *cuando the #swedish representatives negotiate in the Council.
Subject: Member of the Commission, competent for the equality of opportunities among men and women In accordance with the articles 2, 3, 137.1 and 141 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the equality of opportunities among men and women has to be #one of the greater worries of the European Union.
Also I have thought to ask #if it has argued  how it goes  to take to boost actively the equality of opportunities among men and women after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, *cuando #all the groups, also the women, want to use the article 13 on discrimination.
After the shy proposal of the Commission, the agreements of *Berlín have supposed a course backwards in the limitation of the helps to the great exploitations and the increase of the support to the small and average.
It is of receipt, in a moment in the that #all legitimately sue more *Europa in the employment and in general in the structural reform, in the process of enlargement of the EU, in the help *solidaria by #one *Europa greater, celebrate like a hit of *Berlín that #all want to that in the future *Europa *nos cost less?
The truth is that the budget do not goes to give for this «rural development», that #would be, in fact, the form to balance the most disadvantaged regions in relation with the most favoured.
Some final words on the Common Agricultural Politics and the resultant reform of *Berlín, is to say, the absence of reform: *Berlín no *reequilibró neither promoted, in fact, an investment of the existent discriminations among productions and agriculturalists.
And it is truth that regarding the Diary 2000 pose  important *interrogantes: the #european agricultural strategy, our alimentary future, the structural politics, the finance of *Europa, by not mentioning the opening to the East.
Also it is undoubted that the fact of *dedicarnos to introduce zones of free change in the international market represents a danger -for example, the Mr. #Martin mentioned it takes a moment regarding the *viticultores, alluding to the case of *Suecia and *Irlanda, that have converted  in viticultural zones, it that *les allows to obtain musts concentrated for perhaps manufacture industrial wines.
*Loyola Of Palace has hidden that the 550.000 tonnes of increase of the quota *lechera do not have right to premium and, in the *vacuno, the increases will not compensate the reduction *pactada of the 20 % of the prices, producing a reduction of the incomes in this sector of some 30.000 millions of pesetas.
The fact that the negotiations have translated  in results in a moment that coincides with the resignation of the Commission constitutes a sample more of the capacity of performance of the European Union.
Gentleman President, go to use ten seconds of my lovely time to congratulate to the Commissioners and to the here present President, especially by the stoicism to be here with *nosotros to this hour of the night.
In this renunciation have influenced convincingly the pressures exerted by the Commission of Fishing of the Parliament, #whose unanimous posture has exerted a paper swims *desdeñable to the hour to revoke  this decision.
Always it has been a grave and serious problem that the European Parliament has watched often with distrust, also because no always resulted clear #who was the manager and of how way was possible any control and information by part of the European Parliament.
It means that the paper of the Commission remains *inalterado, but also takes  *algo easier, because the Commission no longer sees  situated in front of a uniform front of States members that say: Yes; only we want to go back exactly to *aquello that already had agreed in our common position.
It wanted to *agradecerles to #all his cooperation with our Group, #as well as to the Parliament and to the Mr. *Hughes, the one who has been an excellent president in #everything it relative to this question, very *perseverante, like the skaters that begin the career with a bit of slowness but that, to base of continuity, reaches an excellent result when getting to the dip.
Himself/Hisself It wanted to, gentleman President, take advantage of this debate to say two things that *me seem important: first, reiterate the observation that has taken the Mrs. #Miranda that the #mexican Government has to assume the commitment to withdraw this unilateral rise of tariffs.
Without embargo, believe that the conclusion of the agreement will facilitate the continuity of the dialogue around these questions, which will plant to *Europa in a much more favourable position that #if it had not gone out forward this agreement.
Other modalities of participation, as for example the statute of observer, did not respect the legitimate wishes of *Islandia and Norwegian to follow taking part in the process of taking of decisions in matter of *Schengen in the future.
Apart from the agreement of association that finish to describe and #whose draft *les have remitted takes little, the Protocol of *Schengen foresees the approval of another agreement that determine the juridical relation among Norwegian and *Islandia, on the one hand, and among Big *Bretaña and *Irlanda, by #another, in the fields of the *acervo of *Schengen that apply  to these States.
It did not fits doubt that this control has to develop of an effective mood, and is necessary to demand to Norwegian and *Islandia #the same criteria that demand  to the States members of the Union in #everything it relative to the control of borders and to #some looks of the fight against the delinquency.
But to the contrary of it that occurred, for example, with the directive on the rights of author in the society of the information, in this occasion have had the opportunity to keep a brief debate *esclarecedor to the *respecto.
My question to the Commissioner *Liikanen is #if, nevertheless, results acceptable the form in that the amendment 48 has been formulated by the Commission of Subjects Juridical do not convert like this to the servers of Internet in *censores?
And since, as it said a famous writer of my country, «the morning is uncertain», take advantage of the occasion to hail and express my gratitude to #all the colleagues, civil servants and interpreters with the *cuales have shared these five fundamental years for the #european construction.
*Ello Do not means, without embargo, that the institutions do not have of the sufficient autonomy to decide  to increase the requirements contemplated in the Treaty in determined occasions, especially *cuando is in game the character *vinculante of the maximum type of increase, #such as it stipulates the article 203.
It takes a year decide to approve an interim agreement so that, in the meantime, #can negotiate the global agreement. And in that moment said explicitly that we #would not approve the global agreement until they had not stipulated  #all the elements that compose it.
The Government *laborista did not lose time to the hour to establish some new strict criteria for the public life in the Realm Joined *cuando got to the power two years ago.
On the other hand, I subscribe the idea of a simplification of the financial management. I create likewise indispensable to hold responsible to the States members and control the utilisation of the subventions agreed in virtue of these bottoms; of it contrary, the risks of fraud will multiply .
The future of the rural world presents  more uncertain by what the Commission and the Parliament, permanently concerned by *apropiarse of new fields of competition, procure to make an urban politics integrated, without taking into account the principle of subsidiariness.
We believe besides that the best way to reach a more efficient finance of the #european politics raisin for concentrating said finance in the measures absolutely more important, in place to create *minipresupuestos that *engullen too much money of the States members.
It treats  of #that that expand to the infinite the field of the community regulation, and that today, under the effect of the bureaucratic and administrative obstruction that have caused, demand a simplification of the existent procedures.
Later, has to summon  an international conference on the *Balcanes under the auspices of the *NU and of the *OSCE with the goal to stabilise the situation in the region and to guarantee in *Kosovo the establishment of an advanced autonomy inside the current borders.
This violence, precisely, is the answer to your violence of State, as it is the pity of death and also the racist justice and the justice of class that has condemned to *Mumia.
The lawyers of the Mr. *Ocalan hardly have access to the process, the Court of Security of the State neither *me seems the suitable place and have not admitted  international observers.
Nevertheless, #if, besides, we analyse the union *aduanera with *Turquía, since the agree, this country has separated  of *nosotros and the recent elections have put of self-evident that goes back the look to inside, goes back , therefore, more nationalist. With the experience of the *Balcanes there #be little space for the nationalist feelings and the rights of the *kurdos or, perhaps, precisely yes.
Gentleman President, lamentably, to the equal that in December of 1997, have to go back to *ocuparnos of the rapes of the human rights in *Djibuti, in particular of the situation of the political prisoners that no only find  subjected to illegal arrest -for *nosotros unacceptable-, but also to #all type of vexation that, in #some cases, has *ocasionado the death of #some of *ellos.
The Government of *Djibuti engaged  to respect these principles also through his participation in the Agreement of *Lomé, #whose article 5 foresees that each part signatory has to fulfil the principles of respect of the human rights and of democratisation of his country.
Gentleman President, lady speaker, *Señorías, wish first of all congratulate to the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens and, in particular, to our colleague *Gebhardt by the excellent work that have taken together and by the tenacity that have shown in the procedure of conciliation.
Through a happy collaboration, #among others with the Speaker of the sessions of conciliation, the Mrs. *Fontaine, has reached this commitment thanks to his common sense, his firmness and his tireless perseverance.
Since the statistics of the exchanges of sakes *intracomunitarios always are necessary, has created  *INTRASTAT, and the companies have been forced to provide the necessary variables to allow that this organism make said statistical.
By it that refers  to the first proposal, relative to the reduction of the number of variables collected, the procedure of conciliation allowed to get to a satisfactory result in relation with the initial proposal of the Commission.
And I do not deny that the content of the proposal of the Commission of principles of the years eighty deserves my support. Said of another mood, subscribe the content, but do not approve the method *intergubernamental.
The costs derived of the installation of mechanisms of interception run to charge of the operator of the network of telecommunications. To avert distortions of the competition is indispensable that these costs are similar in #all the inner market.
This project of agreement will constitute the juridical frame for the interception of #all the forms of telecommunications in the EU that results necessary to put in practice the system of surveillance EU-FBI.
The Mr. *Schulz has said with #all clarity it that the Mr. *Schmid has exposed by writing: this recommendation of the Council do not modifies in it more minimum the juridical situation in the States members.
Lady Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, before at all wanted to congratulate to the Mr. *Hoppenstedt for having known, in his last intervention, *llevarnos with precision to the essential point of the question: take compatible to the man, the nature and the modern technician.
These two bodies are developing the program detailed of activities and the strategies of communication in accordance with the lines of communication of the Commission and the report of the Commission of Culture.
*Señorías, our political activity is not *desenfrenada, but the #can compare to a train, no to a train of high speed, but to a train of commodities, but the trains do not advance #if there are not rails, and these rails are the that avert that *nos divert.
By this reason, #can say today, with independence of where *nos seat in this Assembly, it following: #if it exists a political justice, even in this European Parliament, this political justice has taken  reality with the election of #Nicole *Fontaine for Speaker of the European Parliament.
*Cuando Gave by closed the assembly to finals of May, there was an unanimous backrest and a strong ovation of #all the plenary by the so glorious form in the that has conducted the sessions along the last term of office.
With his contribution to the peaceful conclusion of the conflict of *Kosovo, the civil power that is the EU achieved to advance a fundamental step to a Common External Politics.
The preparation of a #european Letter of fundamental rights that decided  in Colony has by object guarantee that the fundamental rights of the citizens receive in the #european field #the same consideration that have in the national field.
It is evident that the last events that have observed in the *OMC and the form as they go to develop  the new negotiations and, in particular, the designation of the General Director wanted by the Americans for the *primer cycle of the *OMC are of very bad *augurio for the #european interests.
The last look, the subject of *Kosovo, has shown also, *me seems, the #european impotence and his total diplomatic dependency and military of the dominant military power and of the NATO.
With regard to the criticisms to the institutional reforms: we have tried *hacerlas advance and *cuando kept my first intervention here to the *hacerme load of the Presidency of the Council was not still at all clear #if we went to obtain really the approval for a Conference *Intergubernamental.
The challenge that have in front of #all *nosotros is in reconstructing the credibility of the European Union in front of his citizens and in ensuring that #this comprise the advantages that the European Union offers to his daily life.
#Any one that say today that we have to approve or refuse the Commission, the one who say #this here in the Parliament or out of this Parliament, is despising it as the «*hearings» are an important part of the whole of the process and, a time passed, will be able to decide freely #if we give our assent to the Commission or no.
We go to take all it possible -at least my political Group- so that in the frame of the audiences foresee  also a sufficient time for each candidate and candidate as an hour and average, #such as it is foreseen up to now, is not sufficient but that need at least three hours so that we #can keep a fine conversation *decisoria.
The Commission is the defender of the Treaties and *usted has employed the concept of the Government, a concept that *me enjoys personally because it involves that this Government has a parliamentary responsibility and has to answer also in front of the Parliament.
Lady Speaker, in September will have the audiences and, as I already have said, do not wish to anticipate how have to develop, but the big preference of my Group is that in subject -September always to the reservations that it will be necessary to see it that goes *sucediendo- will have to take a decision and *desembarazarnos of a feeling of #crisis.
The tragedy of *Kosovo, and in sense more general the tragedies of the type of the *sucedida in *Yugoslavia, are fine sample that the stability and the peace brought by the integration of *Europa still do not issue his rays much more there of the external borders of the Union.
The launching of the new coin of the euro definitely will help to reduce the commercial costs of the small and medium enterprises when converting  the operations *cambiarias in eleven countries in *algo of the past.
To boost the competitive capacity, the growth and the employment, the #finnish Government proposes , aptly, favour the coordination of the economic politics, of employment and structural and complete the inner market.
The EU has definitely an opportunity of gold to set up new politics in matter of rights of the consumers, alimentary security and help to the greater persons, #as well as in the areas of protection of the environment.
Already before the meeting of the European Council in Colony, the Commission proposed to the Bosses of State and of Government found a special Agency so that it occupied  of the execution of the measures of reconstruction.
*Me Have put in contact with the Minister of Subjects External of *Eslovaquia, country candidate to member of the Union, and have begun to consider the form to solve this look in the negotiations with said country.
To this subject *me referred *cuando *me *dirgí today to the representatives of the #european youths with occasion of the delivery of the prizes of literature, in my quality of representative of the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council in the day of his première, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, formulated the question on the case *Bangemann because I believe that it poses a question of enormous actuality, that is the ethical behaviour of the public charges.
In this context, *nosotros, also the deputies, have to struggle by some clear statutes, some rules of the clear game and *elaborarlas, as it do not serves of a lot throw stones to the roof of the other and not seeing that #one sometimes is under #the same ceiling.
They are the that #would say, and have, create *yo, the reason of his part, that the disposals of the article 213 of the Treaty and his references to the honesty and discretion mean for #any one that comprise the criteria required in the public life, little more #would need  say, or at all.
By discounted that it had wished that #ours *primer find during the period of the #finnish Presidency had occurred in other circumstances, which *me had allowed to expose #all the essential priorities of our program of work.
Thus it do not fits the lower doubt that the legislation of the Community has to be reformed with the end to guarantee that the quality of the products of origin animal was entirely reliable.
*Déjenme *decirle *algo To the President of the Council: in #some parts has said that the Council was concerned, as the crisis of the dioxin has put of self-evident that his effects affect to #all the Union, and that the Council wants to act of transparent and responsible way.
I think that in an economic and ecological disaster of #this *envergadura has to have  value to look for and signal the causes and in his case also to the guilty, no by any inopportune form of grudge, but to avert that they repeat  this type of problems in the future.
And here I want to remember, for example, how the community institutions have not followed the recommendations and requirements of the Parliament, that asked the prohibition of the flours of meat and bones in the animal feeding.
Therefore, we propose it following: open of course an investigation, but first take a study in depth of the systems to face up to the sanitary and alimentary panics of #all the States members, beginning with an evaluation of the #british system.
The possible reforms are *reexpedidas to level of the Unit of Fight *Antifraude and of the own Roman *Prodi, that yesterday *nos explained that it went to fix almost all modifying the internal operation of the Commission and proposing a code of behaviour of his members.
#This #would have supposed, for example, apply disciplinary measures against the organisers of the European Championship of 1996, because in that occasion, the followers benefited  of plans of sale of entrances that favoured to the fans of the country with regard to the fans of the foreigner.
The organisers of the *Eurocopa 2000 that will celebrate  in *Bélgica and in the Low Countries, for example, already have put  in contact with the Commission and, in consequence, have adapted his system of sales to the requirements of the community legislation.
#If the Commissioner *Kinnock *me is asking #if *yo believe that the European Commission #can really help to the football of base better that the anonymous societies multinationals that only look for benefits, #would vote by the European Commission.
Lady Speaker, our ancient Socialist colleague #belgian Mr. Of *Coene and *yo head the group of 30 deputies to the European Parliament that carried the case in front of the Upper Court of #París the past year.
#If the Commission had pursued this *incumplimiento of the article 82 with #the same energy that pursues the *incumplimientos in other fields of the industry, this fine #would not have been of 600 pounds, but of 6 millions of pounds or more.
With occasion of this Glass of the World of football, *Señorías, have seen to thousands of *Zidane and of #Marcel *Dessailly in small, that displaced  of the popular quarters of *Marsella, of *Tolosa and of *Estrasburgo to applaud the exploits of the big *Zidane, of the big *Dessailly, and also of the big #Owen, of the big *Beckam, of the big Say #Pietro.
It is wise, given the circumstances, demand to the great football quantities of money and deposit it in the arks of the European Commission, or it wise is to take measures that guarantee that in the future will not go back to produce  discriminatory sales of entrances for the football or any #another international tournament?
*Nosotros Pay expensive, maybe, the have not been able to take it, but *le #would ask to this Parliament an analysis *sosegado of the second inform of the Committee. And afterwards that, after the explanations of the Mr. *Kinnock, comprise that the Commission will need *algún time, and that they are *ustedes this time a bit more generous.
Forty-two years after the creation of this institution, it is necessary to remember to the ancient School, quote: the need "to hold responsible to the commissioners, from the preparation of a proposal until his application" .
Because the financial Regulation never has elaborated it quite the right of agreements" . #One #can not leave to have the worrisome impression, *cuando reads a sentence like #this, that the reasoning is incomplete.
And, to end of accounts, the theory of the independence of the Commission, credited by the federalistic, but that conducts to weaken the controls, has not provided *acaso a favourable terrain for the irregularities and the frauds *impunes?
Especially, the Commission promises to displace systematically of the traditional dependency of the #ex financial control-in front of to a system integrated of financial management in the that the responsibilities of civil servants individual are clearly clear-cut, evaluated and reinforced.
I consider urgently necessary that the recommendations taken to this *respecto by the Report of the Experts, and with independence of the statements that have taken the commissioners designated, are collected in the program of the next conference *intergubernamental and impose  by the road of the Treaties.
It is not the moment to go in in details, as in the Commission of Control Budgetary, thanks to the proposal that have made, will have opportunity to follow of wall the task of the Commissioner *Kinnock.
Gentleman President, debate a report of wall of 200 pages that contains an exhaustive analysis of the structural operation of the services of the Commission, and only have been able to have 48 hours to read it and *reflexionar on #the same.
They will be *ustedes of agreement *conmigo in affirming the importance of this community frame of cooperation with the that it pretends  back and complete the work of the States members in the field of the accidental marine pollution, precisely with the goal of *hacerla more effective.
Of it contrary, in front of the first crisis that *sobrevenga in front of the lack of the inspections of a Been member and of a #european logic of the inspections, will resort to an independent agency, that will be necessary to create to manage the question of the feeding, for example, as we #can check it *cuando debate said question.
I create firmly that the Parliament #would have to give all his support to this report and that #would have to issue  a message so much to the Commission as to the Council that have the intention that these essential measures are not diluted or weakened in any form.
The consequence #would be that the production #would displace  to the country #where governed the worst environmental norms; the environment #would be then the big loser and #would punish  to the States members that yes take  seriously the environmental legislation.
It do not go to occur it that *le has occurred to this spiritual leader of Occident that is the Mr. *Stoiber, President of the Government of *Baviera, that did not achieve that his minister *Sauter was piacular goat and accepted to resign and has had to resort to the corresponding Parliament.
The offers that *nos formulates, substantially demanded by my Group, constitute a clear commitment with the #european integration and #all a statement of intentions to the representation of the citizens that has this Parliament.
The euro is an instrument, an intermediate stage: it is a condition, a half to be able to carry prosperity to #all, so that it #can happen  to these politics that are the fundamental chapter that have in front of *nosotros, and the final goal, #this is, more growth, more development and more employment.
Because it has mentioned *usted with #everything hit the word "responsibility" like key concept, no only in the *primer report of the wise persons, but also like need to solve the problems in the future. Collegiate responsibility, but also individual, of the members of his Commission and -think also- responsibility of his civil servants.
Gentleman professor *Prodi, is *usted a man of big talent, is surrounded also of men and of women also of big talent: the professor *Monti, the gentleman *Barnier, the gentleman *Busquin, that survived #where the lady *Cresson dropped by a pot of jam, and this full Commission of talent goes to have early the big appointment of *Seattle.
The vote of the Thursday is an important opportunity to send to the new Commission a warning that the principle by the that it guides  *Bruselas #can not be the attitude that here it has not happened at all.
The nomination of the Mr. *Kinnock and of the Mr. *Patten underlines clearly the impression of that the nomination for the Commission is in effect a prize of *consolación to compensate the political rejection in his own country.
This morning, gentleman President, has affirmed that wishes a whole and effective administration, some competent and free commissioners of #all suspicion, a political program for the next five years in total communication with the Parliament.
Like person and like President of the Commission, explains *usted with the confidence even of those deputies of the Union that see with a big scepticism to his squad, which means that *usted personally will be able to have the affirmative vote of our Group in both votes.
Gentlemen Presidents, the world, from *Kosovo until *Timor Oriental, needs to *Europa, the *Europa of the Institutions of the Union, and the European Union needs a fine relation among the Council, the Commission and the Parliament to enjoy of #all the confidence of his *conciudadanos.
*Nosotros, the #greek deputies of the party *Nea *Dimocratía, further of #all reservation, *le will give the vote to his Commission, in the first place because we expect that they respect *ustedes the commitments contracted here the past week, and second because we agree with the content of his statement of today.
The Parliament has interest in defending the powers of the Commission and mainly his right of initiative, without which the weight of the Governments and of the national bureaucracies #would be overwhelming.
Especially it is a scandal that take  happen to a man like the right hand of the ancient President of the Commission, Mr. *Delors, the one who is responsible of the training of the criticised services of security, in front of this Parliament without that it receive at least an alone critical question.
Never we have to allow that a government use the Commission like house of retreat of politicians that - using an affine term to the consumers - have exceeded his "date of caducity" or as *recompensa political to ancient friends or even to export to *Europa a national embarrassment.
*Nosotras Want to that *usted commission  to reach significant improvements in the income, in the access to the power and to the money, and that  #one to our fight against the daily discrimination of the women and against the violence.
Due to the fact that we had to leave time to the delegations of other commissions, neither the deputies of my Group neither our commission neither the members of the delegations had sufficient time to formulate #all the questions that wished to the candidates *Liikanen and *Lamy.
Also in this look, *yo #can affirm in name of my Group that the Commission seems to have the firm will to regulate in the round of the #millenium, #among others subjects, questions like the norms *agrosociales and also the #european environmental disposals.
Gentleman President, *le appreciate that *me have mentioned, even unintentionally, because *yo have got to the European Parliament like leader of the Party of the Pensioners that has gone in for the first time in this Parliament to represent the needs of the greater persons.
*Me Remembered to a famous duet of humorists of the Realm Joined - *Morecombe and *Wise - in the that #Eric *Morecombe *aporreaba a piano of tail and took a frightful noise, and *André *Previn *le said "*te #this *equivocando in #all the notes" , to it that *él answered, "the notes are #all well, the problem is that no the touch in the correct order" .
With regard to the Category 5, the #sad side is that we do not see that the Council propose solutions on the mood to resolve the problem of the pensions in the breast of the institutions.
In this context, is important that the European Parliament, #whose action this last year has been remarkable, take to hear his voice after the resolution adopted in his session *plenaria of April that already established the political frame that now  precise.
As it said before, the *concretización of a space of freedom, of security and justice is a fundamental goal for *acercar the Union to his citizens, and this question forms part of the daily worries of the citizens of the Union.
On the other hand, *me cheer that the Popular Party European, with the support of the other friends of the security of this House, have reached to impose his initiative in spite of the Group of the *socialdemócratas, that denied  to examine the subject.
A lot it has said  about the suitability to take the most difficult life for the criminals, but the harmonisation of offences and sanctions is an ambitious project.
This type of attempts against the free expression, leaving sideways to the citizens, *cuando prepares  the space of security and of justice, awake the suspicion that this space will not be so free and transparent as they demand our traditions.
The countries members of the EU, like previous condition to reach the peace and the security in *Europa, have to work more actively by this peace, security, economic growth and democracy in the bordering poor countries to the EU.
It is evident that want that the prime ministers offer protection against threats like the delinquency organised, the traffic of drugs, the terrorism and the sexual offences, but also have to occupy of the threats of the discrimination and the racism.
I ask an applause for *ellos so much more what that the news of another grave tremor of earth, in the northwest of *Turquía, this Monday, so only some weeks after the tragic events that have affected to this same region, *nos has inspired a big affliction.
In name of the European Parliament, wanted to express my deeper charm to the Big National Assembly and to the village of *Turquía by the grave losses that *les has supposed this natural catastrophe.
#If they establish  social and economic rights #whose finance was too much dependent of the public sector, simultaneously with the improvement of the social level inside the Union go to grow also the walls that *nos separate of the external world.
These politics rather will have to relate *decididamente with the politics of development and cooperation, that, with the step of the time, lady Speaker of the Council, and had account of the economic means that have arbitrated , seems that it has not obtained results.
I estimate that the Commission has to recognise also that the content expanded of the procedure of *codecisión means that the Parliament has #the same authority in the promulgation of directives and regulations of the European Union that correspond to 38 economic sectors and social different.
The procedure of *codecisión covers a wide range of activities, with inclusion of the activities of the sector of the transport, regional subjects, social questions, initiatives in matter of employment, structural finance, protection of the consumer, public health and the environmental worries.
*Me Am referring to the global autonomy, to the capacity and exclusive competition that keeps the Basque Country in fiscal matter, of collection of #all the taxes, taxes and public exactions, #as well as in the budgetary looks and of public cost.
Neither we have been able to give our seen well to this Commission for the following period since #some of the candidates have not engaged  *unívocamente to assume the total and individual responsibility that corresponds to the charge that occupy.
The intervention of the President of the Commission puts end to #all the work in the commissions, in the that has had  the opportunity to appreciate the political positions of the diverse Commissioners.
Concerning the external politics and of defence, has underlined  the insistence in the federalistic path and of strengthening of the militaristic positions of the *PESC, instead of the decisive stake by the politics of cooperation.
The strong pressure exerted on the deputies of the European Parliament so that they approve the new Commission, allowing of this form that go back to the "normality" in our activities, it is necessary *contrastarla with the deep doubts and reservations that characterise to #some looks of the squad of *Prodi.
During the winter of 1998/1999 the European Parliament reached the majority of age, caused the resignation of the Commission *Santer and of this way established the place that *le corresponded in the political order European.
#This shows that the Parliament and the Commission of Budgets act with total responsibility in the questions of economy of the European Union and in the development of different political, and also is proof of his capacity of adaptation to new situations.
Besides #this #would take that the intervention of an international strength of peace #can not  consider an interference in the #indonesian sovereignty, but a help of the international community to an independent State and sovereign.
The socialist Group demanded from the beginning the end of the economic help of the World-wide Bank and of the International Economic Bottom to the diet of *Yakarta.
Now well, in the context of the catastrophe that is *sucediendo there, Indonesian has happened to convert  in a symbol of it a lot that a diet without scruples, feeble and brutal is able to take to impose his can and his control on #all the that, to his trial, challenge his authority.
How *sucede with the institutions of *Europa -the European Parliament, the European Union in his group- that *nos prevents that we answer to the crises of the world like our villages, our constituents, our citizens wanted to that we answered?
The Council of Security of the UN has adopted this morning the decision to send troops of pacification in an immediate future, and will allocate  #some strengths of crash to the zone of mood urgent.
The deployment of the humanitarian help is urgent, and his priorities are the protection of the deported to *Timor Western and the access of the *ACNUR to the zone, #as well as the start of the distribution of foods and utensils by aerial transport.
It #would be particularly interesting to listen the reactions of #París, *Berlín and *Madrid and of #many other places #where has interpreted  the decision of Colony like another more directed step to the implantation of a common defence.
How attitude has the #finnish Presidency concerning the preparation of laws secretly, because in the actuality the Council of Ministers do not has his the same more that in *Beijing and in *Corea of the North by it that refers  to the approval of laws on citizens secretly?
The international community has engaged  to apply in his whole the resolution 1244 adopted by the Council of Security of the UN, by means of the *cual tries  create a *Kosovo democratic and multinational inside the borders of the Republic of *Yugoslavia recognised internationally.
Gentleman president, believe that the answer of the President in exercise and the debate on the previous question have contributed data on the selective way with that the called international community tackles the existent problems all over the world, among *ellos the situation that reigns in the *Balcanes.
I know that it is not necessary to convince to this Assembly, but like direct and main participant in the task of *paliar the suffering and reconstruct the normality and like coordinator of the efforts of #others, the European Union has to assume the maximum possible responsibility.
The Mrs. *Pack has shown  especially *valerosa when ordering the disaster organised by the Council and has proposed a totally logical solution, is to say, establish the agency in *Pristina and *vincularla to the pact of stability in *Tesalónica.
For *ello will stand out three looks: In the first place, for an alone dispatch do not take fault two organs of government; second, the taking of decisions has to produce #where make  the work or Agency of Reconstruction of *Kosovo; and in *tercer place, the collaboration with the local population is important, and of form expresses the cooperation *pluriétnica as it has stood out .
Logically, therefore, the agency has to have his base of operations there, although to the hour to defend this option, am safe that nobody will forget the arguments so *persuasivos that the Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit has presented in the debate of today on previous experiences.
Therefore the commission approved the need of a continuous and rigorous support to the refugees and has accepted the *décimo Agreement *CE-*OOPS for the period 1999-2001, that has subjected  to the *dictamen of the European Parliament and that represents a big contribution.
Gentleman President, this report has been approved by unanimity in the Commission of Development and Cooperation, and with #a lot of tarpaulin, with the two amendments presented by the Commission of Budgets so that all do not remain only in words, but that have a financial economic-plan.
For example, I have taken fine note that #ours Assembly finishes to refuse the original editorial of the section 6 of the resolution, that considered impossible to make the space of freedom, of security and of justice keeping the rule of the unanimity in the Council.
The *socialdemócratas #danish in the European Parliament *nos have abstained in the vote of the proposal of resolution relative to the increase of the integration in the space of freedom, security and justice.
Besides, neither we support the wish that the summit of *Tampere was the starting signal for the celebration of a new governmental conference on the increase of the integration in the judicial field.
As it will know the Assembly, the financial situation general in *Rusia has reached a true stability from the spectacular fall of the rouble in the markets of currencies international in August of the past year.
They cover likewise, in opinion of the Commission, to the important exit of capital of *Rusia, that obviously has contributed to his time to drop the level of investment international and has braked the economic growth.
In front of similar panorama, a timely measure of the President *Yeltsin as it is his approval of the proposal of law #russian on the bleaching of money #would reassure to the international community.
Likewise, as a result of the visit of the #finnish Presidency and of the Commissioner go give *Broek to *Turquía on 26 August, is gathering  at present a financial package of 30 millions of euros to contribute to the activities of help and reconstruction in course.
We entrust in that these initiatives of support to short, half and long term will suppose a continuous help to the population of *Turquía and are safe that persons of #all the European Union will join  to *nosotros in the wish that the arduous tasks of *restablecimiento of the communities and of the morals succeed.
#The same reaffirm, finally, our wish that the dialogue continue only in the measure in that it allow an advance in the field of the human rights in that country, so that, in particular, suspend  the execution of the convictions to death that have been pronounced.
Meanwhile, the international situation continues deteriorating and the reiterated international calls to the #burmese authorities so that they take measured directed to boost the democracy, the human rights and the reconciliation remain without a significant answer.
These activities #would owe likewise support the mixed military Commission attendant to organise the deployment of a strength of maintenance of the peace and a strength of *imposición of the peace.
As well, in this dispatch there #be not neither a window neither a taking of air and do not know #if the photocopier, extremely noisy, produces hurtful broadcasts for the health of the person that commissions  of #the same.
To take advantage of of an efficient way this building, have to procure celebrate here in his whole our session *plenaria, included the Friday, so that afterwards we have #all a week, in the that, #such as it has proposed #ours colleague, the Mrs. *Ludford, #can *dedicarnos of way especially intense to #ours *circunscripciones electoral.
#Any one that know #which is the political activity of a deputy, and the reservation of #many of his conversations and of his performances, #can understand that #this is, possibly, the deepest defect and more structural and that, as it said the Mrs. Speaker, possibly do not have solution.
My main request is that, as it needed  a change of the treaty for *traernos here in the first place, with security #can *presionar in our political parties, our governments, to achieve a change of the treaty that *nos move away to #all of here and spend the money in *algo useful that the persons #can appreciate.
#Any one that already have exposed  to the use of buildings new, as it is my case, knows that it is necessary a time of shooting; inside six months, these details will have forgotten .
Equally, I foresee that the beautiful carpets colour cream put in #some of the stays of the commissions will be *irreversiblemente full of stains and dirty inside 3 months and will be unavailable, being an election of the poor and little practical colour and in last instance a waste of resources.
#If other States members begin to act of #the same mood, #can get to a situation in the that determined articles #would be forbidden in each Been member of the Community in different moments, and will not exist any guarantee that it work properly the only market, by #whose creation and consolidation so much *nos have encouraged in this Parliament.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Commission, #if the *PPE did not wish that this debate took place in the day of today was not by not to consider it important, but simply to be able to clear a series of things and *oir to a series of experts before pronouncing .
It has to follow contemplating the consumer that the withdrawal of earths agricultural in the EU, or was, the renunciation to cultivate cereals, while they incinerate  the corpses of animals and feeds  to the livestock with animal flours?
In the debate have to take into account -#this is important - #all the problems of the agriculture and prevail the agriculture of quality, #as well as assign a space to the question of the relation among technical control and democratic control, aroused by the Mrs. *Roth-*Behrendt.
The second is that, given the *prevalencia of the AIDS in *África and knowing that thousands of youngsters cross the Mediterranean to go in, through *España or of other countries, in *Europa, and taking into account also the period of incubation of the illness, that goes of six or seven years until twelve years, #can reckon  that #one third part of these youngsters is affected of AIDS and is living in *Europa.
The third consideration in *pro of a favourable vote of this proposal is the relatively scarce quantity of the help, that did not has to disturb the economic plans of the Commission.
Second, that, logically, will correspond to the budgetary authority, to *ustedes like Parliament, to the Commission in his proposals and to the Council in his decisions, take the decisions that estimate timely for the year 2000 without that, without embargo, in this moment prejudge #which is the definite solution.
The Parliament aspires to that include  in the article 5 of the program *ALTENER a reference to the new procedures for the exercise of the competitions in matter of execution, so as to reinforce the participation of the European Parliament.
It did not suffices with seeing the figures, totally insufficient, that go to devote to the renewable energies, #would be necessary perhaps also devote a bit of time to examine the financial energies that devote to other forms of energy, in particular to the nuclear.
Together with the program *SAVE, have in *ALTERNER *II a form to show to the public of *Europa that there are rational forms to confront the challenge of the climatic change: energetic efficiency and sources of renewable energy.
In contrast with it that occurs in the great energetic companies, #where are sacking  hard-working, this fact means that #if we launch this program and boost the sources of energy alternative, at the same time will contribute also, like Europeans, to that the politics of employment receive greater attention.
Gentleman President, lady speaker, lady Commissioner, wanted to manifest my gratitude to the speaker, the Mrs. *Ahern, by the dynamism with that has prepared the program *plurianual 1998-2000 of promotion of the energetic efficiency *SAVE *II for the *segunda reading, continuing the work of the ancient speaker, the Mrs. *Bloch *von *Blottnitz.
A greater energetic efficiency will involve, in the short term, lower consumption, the protection of the renewable energetic sources, a lower dependency of the imports of energy, #as well as a lower environmental pollution.
The Commission goes to present in brief -is included in the diary of the next Council of 2 December- the plan of action on energetic efficiency, and then will have occasion to argue more in depth these questions.
Already they have swept  the institutional racism and the intolerance and the prejudice legalised have been swept and now the relation of the European Union with *Sudáfrica goes determined by the recognition of this attainment *transcendental.
They have produced  substantial advances in the schooling of the boys, in the medical service of vicinity, in the access to the drinkable water and in the service of electricity but remains still a lot, a lot for taking.
Gentleman President, although we recognise that the Agreement of Trade, Development and Cooperation among the European Community, by a part, and the Republic of *Sudáfrica, by #another, contains certainly valuable elements, share the doubts of the speaker *Kinnock and have #some questions and suggestions for the Commission and the Council.
#Ours *cuarta observation is related with the *virulenta critical of the Mrs. *Kinnock *cuando ensures that the European Union "tried to take of *Sudáfrica the hostage of the subventions of his own agriculturalists". We consider unacceptable that the Agreement take case *omiso of the sector of the wines and of the alcoholic drinks.
It is to expect that this agreement involve that from *Sudáfrica perceive  that they no longer are the EU and *Sudáfrica so far, neither physical neither *psíquicamente, and that no longer there #be *tanta distance among the facts and the words, as undoubtedly they have felt that *sucedía during the period comprised among the years 1994 and 1999.
Gentleman Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperate with *Sudáfrica, *ayudarle to go out of the underdevelopment #would have to be an elementary duty for *Europa, #whose classes leaders have benefited  amply in the past of the pillage of his mining wealths and of the exploitation of his poor masses.
Gentleman President, did not fits doubt that, from the point of sight political, the agreement reached with *Sudáfrica constitutes in his group a step advance for the European Union, and in this sense it is necessary to consider it with special like and satisfaction.
Without going in in the *inadecuación in principle of this type of indications, wish to underline that the two parts are working very *denodadamente with seen to find a fast and mutually acceptable solution for the pending problems in matter of wines and liquors.
The conference of *Lesotho goes  to celebrate the days 13 and 14 October and are had to examine in *ella with representatives of the countries *BLNS the form to restructure the plan of support for these countries.
I will not answer, therefore, to this concrete question, as I am not in situation to take it, but take advantage of his invitation because *yo same, *cuando begin to examine the great percentages of costs, meeting that, more that the future needs, is the history the that is marking our path.
The solutions for the unemployment are exactly #the same that the corresponding to the competitiveness, is to say, the reduction of the business contributions and the levels of regulation. )How attitude will adopt the Commission concerning these looks?
Nevertheless, #if *usted *me asks #which is the *primer factor for *Europa and his industrial problems, *le answer very frankly: the problem of the human resources like incentive of the *empresariado that there #be in our continent and, therefore, #all the problem of the conditioning of the financial structures for the new *empresariado.
The European Union did not wants that this agency have his headquarters in *Lausanne, in the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee, and, without embargo, wants that the have in #one of the States members of the European Union.
The Indian is the greater democracy of the world and has confronted #hideous problems precisely because it is a free society that lives in a State of right, with a civil society fully developed.
#If well I receive with *beneplácito the question and the answer that has given -suit with *él in that *demasiada insistence in the summits is not necessarily timely-, *me #would enjoy to know #if it will consider the possibility to expand the dialogue #India/EU so that pass to be a dialogue EU/*subcontinente #indian.
It treats  of a paper that the EU #can exert usefully: the to reach that the Indians, the *paquistaníes or the *bangladeshíes, etc., gather  in #that *subcontinente to examine his common problems and, in some sense, take of selfless external runner in the deals among the countries of this *subregión.
Up to now the States members, to tenor of the article 296 (ancient article 223), have excepted up to now the traffic of arms of the field of application of the disposals of the Treaties of the European Community.
This *primer step consists in conceding to *Turquía the status of candidate so that it set up the process and have an opportunity to be able to talk in a next future on the subject of the start of negotiations.
Lady Speaker, estimated and estimated colleagues, after the statements made by the representative of the Presidency of the Council and of the Commission, it is necessary to split of the fact that in the summit of *Helsinki goes  to agree concede to *Turquía the status of candidate.
Lady Speaker, our Group declares  in favour of the #european path of *Turquía, that #can get until his adhesion, and also declares  in favour of a political more generous in the finances, always that #this #can contribute to solve the problems to the that they confront , especially, the numerous victims of the earthquakes.
The #greek village has shown his cordial feelings to the #turkish village in the tragedy of the earthquakes. I believe that also the #turkish village has feelings of affection to the #greek village.
#This it #would be necessary to take it recognising that to *Turquía *le remains a long path for visiting, fundamentally regarding the situation of the human rights and of the rights of the villages and minorities, recognised or no, that integrate the population of that country and also in relation with the performance of *Turquía concerning *Chipre.
The election of a new Government more constructive in #Israel and the signature of the Memorandum of *Sharm The-*Sheikh the past month have *allanado the path for the resumption of the process of peace.
The first withdrawn of troops, the release of prisoners and the agreement reached yesterday on the opening of the runner among *Gaza and *Cisjordania show that so much #israeli like Palestinians have restarted his efforts for reaching a durable peace.
I support the right of the #palestinian village to constitute a State, but a State that was the fruit of the negotiation and of the fine will of #all the parts interested and no a State that arise like result of the *coacción.
The president *Pasqua already has taken upsetting in the problem of the fault of translation; today our Group underlines that no only exists a fault of translation, but that there are inaccurate translations.
Today we have a perfect example with the decision of the Commission to raise the embargo of the meat of bovine #british, and the refusal of *Francia and of *Alemania to apply this decision.
Although the EU has engaged  to follow of wall and legislate the activity of the sector, in my opinion, the involved have the moral responsibility to approve a series of norms of forced fulfillment.
By this reason, the Union considers important that the sustainable development was the point of game of the negotiations and that the environmental questions are taken in account in the agreements on the different sectors.
Like this, our Parliament has approved an amendment of my Group, that requested a review of the mechanisms of the *OMC, of the procedure of solution of conflicts, to end to be able to take in account in greater grade the social questions, sanitary, cultural and environmental.
Gentleman President of the Council, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, the communication of the Commission to the national Parliaments is extremely *reveladora at the same time of the machinery deeply *antidemocrática of the main #european institution and of the conditions in the *cuales will initiate  the new chapter of commercial negotiations *multilaterales.
For the countries in roads of development, #this will mean free access for #all the articles, compensation by the increase of prices in basic alimentary products, exemptions of the agreements *TRIPS and that the EU delete the subsidies that produce disloyal competition, especially in the agricultural products.
And this reality is the of an agriculture *multifuncional, that combines his economic function with the preservation of the environment and of the rural landscapes and guarantees the presence of the man in #all the territory.
Like this, it is necessary, *prorrogando the phenomenon and so as to create  a relation of strengths favourable in the breast of the *OMC, debate, transmit to #all *Europa the sense that has to give to the globalisation, to the liberalisation of these commercial exchanges.
In our political group, #many are of the opinion that the trade on the broadcasts, the rescue of the obligation to reduce the broadcasts of CO2, is not *defendible politically.
*Me Have referred to that prepare the publication of a Green Book that will contain a concrete proposal in this sense, a system that obviously will describe the particular responsibility of each country.
It means #this that *Finlandia, country militarily neutral, is had to establish a common politics of defence inside the Union, with seen to that the Union have a common will, a common politics and a common voice?
*Le #Would ask to the Mr. Minister on the form in that the #finnish Presidency is elaborating the habilitation of the qualified majority in the taking of decisions in matter of external politics, security and common defence.
This process is still in course, so that it is impossible to say #if it will affect to the external politics and of security, although #if *nos fix a bit in the history of this process of preparation, it is necessary to say that the taking of decisions *vinculantes by qualified majority, for example in matter of defence, is not very #likely, at least in the short term.
To *él it is necessary to add the article 30 that has that the deposit #can increase with the currencies until ten times more, is to say, 50.000 millions of euros; besides, it exists a disposal in the point 4 of the article 30 according to the *cual the #ECB #can *emplazar currencies, also above the maximum that is established in 50.000 millions of euros.
Always we have had *algún point of the program that has treated  publicly but the rest of the meeting, in #all case up to now, has been to enclosed doors and will continue being it in the future, at least during the #finnish Presidency.
Second, #if there are criteria so different according to the *cuales forbid  precisely the exports of arms to *Yugoslavia but, for example, yes are allowed to Indonesian, then is that there are other different criteria to the of the code that are decisive, in concrete, the economic and commercial interests.
It is urgent because we still have not defined the form to control the diffusion of arms short and light arms, neither have expanded the code so that it cover the conventional arms.
The last meaning of the granting of this prize is, from the altruistic optics of this lawyer, that *Bielorrusia #can not be "a #black sheep" in the geographic map European.
The transparency is a value to the *cual this Parliament has referred  with decision in the first weeks of his works and the public opinion has right to entrust in the political institutions, #as well as in the military.
In consequence, consider just that the European Parliament ask to the States members that #can collaborate in discovering the truth, that facilitate to the #italian judicature #all the necessary documentation to get to the definite determination of the responsibilities.
#This *recalca, in particular, the question of the general culture in matter of security in the plant and the grade of qualification of the personnel, #as well as the importance that there #be a fast diffusion of the information.
The transport of fuels *MOX effects  under the control of the national authorities of the countries of origin and of destination, having properly in account the appropriate legislation of the Union and the norms of the *OIEA.
Without embargo, know perfectly -and our experience, so much in the breast of the European Parliament as of the #european society in general, shows it- that the mere *constatación is not sufficient. It is not sufficient, #if they want to, repeat the point of sight that "it is necessary to take *algo" .
In the case of the deputies is precise a specific decision, that #can foresee -for example, in relation with the parliamentary investigations- a council of control aside, chosen by our Assembly to the beginning of each term of office.
By this reason, the public opinion wait that this office possess a full capacity of work, and this full capacity of work refers , on the one hand, to the institutions in the that the *OLAF #can make investigations, reason by the *cual, celebrate the report of the Mr. *Napolitano and the interventions that have made  here.
Second, and with #this finish, wanted to insist in it important and urgent that is to possess, at last, regulations for the providers of services of certification regarding his access to the market, to the application of the principles that govern in the inner market, and to the relative regulations to the responsibility.
The second is the disposal according to the *cual the technical requirements will expand  in the future by means of a procedure of committee of regulation, to end to introduce new norms for the deposits of fuel that contain gaseous fuels.
It pretends  that the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions happen to have his headquarters in the ancient facilities of the Parliament that have remained *desocupadas, is to say, in the buildings *Belliard *I and *II, in the that previously they will take  dramas.
It is very natural that demand  that this new obligation of cost, that to #the same time #would mean the reduction of the costs of the States members, do not remain included in the maximum limit of the previously approved costs.
In the first place, in the three computations that have on the table, or was, the preliminary draft of the Commission and the proposals of the Council and of the Parliament, the planned costs for the exercise 2000 surpass, in fact, the amounts of this year.
In the year 2000, the EU will spend less of 2 euros by citizen in education, in boosting that the youngsters take part in programs of exchange or purchase knowledges on different tongues and cultures, or in informing to the citizens on the future evolution of the European Union at the same time that it supports  to our audiovisual industry.
We #can not *oponer the poor to the poor, the fine and the bad victims, and wail that the Council have posed in some mood the problem in these terms, without contributing any solution.
By the side of these organisations is comprehensible, because the Commission is failing gravely in his duties, *cuando the organisations have to expect during a year and half the assignment of subventions, or *cuando produce  intermediate modifications of the criteria.
Regarding the Structural Bottoms, the regional politics European has converted  in a true obstacle for *Francia, to the contrary of it that says a legend that keeps  of form *complaciente, even by the commissioner commissioned in the actuality of the regional politics.
The merit of the speaker is the to have it made by means of a budgetary procedure that developed  besides with the greater tranquility, although the Parliament is launching an important challenge to the Council, and believe that this challenge deserves to be stood out.
I #can not leave to underline, without embargo, that the budget of this year will not be able to fulfil the goals fixed to the principle, is to say, the relaunching of the economy of the Union and, especially, the growth of the employment.
*Nos Has taken a beautiful study with a species of *popurrí of #everything it that has written from the month of March and with a behaviour of adviser of the Court of Accounts #french.
In consequence, the efforts made in *pro of the meat of *vacuno of quality, of the fruits and vegetables and of the dairy products ran the risk to see  cancelled whereas this action forms part of the of the Community that will be able to include in the green box to level of the *OMC.
It means also that the military invasion is not an acceptable method to expand the borders, was the one who went the author of this act, are *cuales were the conditionings and the geopolitical interests that take part.
Gentleman President, in the time that I have want to *referirme to an only line of the budget that is the of the plan of distribution of milk in the schools, in the that the Commission has proposed to reduce the endowment of 96 millions of euros to 53 millions of euros.
Like the programs *plurianuales have to be, anyway, adapted to the *rúbrica budgetary corresponding and to the general perspective of the finance of the budget, consider indispensable that the Parliament improve his internal coordination during the reading of the programs *plurianuales and of the budget.
The expectation of the contribution is converting  in the strongest bond for #a lot of communities, no only local, a contribution that consolidates more that other ideal bonds or of another type.
I concede a special importance - #as well as, as I create, the Commission of Budgets - to that these commitments receive a *concretización written above the letter, very interesting, that the lady *Schreyer *nos has remitted, to the *cual the president *Wynn has answered and that, create, demands #some complementary precisions.
Another subject, that tackles his commission, is the contribution of the #ECB to the financial stability, and in concrete the question of the supply of liquidity of emergency to the financial institutions in difficulties.

To institutional level, the Central Bank plays a key paper; and also we wanted to that this paper had his *contrabalanza in the exigible transparency to the institutions that emanate of the votes of the citizens.
But #any of *nosotros doubts of the importance of his paper because a national government of the zone of the euro that confront  to the reflation of an economy *vacilante do not has #a lot of arms to his disposal.
The European Parliament, in quality of representative of the #european citizens, has to have right to demand that in the future, to similarity of it that *sucede with the other central banks, also the #ECB publish the arguments presented in favour or against of his decisions in monetary matter.
Finally, I want to affirm that I support warmly the relative proposal to the publication of the reports on the economic situation and the different economic indicators of the countries of the zone of the euro.
The #ECB is in the entirely involved actuality in #all the debates of #all the international forums on the future of it that now designates  the "financial architecture" of the world.
We know that in the practice, in the daily operations, go to have to *racionalizar the procedures so much as it was possible but, in general, #this has not identified , in the group of the process of evaluation, as #one of the main questions.
The way in that the *codecisión #can be *eventualmente put in practice in the relations among the Parliament, the Council and the States members in the taking of decisions in the field of the humanitarian activities is *algo that it has to follow being #discussed and even negotiated.

Of #the same mood, regret the *renuencia of #some States members to the hour to support the idea of a #european bottom for the refugees, in spite of that, as it explained clearly the Commission, this bottom did not comport new or supplementary cost #any.
The Treaty of Prohibition Complete of the Nuclear Essays benefits to #all the States of the world, and the European Union acts correctly *cuando reiterates his deep commitment that the Treaty go in in vigour what before.
In the first place because the subject of the inner security has been carried to the level of the Bosses of Government separating of the looks rather *competenciales of the Ministers of Justice and of the Interior.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Council, *Señorías, *Tampere has been an important step to in front and believe that with the initiatives to create an authentic *Europa of the citizens in the field of the juridical politics and of interior, has reached  a big progress.
This politics "*interpilares" opens possibilities that #can *llevarnos to good port, but also *me poses #a lot of questions on #who and how go to develop these plans of action and #if the Council *nos will give #any time information on the results of the that already set up, that is the plan of action relative to the *Iraq.
The goal has to be an open European Union and safe that establish associations with the countries of origin of the migratory flows and put ready political of conjoint development with the countries of origin and of traffic.
Of #the same mood as it did not takes  the peace not resorting simply to the arms, a common juridical space European will not create  only #if a bunch of Governments announces his fine will.
Like this, as, I repeat it: the Commission and the European Parliament exert his paper when elevating the goals of this conference and *cuando recommend that they take  now #all the necessary reforms so that our Union #can receive to a big number of States.
These subjects -the number of Commissioners in a Union expanded, the new weighting of the votes, the field of application of the qualified majority- are, the three, subjects extraordinarily difficult, but necessary.
Thus, like Group of the Popular Party European of the Christian Democrats and of the European Democrats say that we want to more of it that has posed  like perspective in *Amsterdam, want a reform in depth of the European Union that it was able of an enlargement, it that for *nosotros has a big priority.
For *ello, takes lacking to have also the value to modify the article 4 of the Treaty of the *CE that defines to the Union of a classical mood *neoliberal like an economy of market with a free competition.
Third, the Commission #would commission  to inform the next year on the possibility to extend the activities of the Agency to other #balkan countries with a new regulation.

A moment, *Señorías, it is necessary to see the benefits in Bag of #all the companies from takes a year, from two years ago, and have to remember to the Mr. *Wurtz that takes part or his friends take part in a Government that at all takes so that they cease the benefits in Bag.
*Eso Means to study where #can reduce the charge of rules unnecessary that #put the costs for the companies and study how measured #can reduce the costs no *salariales of the companies that, to his time, *les carry to sack to workers like the best mood of *economizar great sums of money.
Have, to #european level, the #european strategy for the employment, and applies  for the first time, with 22 directives that have incorporated  to the projects for the employment of the States members; and also there are important finances, to the that *me have referred previously.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the rejection by part of the American Senate of the Treaty of prohibition total of nuclear proofs.
It is an absolute irresponsibility use the ratification of the moratorium of the atomic proofs like toy *arrojadizo in the open internal fight among the republican Congress and the democrat president.

This circumstance has to his time some positive effects in the fight by the respect of the human rights and against the racism, a nationalism exaggerated and the antisemitism.
In #few words, have to purchase this capacity of adaptation and this speed in the cultural exchange, the training and the professional experience that are the elements that will request  increasingly in the society of the next #millenium.
"Youth" is a program that #can reach these goals, since it will allow to the youngsters with less resources and more disadvantaged carry out some transnational experiences that will be determinants for his more adapted incorporation to the labour world.
On the other hand, the sentence of the Court of Justice of 12 May 1998, relative to the juridical foundations, imposed the endowment of a better frame defined in comparison with the past, precisely by the confusion that existed previously.
Likewise, it wanted to stand out that #if it interrupted  the community participation in the Observatory, the Commission #would see  forced to collect this same information of other sources; in the majority of the cases, on a commercial base.
To improve the global situation of the Parliament and of the Group of No inscribed, *me associate with the radicals. In consequence, do not go to take part in the approval of the Record neither in the other votes, *declarándome in strike like *ellos.
Obviously, His *Señorías will vote freely, but have to know that from the moment in that they approve an amendment of costs that surpass it agreed "in lathe" , #would say *yo, of the Commission of Budgets and no "by" the Commission of Budgets, run the risk of *ponernos in a very delicate situation regarding the *margen.
Report (To5-0036/1999) of the Mr. *Napoletano, in name of the Commission of Subjects Constitutional, on possible modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the European Office of Fight *Antifraude (*OLAF)
The Council of *Amsterdam, that has given his name to the Treaty, had studied this question and refused explicitly recognise the existence of parties political Europeans and, less still, *otorgarles a public finance.
Of face to the future, the greater challenge of the EU consists in defining common basic principles that contribute to the reflation of the #european economy. In this way, will be able to solve  big part of the problems related with the market of work.
My colleagues that belong to this commission elaborated a project of amendment with the end to expand the finance of groups of women to a wider variety of *ellos.
To #the same time that accept that it has allowed  the subsistence of an agreement *monopolístico, celebrate the new permission of 600.000 euros and #would celebrate new increases in the future of this quantity, in the hope, clear is, that it contribute to that they #can listen the voices of #all the women.
#This *cotización #would constitute #one of the elements -although, definitely, #would not be the only- of a system of readjustment of the social costs, able to regulate better the international trade among heterogeneous zones, without thus *privarnos of the advantages of the *librecambio.
It is convenient, in particular, that the employees #can put in *entredicho the own foundation of these dismissals and his character of need economic, before his execution and in a very previous stage of the procedure.
The restructuring and the transfer of companies -in particular, of multinationals- in #all *Europa has caused *decenas of thousands of dismissals, unacceptable and condemnable situation by the grave economic consequences and social for the workers, the region and the country affected.
Cases like the of *Michelin in *Francia and *Renault, *Grundig, *Siemens and *Texas *Instruments, #among others, in *Portugal have taken to see clearly that it is urgent to strengthen the #european legislation and of the States members to protect the rights of the workers, in particular his employment, and prevent that the multinationals follow acting of arbitrary form, only to achieve increase his benefits.
The reason of the postponement is that, owing to the delay registered in the works of normalisation of the European Committee of Normalisation, the prescriptions *RID of 1999 do not include norms for the manufacture and use of containers and *cisternas of transport of gases of the class *segunda.
Like this the things, #can not but concede our full support to the report of the speaker, the president of our commission, to the time that *le give the graces by the efforts that has had to make.
I want to, finally, take a brief reflection to the thread of it that has said the Mr. *Konrad with regard to the capacity of the transport by railway and to the stake that is taking  by the railway in the Commission and in the States members.
This increase goes to be the result of an increase of the development and of the growth in our countries and, somehow, #if it did not produce , #would give bad indications with regard to other behaviours of our economy and, therefore, also of our society.
#Segundo Point of reflection: the past day 26, the Mr. Commissioner *Fischler -according to #news of diverse media of my country- seems that it showed  had to contemplate additional #granting in the import of fruits and pertinent vegetables of *Marruecos in the negotiation of the Agreement of fishing.
Again, as in September of 1998, the fight is directed to the #obtaining of freedom, of the elementary social rights, of holidays paid, of social security, of the retirement to the 55 years and of the guarantee of a minimum income.
The Speaker and the Vice-president #would have to take accurate note of #this and treat with the services of the House the need that it establish  a reasonable lapse among the vote and the headcount of the votes.
*Me Seems that the decision of the European Commission to raise the embargo is more political that scientific, #such as they manifest it the divergences of #analysis and of points of sight in the breast of the Scientific Committee European.
#This is an essential point that has to include of urgency in the agenda of the next Conference *Intergubernamental and, like corollary, a point that has to be *imperativamente renegotiated in the frame of the *OMC, of it contrary #all application of the subsidiariness to #european level will have the possibility to be deformed.
It did not leaves to be true that the conditions of the slaughtering with a special gun causes that the cerebral or lymphatic particles happen to the vein *yugular and of there to the muscular mass.
To this effect, the #french Government has created the French Agency of Alimentary Sanitary Security to make a better scientific evaluation of the alimentary risks.
Like this, it is of an absolute hypocrisy invoke to the agriculturalists and his interests and *oponerlos, explicit or implicitly, to the interests of the consumers, without reporting the responsibility of the great capitalist groups producers and providers of foods for the livestock.
The scientist of the region sustained that the subsoil was it sufficiently solid. The scientist of the municipality that denied  to approve the location of the dump *refutaba that the subsoil was equal of solid that a bath without cap.
The solution to this problem did not consists in the creation of an army of civil servants to the service of the EU to watch the activity of the exploitations ranchers.
By #another, exists the need to protect to the consumers that is #one of the maximum priorities and #whose scope is #such that justifies the national decisions that contradict the community, on condition that they are motivated from the point of sight scientific and hygienic-sanitary.
I have taken out fundamentally the following conclusions. In the first place I am fully convinced that the decisions that take from now on, also the of the Commission, have to base in the trial of scientists independent -is important that are independent- and in the scientific discoveries more recent.
In my career of *europarlamentario, brief but full of incidents, and especially after the day of yesterday, have warned in this Assembly -that  *atreve to *autodenominarse "Parliament" - a wish to act like a seal of rubber for the Commission, and once again today seat that #that is our paper.
And, therefore, I consider important that #can consider  this agreement, in addition to an economic benefit for an activity of our country, a help to the development of an economic sector and to the consolidation of the peace in *Angola.
But we wanted to remember, gentleman President, that among the word "exploitation" and the word "cooperation", in spite of that have #the same desinence, there #be a difference and that the *segunda of *ellas corresponds to a situation in that the two parts agree, by it that *nosotros do not believe that *Angola see in east agree type #any of exploitation; of it contrary, #would not sign it the following day to the of his conclusion.
This bulletin is *excepcionalmente useful, gets to *emisoras regional, gives to know, in #all the tongues, the activity of the deputies that talk #such tongue or that proceed of #such nationality, therefore it is *algo that *nosotros, the ancient deputies and the previous European Parliament, know very well and are very sensitive to this *respecto.
Gentleman Commissioner, how explains *usted that here, during seven years, from September of 1989 to March of 1996, two deputies -the #belgian socialist #José *Happart and *yo- said that there was risk of *zoonosis before the Minister of Agriculture #british recognised it on 24 March 1996 in front of the House of the Common?
The Mrs. #Jackson *le has asked, it first, #if the existence of another committee so that it examine our alimentary security in #all the European Union will be better, in reality, that the current permanent committee and #if the citizens *le will loan, in reality, attention.
The European Council of *Helsinki will receive the report of the Council *ECOFIN on the development of the coordination of the economic politics. Said report will promote this dialogue and the reflection on the subject.
The Pact by the Employment in *Europa, adopted the summer happened in the Council of Colony by initiative of *Alemania, is an initiative that will promote the mutual understanding and the renewal of the #european economies.
It is to say, what more facilitate  the goal of stability of the monetary politics by means of budgetary measures and an evolution *salarial suitable, more favourable will be the monetary conditions to the growth and to the employment.
During these two days go to debate the Report *Smet on the ordination of the time of work and the Reports *Menrad on the politics of employment of the States members in the years 1999 and 2000.
Gentleman President, the Council adopted the European Pact by the Employment in the Summit of Colony with the object to reach a substantial decrease and sustained of the unemployment.
This world knows  in the Low Countries like the economy of consensus, a circuit of queries frequent and quite structured among the main socioeconomic actors.
It is necessary that tomorrow approve the position proposed by the speakers and by the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects and say to the Council that has to accept at last this question and watch by that nobody have to work with the inhuman labour days that assign to our doctors in period of training.
In #some countries of the European Union, among *ellos the Low Countries, *Bélgica and *Finlandia, the employers of the transport by road have *independizadas, by like this say, his tyres, #this is, the trucks and drivers, in the frame of a strategy of adjudication or *flexibilización.
#This see it on a large scale in the fight that keeps  in the World-wide Organisation of Trade to reach new commitments and, in a small way, in the fight that exists in the States members of the European Union concerning the ordination of the time of work.
It is not casual that the exceptions refer  in his greater part to the mobile workers and to the persons that wins  the bread in the sea, with the fishing or with the extraction of oil.
*Yo Have my doubts that the publication of the data on the consumption and the broadcasts fulfil a decisive orientative function regarding the decisions of purchase of the consumers.
It exists a difference among the case of the person that goes to buy a medicine to the pharmacy and there *le inform in detail on the risks, and the acquisition of a common article in the market.
Neither it considers  the planned procedure for the participation of the European Parliament in the process so that his rights remain fully guaranteed, neither mentions  the narrow temporary corset that supposes the called annual cycle that foresees  apply.
The mutual recognition is a principle that had his importance to avert fetters to the free circulation of commodities, but only is partially valid for the construction of the inner market in absence of harmonisation of the legislations.
Of this luck the preparation of the guidelines #can include also the results of a comparison of the best methods in each #one of the States members, to end to be able to apply like this in #all the #european field successful strategies.
To my mood to see, in addition to the professional training, exists another important possibility in the deliberate reduction of the fiscal charges in those fields that of provable way are generating put of work.
*Ello Nevertheless, estimated colleagues, believe that in spite of #all have given another small step advance because, as it already has said the speaker, has been the first time that the Council has requested the *dictamen of the Parliament of form official.
The increasing presence of the economy in our society and the introduction of the principle of market in practically #all the social fields are two factors that prejudice to the family and put under pressure to the humanity.
In effect, never will insist  it sufficient in that they are these politics *ultraliberales in the interior and *ultramundialistas in the outside and his cult to the opening of the borders and to the market-king the that have carried to our economies to the point in the that they find  nowadays.
As Conservative British share the worry that has expressed  from #all the parts of this Assembly that the high level of unemployment in the EU in his group is #one of the main problems and that the goal has to be an important descent of #the same.
Without embargo, neither the balance, neither the establishment of goals exempt to the States members and to the social speakers of his main responsibility on the politics of employment in his countries, since #that are specific.
It do not treats , as #some fear, to give a to scale #european recipe, but to establish a series of instruments that sure enough allow to reach the result to create employment and social cohesion.
Although the main responsibility of the project *recae of course on the States members, #would be politically impossible to carry out a so wide reform in the only market without a coordination to scale of the Union.
This European Parliament supports aptly in our amendment 13 the integral approach, #as well as the development of goals comparable to the that *me will refer inside a moment and for the that ask the support of #all in this Parliament.
The European Union has 20 millions of unemployed and with 60 millions of poor and there #be not in the guidelines any measure *vinculante directed to prevent the dismissals and the plans of reduction of staff.
I consider that the turn of questions constitutes an elementary parliamentary right that, in contrast with other points of the agenda is guaranteed also on purpose in the Treaties, and, in consequence, wanted to insist in that the turn of questions make  in his whole.
Gentleman President, *cuando the European Parliament in the autumn of 1998 agreed the continuation of the Program Car-*Oil, the calendar foresaw that the subject #would go back to the Parliament to time to make possible a decision of the Council in the spring of 1999.
Personally, I believe that the Council foresees in his common position #all a series of disposals very important as, for example, the reduction of the values limit for the dioxide of carbon in a 30% in comparison with 1996 from October of the year 2000 or of the 2001.
Without embargo, #can accept the definition of the World-wide Organisation of the Health, in the that says  that the health is not only the absence of illnesses, but a state of welfare physical, mental and social.
In January adopted  a conjoint decision in the that established  a plan of action to promote the safest use of Internet and, therefore, to protect to the boys of the violence and of the pornography.
The Commission, likewise, undertakes actions in the social and educational fields with the idea to improve the quality of life of the boys and the opportunities for his development and education.
We are in an absurd situation in the that the States members have to promote it that it is better for the boys in the legislation and in the politics, but in the Union do not exists a legal obligation to protect it that it was better for the boys.
And while all #this *sucede in the world in roads of development, in the Occident, purportedly civilised, the violence, the abandonment and the sexual exploitation of the boys, by means of the international networks, are taking hair-raising dimensions.
In the period of sessions of the past month, *usted, lady Commissioner, *calurosa and convincingly affirmed that it is will of the Commission strengthen the rights of the employees regarding the information and the query on his destination.
Finally, Gentleman President, the Commission of Control Budgetary thinks that *nosotros also to the half of #the same term have to go back to study a new system of own resources, because #if it goes to have more countries the current system #can result too much complicated.
The agreements of *Berlín are a combination among the total level and the composition of the cost, the political reforms and the system of resources own.
In *Berlín, admit, in effect, the principle according to the *cual #some rich countries, the of the north of the Union, paid too much, of there a new weighting of the proportional parts of finance of the States members that will have like consequence a greater participation of *Francia by a quantity of the order of varied thousands of millions of frank.
Only a new approach of the question of the own resources, that do not increase the fiscal charge borne by the taxpayers and that go back more transparent, simple and rational the system #can give conditions of affirmation to the European Union.
The only real justification of #such aberration is to recess the #dutch bill, although the balance -to use the terminology of the Council- goes inflated in favour of the arks *bátavas by the effect *Rotterdam.
*Acaso Thinks  that we #can continue long with a tax *conributiva so limited *cuando the European Union purchases every time a greater number of responsibilities related with the *prolongamiento of the monetary union, the enlargement of the Union, the take into account the foreign political responsibilities and of security?
In the practice, this ceiling depends of the agreement among the organs, that results clearly inferior to the of the politics of costs of agriculture #This is another clear indication of the parliamentary responsibility in relation to the budgets.
With regard to the *PRS 5 *permítanme that *me direct also to the Commission for *decirle that of course knew that we were a new Parliament and in spite of *ello presented in the holidays of summer a supplementary budget *cuando were not at all in situation to react because the new Parliament was not still operative.
In consequence, the committee of the Commission commissioned of the nomination has made a selection and *les #can ensure that today  *les will deliver in the course of the day the list of candidates that has been elaborated by this last committee.
*Me Allow to observe that it is a budgetary political reality that in the course of an exercise, of the execution of a budget, arise events that do not allow a total utilisation of #all the budgetary lines.
I want to retort to the Mrs. *Dührkop *Dührkop that, of course, the priorities that this Parliament determine in the budgetary procedure and for the budget in #if, are scales that has to follow the Commission when acting in the frame of the execution of the budget.
My parliamentary Group takes a call to the Commission and to the States members so that they introduce said tax of form coordinated so that there #be not disloyal competition inside the Union; this tax, of course, do not has to *repercutir in our citizens.
We #can not *hacernos charge of the nuclear waste, in spite of that have proposed  diverse imaginative solutions, included the of *enviarlos to the Moon, and the truth is that, #if we suited with the Mr. *Chichester in that the nuclear energy is a solution, #would be in another planet.
The communication of the Commission on the strengthening of the environmental integration in the community energetic politics is very #worthy of *beneplácito, given his realistic approach of the question.
#This supposes -taking into account the point of sight environmental in his owed form- that the States members prepare his own national strategies -since it is a question of decisions of national type- with sufficient time for the replacement and *recolocación of investments.
*Yo Was not favourable to the approval of the amendments subjected to the vote of our Assembly, that had delayed the entrance in vigour of this text and, therefore, the set up of the investments and the industrial strategies.
My Group will go back to present some amendments that presented  in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market to try advance more still, so that the systems that go to establish result more accessible and opened for the professionals.
The own speakers check the so marked differences in matter of right of the persons among the States members, it that explains the strong reservations formulated in the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens.
Another point: to me also *me has got this study of the Institute for the Analysis of Risks of the Senate of the university of *Viena that analyses the question of *Yaslovske *Bohunice under a different perspective.
Only *Europa and, gentleman Commissioner, *le appreciate that it have comprised it, only #one *Europa joined #can go to the meeting, no only of the countries that ask to go in in the European Community, but also of #all #that that have of nuclear facilities no satisfied with our norms of security for *ayudarles to resolve the problem taking into account his own imperative economic.
*Usted Has indicated with reason that owe *tomarnos seriously the scientific considerations and childbirth of the fact that the #british graziers are interested in selling it more quickly possible a safe meat and not expecting two years until they #can take it.
I believe that His *Señoría #would consider wise on our part have taken part in the mission of evaluation of the World-wide Bank and expect to that our civil servants, that have taken part in said mission of evaluation, present his reports before resorting to the budgetary authorities for *pedirles concrete quantities of bottoms.
Of #the same mood, the company "*Mitilinaios *S.To.", with upper investments to 52 millions of dollars in the mines "*RMHK *TREPCA", face up to objections and difficulties and suffer pressures, with the last purpose to cancel his contractual and real rights in the mines quoted.
The *KFOR is taking all it possible in circumstances extraordinarily difficult and deserves #all our support to try, for example, watch by that there #be not a repetition of the type of atrocity against both edicts that, by misfortune, has *desbaratado the life in *Kosovo in the past.
They exist diverse modalities of finance in the national levels and of the EU -#such as the structural Bottoms and the *agromedioambientales- and #can use  to help in the reconversion and in the management of his social repercussions during a transitory period.
The report of the EU will exert an important influence in the development of the sources of resources regional, and thus it #can not arise a split among the old and the new programs.
Simply I want to say that in these cases, will show pragmatism to be able to adapt, according to the demands of the national authorities, the programming of the Goal 1 or of the Goal 2 to help to these countries to reconstruct .
How it is  had to take so that the countries that do not contemplate in his legislations the prohibition to exert violence against the women in the breast of the home also have these norms?
#One of the essential elements of the communication of the Commission is precisely the ratification by #all the States members of the Agreement of the Council of *Europa of 1983 and #can inform to His *Señoría that the quoted agreement was ratified by *Alemania, *Dinamarca, *Finlandia, *Francia, *Luxemburgo, the Low Countries, the Realm Joined and *Suecia.
But no only #this #would be necessary, but also promote a dialogue with the main actors, no only aerial companies and users, but also with the aerial controllers and #all the airports, etc. Is to say, #all those actors that take part inside this complex world of the aerial traffic.
The Monday, in the Council of Subjects General, the ministers left very clear that had political will to decide in *Helsinki on #which has to be the collective military capacity of *Europa for the missions of *Petersberg.
It is evident that the Commission is not a school of fans to bosses of personnel and is evident that want to work by the hit with the High Representative and with the Parliament to guarantee that *Europa has the politics of security and of defence that needs and that his citizens want.
Since it has referred  at length to his responsibility like High Representative for the External Politics, #would want to mention a look that believe that it is important: our external politics and of common security will be, fundamentally, a projection and a development of our inner strength.
Equally, it do not extract like only lesson of this terrible experience the requirement to be able to range more troops, to be able to increase our military costs and to advance by forced marches to the *Europa of the defence, besides, in the frame of the NATO.
Thus I request to the Commission that inform to the Parliament with character of urgency on the relative conversations to the adhesion of Chinese and, in particular, of how #this #can affect to our *preparativos bear *Seattle, so that the Parliament #can vote tomorrow the report of the Mr. *Schwaiger with full knowledge of #all the notable data.
Therefore, I repeat, #if the regulation of the world-wide trade is destroying the means of life of the persons and damaging the environment or the protection of the animals, have to modify the regulation.
. (*FR) The proposal of regulation of the Council of Ministers, on the that *nos pronounce in the day of today, pretends to contribute #some modifications that the decision of the European Council of Bosses of State and of Government of the month of March in *Berlín has taken necessary.
Gentleman President, gentleman Representative of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, so much my colleagues like *yo same have received with relief the day before yesterday the statement of the Council of Subjects External of the Union that condemns *vigorosamente the disproportionate use and *indiscriminado that takes  of the strength in *Chechenia.
Also we were #many the that regret, with a majority of the #european public opinion, the contrast *sobrecogedor among the *estruendo of the bombardments and the prolonged silence of the governments of the European Union.
In spite of his own moral ballast, the European Union has to act with #all his strengths so that it get  to a solution of the crisis of *Chechenia following the guidelines that the Council and the Commission have exposed here.
The European Union asks an exit negotiated -and joyous #that that believes in the possibility of a negotiation- while in the *Cáucaso the Russians distinguish among the bandits -#that that ask the independence- *cargándoles perhaps of the #islamic colours, and the fine, or was, the that collaborate with *ellos.
In reality, neither has been free trade, since the International Monetary Bottom has endorsed the risks taken by the North American investors and *les has compensated the losses that has originated the free trade of capitals.
The deputies to the European Parliament of the Communist Party of #Grecia will vote against of the Report *Schwaiger, because it ranges  with the plans of aggression of the big capital against the workers and the villages of #everyone.
There are other international treaties, like the celebrated in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of the Work, of the World-wide Organisation of the Intellectual Property and of the agreements *multilaterales in matter of environment.
And, from this point of sight, gentleman President, and to finish, wanted to offer #all our support and our collaboration to the Commissioner *Lamy in the purpose and the points of sight strategic that has very present for *defenderlos in *Seattle.
Without embargo, with the approval of the Report *Schwaiger, the Parliament will decide and will declare tomorrow that the concept of the protection of the environment has to take  in consideration in #all the fields of the world-wide trade, no with an ambiguous disposal, with a "#can" or a "#would have to" , but with "owe" imperative.
The sum of #all these elements *nos carries to recommend a cycle of negotiations wider - and *me cheer of the enormous coincidence of points of sight in this sense among the Commission and the Parliament #such as it deduces , gentleman *Schwaiger, of his report.
In any case have the mandate to admit, in the frame of an international negotiation, the *cuestionamiento of the power of the Governments of the Union to regulate or act in these fields.
. (OF) Gentleman President, the Commission of Subjects Constitutional debated thoroughly this report during varied sessions and *yo believe that today we present to the Plenary a report with a substantial content with seen to the reform of the Treaties.
In the first place, we request the reform of #all the institutions and organs, included, therefore, the Court of Justice, the Court of Accounts, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
In this sense, request that the President of the Commission #can interpose the question of confidence in front of the European Parliament and that incorporate  to the next Treated the called "procedure *Prodi" , or was, the possibility that the President #can *destituir to a commissioner.
Specifically, we ask that it reinforce  the paper of the Parliament and establish  the principle of the vote by majority in the Council in #some fields in the that the Treaties already assign a key paper to *Europa, *salvaguardando fully the principle of subsidiariness.
#This will exert an important paper in the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental, and have to say that backrest with #a lot of taste the general goals fixed in this report on the construction of a more effective Union, more transparent and more democratic.
But #everything *ello, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, taking into account an essential thing: not losing of sight it that have meant the European Communities in these years neither it that it is more important in the Communities, that is the principle of integration.
Gentleman President, #this *CIG will have the support of two parallel processes: "the happy world" of a new politics of #european defence and the definition of the #european citizenship in the preparation of the Letter.
Never we will accept that the executive power in the EU was preparing  now for another governmental conference #whose core was the transfer of the power of the constituents and of his representatives to enclosed offices in *Bruselas.
The *segunda amends analyses the subject that the Treaty state of two parts: the constitutional part, that analyses the fundamental principles and the institutional disposals, and the small letter that treats on the politics.
To succeed, the institutional reforms have to situate, *me seems to me -and say it  with the experience that conserve in the memory of the previous negotiation- in a political perspective wider and try answer joints to this fundamental question: "How we will have to *hablarnos?
In the first place, the institutional reforms #such as they planned  in Colony: the composition of the Commission, a Commissioner by Been member in it that to *nosotros refers ; the weighting of the votes, that has to save proportion with the number of inhabitants; and the votes by qualified majority.
The third question is that we have to establish a fine legal base in the new Treaty for the adoption of a relative #european regulation to the opening of the administration and to the transparency.
I want to say here that reform a treaty in name of the efficiency *me seems an operation of very *poca ambition in front of the #european project and fear that so only was a simple game of power to allow that a small group of countries #can constitute in directory and conduct and direct the #european project.
Besides, it has presented  this appeal with arrangement to the article 112 of our Regulation, that remits to the article 60, *cuando results that the report of the Mr. *Napolitano, as it says  very clearly in the *considerandos of said report, remits to the article 181, because *versa on the inner Regulation of our Parliament.
Besides, in consideration to the national penal right, the efforts for *uniformar the common definitions, the foundations to dictate cars of processing and the penalties, have to limit in a first stage to #some sectors determined of special importance, #such as the illicit market of drugs.
It is to say, that do not treats  to fix in concrete a start of the negotiations, but to ratify the quality of candidate to the adhesion and to consider the measures to take in consequence.
It #can indicate the Council #if these restrictions imposed by *Turquía are compatible with the principles of the European Union and #if it accepts that the interests of the fuselages with pavilion of the States members of the Union result prejudiced by a country that aspires to integrate  in #the same?
*Me Ask also why the European Union shows  so *tolerante with the infringements committed by *Turquía, and accepts that the interests of the Marine *Mercante #european are *lesionados by a country that do not hesitates in looming even to the *superpotencia, the States Joined, to defend the trade of the banana.
The *segunda observation, and question to #the same time, that want to direct to the gentleman representative of the Council is the following: to the diet of *Milosevic do not recognises it the European Union; it says , before even that the own political strengths of *Yugoslavia, of Serbian, pronounce  to the *respecto, that just elections #can not celebrate.
The efforts deployed to reduce the bleaching of money have to intensify by means of the fast adoption and subsequent application of the recently proposed amendment for the directive on the bleaching of money.
By #everything it aforesaid entrust in that have the potential and #can have of the political will to face up to the new challenges in the perspective of the strategy of the European Union in matter of fight against the drug for the years 2000 to 2004.
#If we vote on the original text of this section, #if we finish the vote on the amendment, in this moment will propose that it vote  on the words "*and *socially-*balanced" of the #english text by separate of the rest of the text.
From now on *me #would enjoy to ask to this Group that took the favour to verify how many deputies #can present to individual title amendments in session *plenaria; 15 different deputies of the *PPE have presented amendments of this report, suppose that in name of the Group, before wasting our time in the session *plenaria.
In the current situation, have opted for voting in favour of the whole of the report in the final vote, since vote against #can interpret like that we do not want that it regulate  the fight against the fraud.
The fundamental human rights and the universal Statement of 1948, the agreements of the *OIT (International Organisation of the Work) or on the environment, are of upper nature to the norms that govern the trade.
I ask to the negotiators of the European Union that respect our resolution in favour of the principle of the alimentary security and in favour that it do not have hurtful effects for the countries in development in the agricultural negotiations.
And they result particularly important -and earn particular gravity-, because they are equally evident the orientations that  *les pretend to print: liberalisation and total command of the world-wide trade, systematic privatisation of the sectors and public services that still have this nature and *desreglamentación and free access to the public markets.
Maybe the villages of *Europa that see day to day restrict his democratic and social rights, that see to degrade his social conquests under the lemma of the competitiveness and the pressure, that bear an increasingly authoritarian system?
By the contrary, consider that the creation of *Eurodac has to study to the light of this possibility to reach a politics of asylum human and generous in the European Union.
The measures that today propose, no only to *través of the Report *Pirker, but also through the reports on the drug or the fake of documents of trip, are insignificant in front of the amplitude of the dangers to the *cuales *ustedes expose to the #european citizens.
#If only a part of this network of security leaves to work by digital defects, the core of uranium in the reactor, of roughly 100 tonnes, #would melt  in two hours #if the two generators *diesel of reservation do not work.
The States Joined and *Rusia have established recently #some #telephone lines of emergency to end to keep  in contact about the problems of the year 2000, and the seven lines of emergency that have established, with an alone exception, have discovered that were affected by the effect of the year 2000.
Finally, gentleman President, our intention is the that the Commission and the Council #can take correspond to the convictions and to the political speeches the suitable financial expression and technical of support to the process of independence and reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
Therefore, *me seems that the proposal of the Council in front of the Nations Joined, by important and positive that it was the initiative, is truly shy because it appeals *textualmente to that the States that still keep the pity of death -quote *textualmente- "restrict progressively the number of crimes for the that it imposes " .
Another problem is that the #albanian leaders or the that believe to be it are not able to build jointly a future for this country, for his homeland. Therefore, it is important that also take a call to the supposed leaders.
Therefore, it is indispensable that the mission of the EU in *Moscú at least examine this case. But also it is important that take part in the dialogue from a point of sight political, that recognise  the character merely politician of the process and that #Alexander *Nikitin was put in freedom.
*Nosotros Already are acting in this way, without #a lot of hit, alas, from before the conflict - and share, from this point of sight it that #many of *ustedes have signalled on the fact that #all have to take an examination of consciousness quite deep in this question -.
The Commission is considering, with the other providers of bottoms, the opportunity and the procedures to contribute to the instauration of this system, in the frame of our cooperation.
In a meeting kept in New *York at the beginning of this year, the providers of bottoms of *Burundi decided to contribute to the improvement of the conditions of life of the most vulnerable populations and orient his support to the *reasentamiento of the populations displaced.
In the frame of these takings of position, the Commission has approved a program of rehabilitation of almost 50 millions of euros, that will be able to apply in function of the conditions of security of this country.
(IN) The Convention on the Rights of the Boy is the convention of right international that more hit has had, and the have signed #all the countries of the world except *Somalia and the States Joined of *América.
Because the mood and way to help to this person affected to go back to the society, the mood and way to reduce his personal suffering will nourish  always of the regional experiences, local and national specific.
In definite, prevent a true scientific debate and secular on this subject and choose an ethical approach that  self-evident *frustrante, powerless and disastrous: a disaster that treat to justify with the fault of resources financial.
On 26 October happened in this same Assembly the President of *Colombia, country alas very linked to the problem of the drug, *nos said: "The drug trafficking has been a big generator of violence and has committed *magnicidios of very high human cost for our nation" .
This decision supposes in fact an enormous victory for the European Parliament and thus I want to say that for me has been reason of joy lead this fight, now my colleague goes to assume this responsibility and am totally sure that *le go to adore in the bank.
For *ello, is necessary an authentic "political will strong and expressed without ambiguity", is necessary to happen of the words to the acts, *movilizando the community financial resources necessary to struggle against this dramatic situation that affects to thousands of *toxicodependientes and to his families.
Precisely it was the Protocol *nº 2, to the that before *me have referred, the that, adjusting to the new legislation the that had been traditional formulas, established the called "*APIM" , a modest tariff with the that they tax  determined products to his entrance in Canarians, #many of *ellos pertinent of the own peninsular territory Spanish and other got of other States.
This same week, the autonomic Parliament of Canarians, with occasion of a political debate on this question, has approved by unanimity an agreement in the that they include  measured in fiscal matter and requests  to *Europa that foresee the establishment of a similar tax to the *APIM.
Here it is my *segunda asks: #if my information is correct, a part of the wage of the workers commissioned of the construction of said fuselages will be paid by the Armed American, with the end to preserve the capacity of the naval constructions.
The consequence will be that the fine dockyards - that they are many times the most efficient - *sucumbirán along the period 2001-2002. With the less efficient dockyards that remain afterwards in the European Union will be much more difficult to struggle against *Japón, the *sureste of #Asia and the States Joined.
As it left  clear also in the meeting of Ministers of Industry and of Trade of *Finlandia, the EU do not has to, without embargo, answer with #the same coin to the activity of *Corea of the South, is to say, follow posing once again the idea that neither it will put  end to the helps to the dockyards.
Specifically, in my country, the past Wednesday had demonstrations of workers in #all the centres dockyards -*Bilbao, *Cádiz, Real Port, *Sevilla and *Asturias- besides with a level of violence important, because we are looming the life and security of #a lot of millions of homes.
*Señorías, the inform that the Court of First Instance of the European Communities dictated on 25 November a resolution that, in relation with the case that *oponía to the deputies Mr. *Martinez and Mr. Of *Gaulle to the European Parliament, puts end for the moment the procedure of resource that also *incoaron said colleagues.
By #this the process of adhesion has to be fast but careful and, on my part, expect that the Summit of *Helsinki approve the strategy for the adhesion that recommend in October and take the decision to initiate the next year, always that they fulfil  the planned conditions, negotiations of adhesion with *Bulgaria, *Letonia, *Lituania, Malt, *Rumanía and *Eslovaquia.
#This show  very concerned by the #russian performance in *Chechenia. By #this, is a suitable signal that do not begin to negotiate only with *Estonia, but also with *Letonia and *Lituania, so as to that the three States *bálticos know that have a place in our Community and that early will be members of the European Union and, therefore, will be safe.
The European Union and the States members constitute together the main group of donors with that explains the zone and apart from the humanitarian help, the region has received this year helps of the EU by value of 2.100 millions of euros.

My inaugural intervention in front of this Assembly was the past month of July, and in that occasion recommended to the #finnish Presidency that gave priority to the society of the information and to his program of work.
Regarding the question of the #gipsy that has posed  here, wanted to say, on my part, that believe that it is pertinent to take in account the human rights in general and, especially, the rights of the minorities so much in the European Union as, especially, in the aspiring countries to the adhesion.
The Commission engaged  to take the next step, or was, to design a plan of action, so we have achieved our expensive goal to the period of the #portuguese Presidency.
#If we achieved that neither the governments neither individual companies #can put price to the solidarity of the community of States democratic to change of the conclusion of an agreement, said Governments neither #would have the opportunity of *contraponer a thing to the #another.
Said application #would have to cover three important looks: the follow-up of the situation of the human rights, the fulfillment of the human rights and the structures of the politics in matter of human rights.
#If the European Council takes #his this proposal, from the point of sight of *Turquía *ello #would seat the base for a dialogue again type with the European Union, as *Ankara #can explain then with the perspective of a future adhesion.
There it signals in two occasions that, at least regarding the problem *kurdo, do not observe  perceivable progresses and, quote, that to the sight of the strengthening of the party *ultranacionalista *MHP -is the terminology that employs the Commission- also considers and evaluates like doubtful the possibilities of future progresses.
Gentleman Commissioner, in fact also want *felicitarle -precisely because they have listened  #some critical comments against the Commission- and congratulate especially also to his collaborators and collaborators, that find  here and that have worked with big dedication in this question and have kept in #all moment a fine communication and a dialogue with the Parliament.
#All know that the problem of the reduction of the presence of substances harmful in the air acclimatise is very urgent, also from the point of sight of the climatic change.
The Commission #can accept this part of the amendment 7 that #would add to the list of means to the that they #can resort the States members to inform to the public opinion on the quality of the air.
The European Parliament approved on 4 November of this year, in *segunda reading, the directive on information to the consumers, and therefore  the #can consider as approved in accordance with the principles of the common position; there #be not, in sum, reasons to argue this subject again.
Precisely, because of the regrettable taken that the ministers were so joined, so anxious to keep narrow relations far of the scrutiny to #european level, now have this process that comes to introduce transparency and clarity and that definitely *infundirá confidence to the #european society.
The wood is the home of the biological diversity, an important cheat for the dioxide of carbon and, maybe, the main regulatory of the climate and of the water in the earth.

This Parliament supported without objections the process of peace of *Irlanda of the North, and *yo also give the *enhorabuena, of #all heart, to the #irish village and to #all the citizens of the Realm Joined by his hit.
Gentleman President, finish saying that the boys of my generation, during 40 years, hear *machaconamente a speech that said that the best destination of the urns was to be destroyed and that it was necessary to substitute the dialectics of the words by the of the fists and the guns.
 *me Had informed that the Commissioner was already engaged with a meeting of the central banks and that, to the *enterarse that this debate went to celebrate  to #the same hour, has preferred to opt for being today here, in the Parliament.
*cuarta: Campaigns of information of intensity in increase until 2002, in particular for the most vulnerable groups, by means of a systematic action in the system of education, of the *ONG and of the means of information in general, especially the television in main schedule, newscasts and sportive programs of big audience;
In this sense -already have debated it in the Commission of Subjects Economic but go back to make the offer-, am had to that *nos set up to see how resolve of form more efficient the problems of communication among #one and #others.
There was in the proposal of the varied Commission products of the that there #be community production and important community production, as it seems to be showing the study that, to instances of the Council and place that the figures of the Commission *carecían of justification, is elaborating .
A new segment of market in the field of the breeding of animals, that with an effective management guarantees a greater stability of the offer and of the planning, that the fishing do not reaches never.
In second term, regarding the relative questions to the withdrawal and to the destruction, fixes  a price of reference, a price of orientation, and award  compensations in case that the products of the fishing do not sell .
Likewise, the procurement of the banks in coins and notes has to begin a lot before the month of January of 2002, and the procurement of the retail dealers and of the public administrations has to initiate at the beginning of the month of December of 2001.
The last meeting of the Council in the present year will be the Thursday and, #if the Assembly wishes it and gives his compliance, *me #would enjoy to propose formally that instead of a debate, celebrate a vote on the report the Wednesday.
We owe *preocuparnos by the repercussions of said liberalisation in the main parameters of our models of development: fundamental rights of the workers, protection of the environment and of the health, cultural diversity, *multifuncionalidad of the agriculture, quality of the environment.
The bilateral summit in the that *nos gather this week *nos will allow to verify #if it is a signal of flexibility or #if it treats  so only of the repetition of the #american positions known in *pro of a round limited to the access to the market.
And the *segunda to say that it #would be very useful -as it has said the Mr. #James *Elles- a conjoint work with the States Joined to clear the positions of both parts and can like this facilitate a future understanding.
#If we take the example of the #european agriculture, #can not follow saying that it goes well, that is *multifuncional, that works of positive form, that from now defends to his consumers and to #the same time keeps a selfish posture bear with the countries of the South.
It That *nos poses clearly a more difficult problem is that the States Joined have -as have- an environmental program less ambitious that the #ours, as, #if neither the countries in roads of development neither the Americans support our program, *nos will result very difficult to take it advance.
#Some have said that the Parliament has to be the first in receiving the material that produces the Court of Accounts, already was our annual report or the special reports that elaborate during #all the year.
But it true in this case is that the Court of Accounts has discovered to the responsible of the leaks of the annual report to the press and has taken the timely measures.
I agree with *él regarding the need of our work to guarantee to the taxpayers that takes  a good use of his money, and underline likewise, as it has taken the Mrs. go *der *Laan, the need that also the States members struggle against the fraud.
The pluralism in the culture and in the mood to contemplate the favourable world increasingly the reciprocal understanding and, like this, a greater knowledge on the #another and the exchange of information.
Gentleman President, to begin, wanted to hail to the Mrs. *Pack and to the delegation of the Parliament in the Committee of Conciliation by the efforts that have devoted to guarantee the best agreement on the *segunda stage of the program *SOCRATES.
*Permítanme, *Señorías, that *les ask help so that together achieve to build bridges among the systems of education of our nations and among the #ours and the systems of other nations so that, in greater number that in the past, the youngsters #can cross these bridges and engage  with the *Europa of the knowledge.
The Commission has presented a proposal by the that move  the recommendations of the *NEAFC to the community legislation, that by means of the simplification and the coherence incorporates #all the experiences accumulated of the *NAFO and adapts  to the previous position of the Parliament.
In spite of the reservations and the previously mentioned criticisms regarding the moment of the presentation of the proposal of the Commission, this important legislative piece has to be approved immediately by the Parliament.
Memory that the Commissioner *Fischler declared during his audition in front of the Commission of Fishing on 30 August that proposed  cooperate closely with the Parliament and with the permanent committees of the Parliament in an active collaboration.
In the case of the Big Duchy of *Luxemburgo produced  a delay in the nomination of the elect candidates due to the fact that the elections to the European Parliament took place simultaneously with the elections to the Parliament *luxemburgués.
Therefore, gentleman President, east is the curtain of bottom of the report that tomorrow will be voted in the Plenary of the Parliament and to the that, like speaker, have presented two amendments that justify  with it that have explained on the elections in *Luxemburgo and with the words that have pronounced.
It wanted to *recordarles, so much to the Commission as to the Council, a beautiful sentence of a #german jurist of the past century. #This said that the legislator has to think like a philosopher and talk like a peasant, simple and clearly and comprehensible for the persons.
But without forgetting that these modifications constitute an explanation in some mood *ociosa -and has reason the Mr. *Rothley-, because a directive in any case #can affect to the international Right deprived neither to the rules of procedure.
#If to #this add an international dimension in the that the victims find  in a foreign country, the problems #can multiply: languages and different procedures, inability to identify or locate to third, by not talking of the formalities with the insurance companies.
I have to remember that this number is very small, *equivale to two daily trips for each country, and that the sum of #all these permissions of attribution automatic along the five years do not reaches at least the 7% of the total.
To *través of #the same the European Union establishes the forms and the terms for the progressive elimination of the substances that exhaust the coat of ozone and *le ensure that no *subestimo at all the dangerousness of the current situation.
*Ello Nevertheless, the report of the Mrs. *Hulthén goes back to propose the amendments that were not approved shortening indiscriminately the calendar for the prohibitions of the production, the commercialisation and the use of the distinct substances.
In the actuality is indispensable this labeling by two reasons, first because they do not know  exactly the dangers for the public health that proceed of alimentary products produced from *OGM or his derivatives and consistently is reasonable to follow of wall his path in the market.
Of #the same mood, invites  to the Commission to that it prepare a proposal on a long-term basis that it integrate closely the politics for the sustainable development from the point of sight economic, social and ecological, the *cual will have to present to the European Council in June of the 2002.
It has been a première in style, because it has been able, in a historical moment, loaded of signs, of face to the new #millenium, to aim a creative perspective for the European Union in front of the challenges to the that it confronts .
My Group, by mediation of this Assembly, will work together with other deputies and together with the Commission to try convince to the next #portuguese Presidency so that it was more ambitious in the reform, without thus leave to respect the calendar.
We have to expect that there #be a village that  *atreva to say no to the penultimate treaty before the Constitution and believes the broth of crop so that the unification and the centralism are substituted by the *Europa of the democracies and of the diversity.
Among the disappointments find  again some important questions from the point of sight of the development of the internal market and of the system of taking of decisions of the Union.
Regarding the question of #if they will attend here the Ministers of Defence, neither #can answer negatively, but it is necessary to take into account that the Council of Subjects General commissions  of these questions and, #if it is necessary, will take part in #the same the Ministers of Defence.
And *nosotros know that #that is the essential problem, because it is a problem related with the nature of the European Parliament, because it do not treats  of a Parliament that work with the normal constitutional systems of our countries.
To our opinion, the best alternative is a road differentiated: cooperation in matter of security, development of the Union *Aduanera, permanent political dialogue, instead of *promulgar a statute of candidate to the adhesion that in last instance *carece of #all value and that will contribute rather to create problems that to his solution.
The decisions of *Helsinki are of a big transcendence for the future of the Union, specifically, the decisions on the strategy for the enlargement, on the Conference *Intergubernamental and on the External Politics and of Common Security.
They will fund  new programs: in the agricultural sector, of help for infrastructures and in the fields of the transport and the protection of the environment. #This will allow to pipe to the States candidates by the path of the approximation to the Union in important looks.
Said #this, *yo want to manifest my gratitude to the speakers, Gentlemen *Bourlanges, *Virrankoski and *Colom -although his report do not debate  today-, and especially also to the president and to the members of the Commission of Budgets by the intense work that have developed during the last months.
The budgetary games for the Commission of Environment refer  in general to quantities very small, but *nos have allowed to initiate the preparatory investigation that *nos will help to formulate the question of the competition in matter of health according to the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
The Roman President *Prodi has expressed the position of the Commission on the interpretation of the decisions of *Helsinki today in the morning here, in front of the Plenary, and to this statement remit regarding the position of the Commission.
Gentleman President, in the audition of the Commissioner Mr. *Vitorino, *le said that had the joy to see that it was the only Commissioner that had concerned  to talk of the education like *algo important to incorporate to the *tercer *pilar.
In opinion of the Commission, the Letter that will present  to the Bosses of State and of Government has to contribute an authentic value added and the better form to reach it is to centre in the resultant fundamental rights of the own Union.
#This do not involves that the rail transport do not have #a lot of advantages in the long distances, since, with #all security, - and *eso also concerns a lot to the Mr. *Messner - the surroundings, the environment, suffers less damage.
The current committee of work has shown to be an important forum for the debate and for the exchange of information and experiences on the politics of quality among the States members and the countries candidates.
I create -after an investigation carried out during 18 months by a newspaper of the Realm Joined, as a result of the investigation of the Commission- that the time constrains and the car industry want to now find a solution for this question.
By a part, kept an attitude too much *vacilante in relation with the formal statement of the Agreement *Interinstitucional and contracted international commitments of character *plurianual, but instead in a *primer moment manifested the intention to resolve only, like a *primer step, the problem of finance for the year 2000.
Therefore, *nos have pronounced in favour of a reasonable review of the financial perspectives for varied years, and the proposal of our general speaker, gentleman *Bourlanges, that asked a review like this for the chapter 4, went in the correct direction.
Therefore, we #would have to initiate serious negotiations in the budgetary look and the Council #can congratulate that the European Parliament was to the height of his responsibilities in relation with these budgetary subjects and also have  *politizado in this look.
The *margen financial necessary for *ello #can establish  in the frame of the decisions of the European Union, specifically conceding greater importance to the exhaustion of the maximum limit of the own resources in function of the gross inner product.
The sense of our rejection to vote the Report *Bourlanges is to #the same time the to report the character limited and *irrisorio of the help considered, but also and especially report the politics of the western powers in the *Balcanes.
The Commission values the efforts made by the Parliament and in particular by the speaker and by the Commission of Budgets, and also the efforts that has made the #finnish Presidency of the Council.
#All the future challenges -the enlargement, the competitiveness in the international transactions, the level *persistentemente high of unemployment- are related with the financial subject. The Court of Accounts #can modify, besides, his committed in this look.
Therefore, it keeps  in foot the call to the States members so that they also designate women for this task, as sure that among so much even in *Europa will have run the voice that the women know of accounts; the value to signal the deficiencies have had it always.
The paper of the Court of Accounts consists in examining #all the income and the costs to see #if the costs have been legal and normal and #if the financial management has been serious.
Finally, *me #would enjoy to ask to the representative of the European Commission, so much with regard to this last point mentioned as to the report in general, #if it goes to have really in account the recommendations formulated in the frame of this query, a time approved by our Parliament.
In previous years, *me have seen forced to ascertain, to the equal that #many other active colleagues in *Europa Oriental, that the utilisation of the bottoms of the EU in the frame of *TACIS no always was the most effective.
Gentleman *Valdivielso -expect that it treat  of a misunderstanding because of an error of the translation-, *yo believe that the continuity of the project *TACIS in favour of the democracy is very important precisely in *Rusia and that it is precise to select with #a lot of care the fields in the that sure enough it #would have to  suspend the program *TACIS.
In *tercer place, in my opinion, the help #would have to direct, in greater measure that until today -and am thinking now, for example, in the granting of money, that has *carecido of a clear direction and of control during long time-, instead of to *Moscú, to the common citizen, to the most disadvantaged Russians.
And I finish underlining that the *dictamen satisfied on this recommendation will allow to the European Community adhere fully to the Parallel Agreement and confirm his position of leader in the harmonisation and in the politics of enlargement of the markets.
Also *nosotros coincide with the Council in the sense to tend bridges to the countries in development. But tend bridges to the countries in development means two things: not trying trade with *ellos the purchase-sale of quotas and no *recortar neither the bottoms of development and of help so that they #can take measures in the direction that *nosotros pose.
The question of the climatic changes and the corresponding apocalyptic visions are a forceful way, world-wide, to call the attention on the dangers of the pollution.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, *Señorías; *Kioto, certainly, is #one of the great challenges of the century *XXI. But the way to solve the problem of the climatic change #can be also very significant of the civilisation of the future.
*Yo Do not want to take part, by means of the approval of a proposal of taxes community on the energy, in the implantation of a principle that limit the sovereignty of the States members in fiscal matter.
The behaviour of each #one of *nosotros, the consumers, has consequences in the climate, and the energetic tax, a tax on the dioxide of carbon, is a method so that the price convert  in ecological label.
*Nos Concerns can express our opinion *cuando believe that they are taking  measures that loom the continuity of the State of right; and we #would not be faithful to the promises that have taken to the population of *Macao and *Hong *Kong, #would not be loyal to our values, #if we do not protest *cuando *nos seem that said values see  loomed.
We #can accept in principle the *segunda splits of the amendment 12, on condition that the term fix  in 30 June 2002, and the amendment 15, on condition that the date for the prohibition of the use of *hidroclorofluorocarburos virgin fix  in 2008 and that the prohibition of the use *hidroclorofluorocarburos recycled fix  in 2010.
Report (To5-0092/1999) of the Mr. *Busk, in name of the Commission of Fishing, on the proposal of Regulation (*CE) of the Council by the that they establish  measured of applicable control in the zone of the Agreement on the future cooperation *multilateral in the *caladeros of the Atlantic northeastern (*COM(1999) 345 - *C5-0201/1999 - 1999/0138(*CNS))
The European Union has to represent a paper of engine in the future discussions. In effect, as it has seen  very well, the European Union has known to impose like an indispensable intermediary among the States Joined and the *PVD.
The competent commission has to appoint a speaker, the speaker has to elaborate a report, and the modification, #if it accepts , has to be approved by a qualified majority of our Assembly, majority that comprises more of the half of his members.
Even here in the European Parliament has said  that exists the general goal to boost the equality of opportunities for men and women in #all the political programs and in #all the political sectors.
#Can make , besides, an exhaustive balance of the means that *Europa, as #such, endows  from takes varied decades to build the equality of sexes, especially in matter of compatibility among the familiar and professional life, #as well as to combat the maltreatments that suffer the women?
But, nevertheless, I want to underline, as already they have taken it #some orators, that the fulfillment of the commitments of the platform of *Beijing forces mainly to the states members, forces mainly to the governments. The horizontal strategy of the European Union finds  in flat second.
Last night, as I create, the Council of Agriculture no only adopted a position on the resolution of the Report *Papayannakis, that results *algo precipitated, but that besides, create, modified the juridical foundation of the text on the that the Mr. *Papayannakis elaborated his report.
The effects of *Seatlle also have weighed in this decision, by the fact of *privilegiar the principle of caution and prevail the health of the citizens before that the rules of the market.
The Council urged to the Commission to that it delivered a special report on the measures that have applied  lately and on the that are applying  to reduce the delays and the jams in the aerial traffic European.
#All the parts #would have to collaborate in a #inspired environment in the confidence and abstain to undertake actions that #can put in danger a solution of the problem of the *Sáhara Western based in the respect of the human rights and of the democracy.
Besides, the #finnish Presidency took a statement on 21 June 1999, in the *cual reiterated  the support of the EU to the plan of peace of the UN and to the actions related with #the same.
Besides, the efficiency of the work of the Council #would see  affected notably, #if the meetings of the Council left to celebrate  during a week to the month and, therefore, it was necessary *insertarlas even more tightly in the remaining weeks.
Eight hours, as aptly it has said the Speaker in exercise of the Council, #would have to be the maximum limit allowed in #all the European Union for the transport of animals alive.
But we go to create a frame of practices legitimate; we try to fix rules for a healthy competition, of #such mood that each, in accordance with his possibilities and his faculties, #can advance to the future with the best perspective.
We do not believe that the amendment *nº 18, relative to the obligation of the debtors to deliver a letter of change in the case of long periods of contractual payment have possibility to be accepted by the Council.
But in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to that  *nos cleared -as it is not present the Council #would appreciate that it took it the Commissioner *Byrne before initiating  the debate- how have to interpret the statements and the conclusions of the Council that have in front.
5) The Council has examined a document of work prepared by the services of the Commission to the *respecto -14015/99- and has taken note of the existence of a big majority in favour of the bottom of the text;
*Les call the attention, to be precise, on the fact that the optional diet of each country, or of some countries, do not converts  like this without more in the compulsory general diet of #all the Union.
It is a state of things absolutely scandalous that are here seated in a parliamentary Assembly with the ninety percent of his empty seats, a week before Christmas, examining a regulation that nobody knows how and when will go in in vigour, with a Council that *nos is treating with contempt.
Regrettable only has taken  in #one #few countries, whereas in other countries is costing *muchísimo set up this decision. In these countries not even has begun  to build the system of labeling.
Likewise we are arguing the behaviour of the Council and the behaviour and the posture of the Commission. For the labeling of the meat of *vacuno the Commission *nos has presented two proposals.
It is regrettable that the debates on these so complex and important questions have had to celebrate in the frame of an urgent decision with an almost impossible term to fulfil.
Obviously, the use of *BST #can cause a change of the habits of the consumers. In this way, the existent disequilibrium in the sectors of the milk and the dairy products and the meat of *vacuno #would finish aggravating even more.
In this sense follow entrusting in the support of *Europa, a support that go directed to the preparation of the *timorenses, with the exact understanding of the universal values, not to betray, in last instance, the suffering of our village.
In this prize see the recognition of the European Parliament to the value of my village when struggling by a free homeland in the that the of thought was guaranteed like inherent right to the human condition.
It #would wish to give the thanks to the Mrs. Speaker in exercise of the Council by this so clear statement, and also #would want to signal in this sense that, to the *hacerla in advance, east is the only moment, during #all the budgetary procedure, that the Council has reached no only get to time, but even before.
No to the Commission, undoubtedly, #such as it showed it in *Seattle, neither to the Council, that in *segunda reading takes a cut *funesto of 450 millions of euros in the compulsory costs, neither -alas- to this Parliament, that, by means of his speaker, pretends to question the existence of the compulsory costs.
The simple fact, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, that *me direct to *ustedes in #german tongue shows that the fixed price of the book do not constitutes a problem of field exclusively national, but a subject of type *transfronteriza that affects also to diverse linguistic islands, in addition to to *Alemania and to *Austria.
In his proposal of resolution, my Group underlines that the books are first of all cultural sakes, and do not have to, as, subject to the norms of competition of #the same form that the rest of the commodities.
Already I indicated that, regarding the specific case *alemano-#austrian that it is object of a procedure, alas, #can not go in in details; without embargo, *les #can guarantee that during the first three months of my mandate *me have employed in depth in *reunirme with the parts and in looking for possibilities of a positive solution.
They remain here equally comprised the elimination of the corruption, the solution of the social problems linked to the #asian economic crisis and the need of *relanzar the national economy, seriously *quebrantada.
In this moment, two citizens of the EU expect the execution of the pity of death: a Spanish in the *Yemen and an Italian in the #EE.UU. This last, the Mr. *Barnabei, will be executed in the year 2000.
It has imposed  a wild social code, based in the intimidation, the humiliation and the *coacción of a feminine population that has been simply undressed of #all his fundamental human rights.
We #can not *asociarnos to the protest against the conditions of arrest of the political prisoners in *Djibouti but affirming clearly that, #if well the *carceleros are in that country, the true responsible find  in #some of the official palaces of the French Republic.
In the last months, has carried out by part of the Government a systematic weakening of the *Contraloría General, This process of weakening culminated in a pact that celebrated the Government with an ancient party of the Government.
As we already have heard, in this moment do not have to *preocuparnos by the health of the gentleman *Jarquín, but will observe with attention that receives a suitable deal, and *nos concern especially the informations according to the *cual his family in particular his daughter has been assaulted physically.
But it that it is absolutely unquestionable for any impartial observer is that here it that has wanted to  take is to avert precisely the investigation of the corruption with the collusion, besides, of the *sandinistas and to remove of in half to the one who went to be the boss of the opposition in the Republic of *Nicaragua.
*Permítanme That on the subject of the women in *Kuwait say in brief that the Commission, to the equal that the deputies to the European Parliament, is very disappointed by the result of the votes of 30 November in said country.
The Commission has followed with big worry the course of the events that have conducted to the arrest and imprisonment of the *Contralor General of *Nicaragua, the gentleman *Jarquín. *Nos Have joined to the initiative to east concerning the *troica of the European Union, of 18 November.
Besides, the States members of the Union and the European Commission have adopted and supported a series of initiatives additional for the promotion of the ratification of the statute.
So much in the plane of the private sakes and of the public sakes in matter of dramas and heavy infrastructures as in the plane of the economic instrument, the needs are enormous: of the order of six *millardos of frank French, as it has remembered .
Already they know that from it takes years no longer exists a budgetary line in the budgets of the European Community allocated to confront the natural catastrophes that produce  in the countries of the Union.
They are in accordance with the procedure, although it is true that #would have been much better #if we had had the opportunity of *debatirlas in the commission and, as it said  at the beginning of the week, *ello #would have constituted an optimum opportunity to argue the subject.
Therefore, it has to be *prioritario for the institutions put the means so that these data are increasingly complete, more reliable and faster, by it that the agricultural statistics have to be increasingly flexible, more harmonic, more merged with the #others statistical fields with possibility to incorporate new sources.
This file has a history and, in reality, today, it that *les propose is to conclude a file that opened  in 1991 on a loan of 1 *millardo 200 millions of euros to the new independent States, in the moment of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
*Tayikistán Is sure enough the poorest country of the new independent States, that has to stabilise totally, since a bit to the equal that *Chechenia and by other reasons, is a country that #can put in danger to #all the region, mainly by his strategic position regarding *Kazajstán and to *Uzbekistán that they are countries very rich.
The reasons are the following: the financial contribution of the community will continue being high in a region #whose stability has worsened , so much by the #russian financial crisis as by the current situation in the north of the *Cáucaso.
Gentleman President, ignore #if it treats  of a technical correction but finish to discover that I do not appear among the deputies *luxemburgueses in the Record of the Wednesday, relative to the report of the Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi on the verification of powers.
The article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that constitutes the base of the politics of cohesion, has suffered an erroneous translation in #any of the official tongues of the Union.
The EU goes to pose also in the future to the #sudanese Government questions of human rights with the purpose to reach of said Government a change of attitude also regarding the slavery.
The EU is of the opinion that the dialogue among the Indian and *Pakistán is the key for the solution of the conflict of Cashmere, that taxes especially the relations among both countries.
We do not go to tackle here, with #all the depth that #would deserve the case, the problem of *Gibraltar, that is a colony of a Been member inside another Been member partner of the European Union, which is an anachronism in the threshold of the century *XXI.
Gentleman President, the resolution on the improvement of the institutions without modifying the Treaties constitutes #one of the elements contributed by the Parliament to instrument the European Union for the future.
Like this the things, the mental reservations, the distrusts and the tendency to enclose  #can increase, in place to diminish, and *influenciar the conflicts among the parties and the political representatives creating some *disgregación and *algo of insecurity.
I have treated to work like his speaker in this sense and, to said end, *me were very useful the works of the Commission of Subjects External, Security and Political of Defence, #as well as the amendments presented.
By it that refers  to the particular case of Malt, *me *congratulo of the recommendation of the Commission according to the *cual the critical examination of the #maltese legislation #would have to begin immediately, so that the negotiations with this country #can initiate before the end of this year.
Only they #can reach some progresses limited in relation to the process of adaptation general and to the execution of the in the short term relative priorities to the collaboration for the integration.
Regarding *Hungría #can be very brief: Important progresses in #some areas, especially thanks to the approval of a package of reforms general for the administration of justice, #as well as to the conclusion of the structural economic reforms.
Without embargo, in #some areas, like the of the protection of the environment, the process of harmonisation legislative is developing  rather slowly, and also the planning of the regional development finds  still in his initial stage.
Likewise, it goes  recognising increasingly the risk that the agreements, #if well the companies fulfil with the juridical conditions to be able to receive to the exemption by category, in the practical finish *surtiendo effects of *falseamiento of the competition #if they sign  among companies with a strong position in the market.
In *tercer place, have a question on the period of transition for the agreements in course; *me ask #if the agreements signed under the current diet will be able to execute entirely under this current diet or #if  *les will apply the new diet, in #whose case pray that it indicate from when.
. Gentleman President, *Señorías, in the first place, want to congratulate to the Defender of the Village and to his services by the transparency and rapidity with that have *rendido explain on his activities, no only in front of this Parliament and the Commission of Requests, but directly to the citizens and associations of the States members.
The right of request #can exert it #all the residents of the European Union -and no only the citizens of the Union- #as well as the organisations based in the European Union.
*Yo *me Incorporated to the Parliament in March of this same year and from then have not left to be member of said commission. *Ello *me Has allowed to observe of wall until how point the Mr. *Newman has encouraged  by the well of the citizens.
It is, without embargo, it that *sucede in this case. Of the annual report of the Defender of the #european Village for 1998 gives off that his institution appears among the most operative and the most efficient of the European Union.
There #be a deep international ignorance about the right of family and about it that *sucede #if the marriage undoes  and the boys have to go to live to a country that is not the of his usual residence.
It wanted to propose to the Plenary that, given the hour, immediately after the report of the Mr. *Valverde, advanced in the vote on *Kosovo, to express the position of the Parliament on this so important subject.
The deputies to the European Parliament of the *PASOK represent a country that suffers directly the consequences of the war and that, from the *primer moment, has loaned help in the drama of the *albanokosovares that have seen  forced to abandon his homes.
A safe public opinion that only there will be attacks of rockets and by aviation -but no participation of military strengths of fight that #can have drops in the terrain- #can support by *algún time the bombardments, in name of the conviction of the unfair and abominable diet of *Milosevic and of his barbarism against the #Kosovar.
We have wanted that it reigned the right in the international society and today consent, of the way more *humillante, an abuse of authority North American, without that it mediate any mandate of the UN.
It has wanted to  invent the principle of the selective humanitarian interference, because it punishes to *Milosevic by the ethnic cleansing, but ignores the problem *kurdo in *Turquía and opens *inquietantes stages for the hot zones of *Europa: *Córcega, *Irlanda and the Basque Country in *España.
The intervention in the war, under the control of the NATO, do not translates, as, an absence of politics #european, but an erroneous #european politics.
This political error inscribes  inside a logic that traces back to the option that the following day to the fall of the Wall of *Berlín effected #all a generation of leaders and of #european managers.
For example, the amount of the *gravámenes on the vehicles #can vary in 3.000 euros to the year, exist nine distinct varieties of rates for the transports by railway and the grade of coverage of the costs #can oscillate among a 0 and a 100 %.
I am convinced that in this community normative stage the approach differentiated will be more effective and besides will respect totally the legitimate papers of the normative sectors of the transport in other political planes.
#All know that this sphere, the question of the rates by the use of roads, of lines *férreas, of aerial lines or of maritime lines, is *plagada of obstacles and that the progress, especially in the political plane, #can be of a slowness *penosa.
Besides, the Council has not accessed to the request of the Parliament to foresee fiscal advantages with idea to boost the moods of transport alternative.
It is known that the entities of credit traditional are, already of by yes, authorised to issue electronic money, in application of the group of the banking directives, and by this new service #can cost of the #european passport.
Also it is possible that this logic  base, simply, in the easy #obtaining of benefits, in place to take into account the character of service of general interest that #would have to have the banks, for #all a series of consumers.
I create, as, that gather  the conditions to continue the work, and #if  *me allows to express a personal wish, #this consists in that the Mr. *Prodi integrate to the Mr. *Monti in his new squad; *ello #would not take more that benefit so much to the Commission as to the Parliament.
Without embargo, is not possible to create by law an only financial area to the by minor in that the basic banking transactions are economic and effective, #such as it occurs in the national systems, although the frame of performance shows how #can carry  forward this process.
#This *nos forces to reiterate that, regarding the system of transports, the election *prioritaria of the European Union has to be the to move big part of the heavy traffic of the road to the railway.
In particular, after the closing of the tunnel, are multiplying  the cancellations of reservations *hoteleras in the Valley of *Aosta. Therefore, it exists also an economic look, related with the tourism, extremely important for this region, that will have to be taken in account.
In it that to the consequences of the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc refers , the Commission will employ #all the means inside the field of his limited competitions to procure that the development of the traffic do not see  seriously altered.
The truth is that *Birmania possesses supports very important, in particular -and regret the absence of our Commissioner *Brittan- *Birmania is firmly supported by Chinese, so much in the economic plane as in the soldier, and *eso is it that *le allows to follow repressing and preventing any type of development democratic.
It is true that the Mr. Go of *Broek, that do not has attributions in the field of the Politics of Competition, #can not but read *aquello that the services of the Commission, is to say, the services of the Mr. Go *Miert, *le had noted.
After debating a report of #the same speaker on the politics of the European Union in May of 1998, approve a resolution on the improvement of the operation of the #european institutions.
The actuality *nos remembers each day the political lagoons of the #european construction and the inability of the Union to face up by himself/hisself same to the majority of the great challenges that  *le present.
We expect that the government occupy  that the campaign of information programmed was plural of #such form that inform so much on the advantages as on the problems of the adhesion and that this information was available freely for #all the citizens of Malt.
The cooperation is likewise #one of the master keys that characterise the relations among the Commission of Requests of the European Parliament and the Defender of the #european Village.
Without embargo, the speaker goes too much far when demanding that also it include  in the system of *tarificación the transport deprived no commercial in car, in name of a just cast of the costs among #all the users of the infrastructure of the roads.
In this context #would have been interesting that the Commission *nos had specified how much collect the States of the EU in concept of taxes on the vehicles, imposed of consumption on the petrol, the diesel, etc., and how proportion of the taxes collected invests  afterwards in infrastructure and works of repair.
Equally we agree with the Mrs. speaker in asking to the Commission that define the priorities on the plans selected, to end to use with the greater possible efficiency the available resources.
The Commission appreciates also the important paper that the European Parliament exerts when including the fight against the violence in the program of work of the European Union.
The competition in matter of juridical protection of the consumers has to attribute, to end to guarantee the internal coherence of the text approved, to the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Inner Market.
Of here that it consider very grave the decision that takes *usted, gentleman President, very grave in the current context -although this was not so grave- and very grave also for the future of this Parliament and for the future of the democracy in *Europa.
It was as it went, our Group has presented knowingly an amendment so as to embezzle the juridical protection of the consumers to the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens.
Gentleman President, have two functions: in the first place, like original author of the document directed to change the structures of the commissions and, second, like president of the commission commissioned in this moment of the relative politics to the consumers.
In this end of the century *XX, the violence in #all his forms exerted against the boys, the teenagers and the women has gone taking an increasingly worrisome look.
Thus it is indispensable that this program of action community #can inscribe in a general context that at the same time keep a strong social security and allow an economic growth that generate put of durable work.
But the statistics do not reflect to #that that by the retirement anticipated or other measures do not appear in the statistics of unemployment, is to say, that the unemployment of the persons of age is, in reality, higher.
*Señorías, now, in name of the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left/Nordic Green Left, and, by the maximum time of six minutes, go to give the word to the Mrs. *Ilivitzky.
#This has to  so much to the lower level *salarial of the women -that the women suffer, therefore, by double game- as to the fact that the professional careers of the women are shorter and discontinuous owing to the tasks of assistance.
*Me Allow to remember that this situation is resulted of the granting taken to States Joined, in the moment to sign  the Treaty of Blunt, of a right to the import of soya to the Community with a type #zero.
The Commission always has protected  in that the reduction of the prices *redunda in benefit of the competitiveness of the EU. I suppose, as, that #can conclude that this reasoning also applies  to the sector of the starch.
Equally it wanted to express my gratitude to the Secretariat of this commission, that has taken always an excellent work so that our regulation was to the height of the needs of the parliamentary work.
Lamentably, #this has not been always the case and to the concrete reason finish to allude on purpose now the President of the Commission of Regulation, #Ben *Fayot, #as well as our colleague, the Mr. *Corbett.
Our colleague, the Mr. *Corbett, has alluded to that in this Parliament existed an opinion to take of this contractual text, relatively clear, *algo different of it that appeared and figure in the text of the Treaty.
Regarding the positive looks, wanted to underline that we have not taken a modification *ad *hoc limited to the frame of the exercise of 1996 but that have reached a valid reform for the coming years.
It is precise to vote institutional reforms oriented to the promotion of a dynamic competition and of the flexibility together with the requirement of the maintenance, but also of the modernisation and of the systems of the social security.
In the last months have had from time to time strong debates on #if we #would have to choose among having an expansionary politics as it wanted the Group *Socialdemócrata following the example of the Mr. *Lafontaine or #if by the contrary #would have to follow the rules that have agreed.
I consider urgently necessary that keep  the three more important points, in concrete, the pact for the stability and the employment, a politics *salarial oriented to the productivity and the need to make structural reforms.
In these conditions, as, have to avert #all potential division in the interior of the Union and *esforzarnos so that the adhesion to the Economic and Monetary Union of #all the countries members was a reality it before possible.
Definitely, #this #would not be possible #if #all the participants in this project -the Council, the Parliament and also, after #some initial vacillations, the Commission- had not collaborated with a very constructive spirit.
It wanted to stand out especially the constructive paper of the Commissioners #Anita *Gradin, *Karel go *Miert and #Mario *Monti, but wanted to *elogiar also on purpose to the Presidency of the Council, to our speaker, the Mr. *Bösch, #as well as to the secretariats of the three institutions by the enormous work that have made.
In the analysis of the Annual Report of 1997 of the European Court of Accounts the Council has had also in account #all the 25 specific reports that have presented  in the course of the year 1998.
During the process of approval of the management and to the light of the report of the Court of Accounts, formulate a series of questions very *inquisitivas to the Commission.
I expect that, *cuando the Commission attend again in front of the Parliament, accept and use like plan of work these questions formulated in the document of work, in particular on the politics in matter of staff, on the Offices of Assistance Technical and #Leonardo and the form as they manage  *PHARE and *TACIS.
Of course, we have worked a bit with an amicable pressure, especially, by part of the Presidency of the Council and of our Assembly, so that the Commission comprise of a time that #can not deny, without more, the things that are on the table.
It treats  of a document of work excellent and, of course, *yo personally share the philosophy of the approach, that is a clear philosophy and that, to #the same time, specifies the essential points.
*Nos Seems important that the #european citizens do not have the impression of that the Community is conditioned in his capacity of adoption of decisions like consequence of the entrance in vigour of the new Treaty or of the parliamentary election.
The attention to the elderly, the work for handicapped persons and projects of environment, #etcetera, to the equal that the Mrs. *Thyssen neither want to take any election and leave freedom to the States members so that they choose among the possibilities that offers the proposal and so that they watch it that better *les avenges with his needs and possibilities.
Finally, I have to underline that #if, as I boast, #all *nosotros wish the fast adoption of this proposal by the Council, so as to fulfil the terms signalled by the Mrs. *Thyssen, is to say, the entrance in vigour on 1 January 2000, #can not admit the amendments.
Therefore, in some measure -appear #if it was not like this- #can share his aspirations that are the #mine, in an assessment of realism political in a matter that affects to the employment and in that the urgency is maximum.
In the point 8, «Presentation of documents», in the *subpunto *ab) mentions  the project of decision of the relative European Parliament to the Statute of the Deputies to the European Parliament and to continuation appears a reference «*C».
It is truth that is a subject linked to the Diary 2000, but do not find any reason that endorse the urgency asked by the Council, since the disposal has to go in in vigour during the year 2000 and, in consequence, there #be sufficient time so that the new Parliament #can *examinarla.
The Treaty already has gone in in vigour and his first consequence is a greater participation of the future President of the Commission and of the European Parliament in the nomination of the Commission.
It wanted to underline also that expect that there #be a political balance, is to say, a balance of conceptions and political opinions and also some balance that reflect the paper of the main political strengths in this Parliament.
Finally, we expect truly that in case that it assume *usted the power, in any case work  urgently in favour of a #balkan initiative and also review  the calendar of the politics of enlargement to the light of the current events.
It is interesting because it is socialist and because it is #french. Interesting because it is socialist and affirms that the problem of the employment will be able to confront  only #if it guarantees , especially, a goal of growth and establishes  in a 3 %; interesting because it is #french and affirms the need to begin to consider to the Council of the euro integrated by 11 members as *primer test of economic government European.
In consequence, challenged by an international crisis that goes back to put in cloth of trial the certainty of the end of the *II World-wide War, #this is, that the war was impossible in *Europa, have to *dotarnos of new political programs and necessarily ambitious, #if we want really go back to find this soul of *Europa that *usted so much mentions.
They require  new approaches, under the form of a participation reinforced of the States members; the subsidiariness also in the execution of the #european tasks discharge of work to *Bruselas and reinforces the consciousness of the *corresponsabilidad of #all, a consciousness that up to now has not existed.
This speech, nevertheless, #can not take it with *cerrazón, #can not it take with a continent that puts his own limits, although it has converted  in greater: have to take it accepting the challenge that, in this case, is also a responsibility.
It will happen to form part of the history of his village like the destroyer of Serbian and is not taking more that repeat the experience that already lived before #others that placed in front the big «adjective» to the name of his nation.
Also it has seen  that the idea that the NATO #can constitute an alternative to the Nations Joined -although it only went for a region circumscribed, but that extends  much more there of *Europa- has shown to be an erroneous conclusion; *yo always went of #that seem.
#Everything *eso means an enormous and costly effort, in addition to the military borne by our States members to contribute the thousands of millions of euros that will need  to fund #all these measures of the international community.
Therefore, I take advantage of this opportunity, in name of the Commission, to ask to the Parliament and to the Council that facilitate to the Commission in his moment the instruments and necessary bottoms to take our contribution to #that *tremendo imperative that we will have to confront together.
I have written #one and another time to the competent persons, is to say, to the President of the European Parliament, to the President of the Commission, to the NATO and to the Mr. #Clinton.
In similar conditions, the only military victory possible runs the big risk to be a victory *pírrica, far of the conditions of a just and durable peace, that is it that ask in these moments.
A war that scheduled  win in two days but that after five weeks has not waned. A war initiated to save to persons of the ethnic cleansing and that has given like result a million of refugees.
The countries of the Union have to be had to support a Plan #Marshall for the region of the *Balcanes to reconstruct the cities destroyed and also to counter the hate that, of another mood, goes to remain during generations like broth of crop for new conflicts.
Of #the same mood, do not create absolutely neither by an instant, treating of a so gross character as *Milosevic, that was sensitive to a measure like the unilateral cessation of our attacks to begin to negotiate.
In the twelve last months there #be had the establishment of the euro and deserve an external politics that was to the height of the perspectives created in the rest of the world by our monetary union.
Although it result painful, there #be not another explanation for a #willing Union to argue a war no by oil, no for achieving can, but for *oponerse to the perversion of the ethnic purification in the heart of *Europa.
We forget, by our account and risk, that *Constantinopla was, during centuries, the first capital #european of the culture, *cuando our ancestors of the Council of Ministers current were camping in the ruins of a past glory.
We have sinned, in #a lot of senses, by *complacencia: often we say that the justification of the European Union is the to rid  of the wars inside the borders of *Europa and forget it that is *sucediendo just in front of the borders of *Europa and our responsibility to the *respecto.
This circumstance demands a diversification in the interior of the Union, the *cual #would owe to his time centre around a union among States, a confederation, in place of a union of States, a federation.
Gentleman President, in the meeting of the Conference of Presidents of this afternoon get to an agreement to treat to organise the vote so that it was a clear vote that show #who is in favour to put order and #who no.
For example, the subject of the *inelegibilidad and of the incompatibility, the limitation of the number of mandates, the reduction of the number of deputies, the *superación effective of the conflicts of interests.
The Commission of Budgets thinks, and *yo share this opinion, that the goal of not using more of the 20 % of the total game of administrative costs for the Parliament, a goal that certainly are fulfilling from takes years, has to fulfil without fail.
It is to appreciate that the administration *nos have ensured that it will be able to fulfil #all the additional tasks that arise after going in in vigour the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #as well as the that originate  to cause the preparation of the enlargement, with the current personnel.
By this reason, the Commission of budgets has supported fundamentally the new politics of personnel, #whose central point is the promotion according to the criterion of the merits achieved during years, it that will have like consequence that a promotion make  after some five years respectively.
I believe that a Parliament that want to fulfil with the tasks to the that is exposed from the Treaty of *Amsterdam, has to have of a structure of personnel, also on a structure of collaborators personal, that *le make possible to make these tasks in his whole.
Therefore it #would recommend to the new Parliament, to go back to occupy  of this point, because *nos have detained two years for having fulfilled other tasks, and also *nosotros will have to go back to treat this point, #if we want to make a good work.
With the approval of the preliminary draft of budget general for the exercise 2000, the Commission has initiated the budgetary procedure for the budgetary authority.
In my opinion the common position of the Council, independently of it defective that it was by the no participation of the Commission, finds  in the Commission of Transports, as it has explained it the President, and #this do not gathers  this week.
#If we want *encaminarnos to an inner market that work *óptimamente, #all the consumers #would have to have the right to be able to enjoy of a big level of protection, the same in #all the States members #where buy, to *través of the extremely fast field of the new media, #such like Internet and email.
Certainly I agree with #some of the amendments presented by the speaker, included the need to establish a term of seven skillful days so that the provider return the money received of the consumer.
The Commission #can accept the principle established in the amendment 21 to offer to the consumers before the celebration of the hire additional information or *resumida like a protection of the complete contractual conditions.
#If a consumer mounts a product *él same and produces  a defect owing to a failure in the instruction of setting allocated to the customer, this failure drops under the right of guarantee.
Without embargo, the own speaker of opinion -that do not know #if it is here- recognises that these administrative costs #can have to to the paper that play the experts, to the connection with the network, to the analyses, to the training.
Seen that there are not deputies that take part in the debate, the Presidency wanted to *felicitarla by his report and comment that the fault of interest probably have to  more to the consensus that arouses that to any discrepancy with the subject.
It was the Parliament the that, even before the Treaty went in in vigour, put on the table of the Council a very complete text in the that, with the maximum transparency, included  #all the looks of our situation, even #that in the that it always has been #ours competition decide.
In his quality of President of this Assembly, has loaned hearings of a new and innovative way to the novel deputies, *algo that has been received with big satisfaction and has been respected by the deputies.
In the months that have had the privilege to direct to my Group, #can confirm the courtesy that *usted has shown with my person -of it that today give faith here- and confirm also the extraordinary opening with the that makes his work.
The Council has agreed the past week begin with the preparation of a pact of stability for the *sureste of *Europa, an initiative that meanwhile is hailed openly by the whole of the international community.
Already the Bosses of State and of Government have wanted to designate to a President of the most political Commission, commissioned to explode #all the federalistic possibilities that offers the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, believe that so much in the intervention of the President *Santer -that has been a splendid intervention and want to *felicitarle thus- as in the of the rest of the colleagues of this Parliament goes to find *usted a rare unanimity.
Like help to the *preadhesión have put  to disposal roughly 22.000 millions of euros for the approach #as well as other 58.000 millions of euros for costs conditioned by the enlargement, is to say, that in the period of finance has  of 80.000 millions of euros for the enlargement but that only #can  spend #if really it carries out the enlargement.
#If *me allow that it make a personal observation - probably is my last intervention in front of the European Parliament- is interesting to see that a Diary like the Diary 2000 is of course a conflict of distribution among the States members.
It is not that the argue, is not that it deny to the Mr. *Prodi his freedom of consciousness, but, because I am linked to the laicism, *garante precisely of this fundamental freedom everywhere and for #all, expect of a President of the Commission that watch thus, and have #some doubts on the matter.
For the future, turns  to «the #american strength, in the wide sense of the term, [that] expresses  symbolically by means of the media; it considers , sure enough, by #some able to constitute the unitary reference for *Europa in research of his soul.
We have to ascertain that the rules of the international trade that applies the *OMC and that *nos prevent to use on purpose the principle of caution, have seen  ratified in the agreements of the Round *Uruguay by the own Europeans, *extraviados *ellos same by bad advisers, like the Commission, too much *influenciada definitely by foreign interests.
It is precise to break with the way as it is thought in the actuality the liberalisation of the exchanges, without social and environmental rules, and is precise to counter the political hegemony, economic and monetary of States Joined, that finishes imposing the interest of the #american companies like a *pseudo general interest.
The hypocrisy of the European Council remains perfectly patent by the fact that it will be necessary to decide on at all less that 250 millions of euros for *Kosovo in the term of two weeks, it that supposes an utilisation of more of the three *quintas split of the total base for seven years.
In the reading of the regulations that will approve  tomorrow, seems that the cause of the insular regions will not have known significant advance with occasion of this reform of the Structural Bottoms.
This financial frame of half term neither gives answer to questions so stood out like the realisation of the euro and, in particular, the possible asymmetric crashes or the predictable results of the next negotiations in the field of the *OMC.
Always it has been entirely opened in #all moment to keep conversations and debates, always comprehensible, always kind with the members of the Commission of Politics Regional of the Parliament.
The Commission, in his report *trienal on the cohesion, has considered this situation like #one of the fundamental causes that mark the delay of these regions and condition his definite takeoff.
The that for both parts exist feasible commitments owes  alone and exclusively to *nosotros, as *nos have directed to *ustedes openly with proposals of commitment to prevent that his *terquedad *nos carried to the Committee of Conciliation, as #this #would have meant the *paralización of #a lot of projects, since then the money #would not have come to time of *Bruselas.
Solidarity inside the European Union and with the States of *preadhesión, employment concentrated of credits, creation of places of work, reduction of the bureaucracy and preparation for the enlargement eastwards, #this have been from the principle the goals of the reform of the structural Bottoms.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, the new Regulation for the politics of promotion and development of the rural areas is definitely a big step in the reform of the Common Agricultural Politics.
It is not still an authentic tree, but #if the Commission and the Council occupy  with #the same intensity of this youngster *arbolito, will result a strong tree and with hit for the politics in the rural areas.
Gentleman President, the goal of my report is the to endow to the European Union of the financial and budgetary frame adapted to confront the challenges of the next years.
Knowing these commitments, *nos will prepare of the corresponding mood for the new negotiations of the *OMC and the negotiations of enlargement and will have it besides in account in the execution of the regulation of market during the next years.
In it *tocante to the date of payment of the 31-10, am had to examine this question, #if well with the limitation that it do not has to  produce thus a postponement of the budgetary exercise for the compulsory costs.
Consider the work like economic opportunity, and to #the same time like realisation of #one same means to study more and better along #all the life, means to struggle against the material and current inequalities that affect to the possibility that #all person has to plan freely his future.
But, on the other hand, neither we #can accept a protectionist road like the strategy with the that were digging our ruin and in the that were evading the responsibilities that have in front of the world, in particular with the less developed zones.
How measured thinks to adopt the Council to avert the repetition of this type of actions and to guarantee the freedom of circulation of the citizens in the EU?
*Me #Would enjoy *darle the graces by his answer, without embargo, do not understand why leave  to a side the disposals of the regulation of personal as it do not exists at all that it prevent that in the integration respect  the valid norms in the Council.
The concrete question of how goes  to take to reduce of *algún mood the damages *ocasionados and, possibly, to pose juridical claims by part of the European Union, is a question that has to direct to the Commission and no to the Council.
The Resolution 687 of the Council of Security of the Nations Joined urged to *Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the #Red Cross with regard to the release of these prisoners.
In it *tocante to his wider question on the global stability of the region, the 26/27-4-1999 the Council got to the conclusion to begin with the *preparativos for a pact of stability for the *Sureste of *Europa.
But equally it is true that, also jointly, #can not deny the fact that a big group of the society, persons in a position of disadvantage, among *ellas the women and the minorities, need an additional attention.
The agricultural model European do not know exactly #which is neither nobody knows it, but, in any case, pretend to defend this model, a model that keep to the agriculturalist in the earth and the less uninhabited earth.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, the financial frame decided in *Berlín is totally unsuitable and insufficient to give answer to the needs and to the goals of the cohesion, that #would have to orient the #european construction and his current and future ambitions.
I expect that we leave clear to #everyone and in #all moment that have carried out the #granting that expected  of *nosotros in the negotiations in the World-wide Organisation of Trade and that do not contemplates  neither an alone granting more to the #european agriculturalists until they have passed these seven years.
This process has finished well, has had a happy epilogue for the countries of the cohesion and for the poorest regions, #where concentrate , in fact, from now, the structural helps.
It has finished well, I #can not by less to say it, for my country, that goes to receive with charge to the structural helps an annual average lightly upper to the annual average of the period 1994 to 1999.
The nuclear security is a very important, but in the process of adhesion #can not force like this without more to the closing of head offices nuclear, neither *presionar of this way to the countries.
My Group, the *PPE, #can not more that ascertain the result of the Summit of *Berlín that, #if well it represents a considerable improvement in relation with the original proposal of the Commission, remains  short #if we take into account the needs of the producers.
In *tercer place, #if it produced  the blockade to a measure and, afterwards, remitted  again to the legislative authority, this return affected only to the Council, no jointly to the Council and to the Parliament, even #if these two institutions conform jointly the legislative authority.
Really there are #a lot of reasons to begin to say that *México do not has the frame of reference, the *marchamo democratic, etc. But believe that it better that #can take by *México, by the democracy and by the agreement with the European Union is to say that yes .
The fact that of the total of the #mexican exports to the European Union only the 9 % are agricultural and that exist a big complementarity in the commercial flow, #would have to facilitate the fast negotiation and entrance in vigour of this agreement.
Gentleman President, only wanted to remember to #some colleagues, and in particular to the Mr. *Elles, that the training of the will of the institutions, in accordance with a jurisprudence *consolidadísima of the Court of Justice of *Luxemburgo, is not matter *dispositiva: it is question of public order and is in the Treaties.
Gentleman President, wanted to *rendir a *calurosísimo homage to my colleague, the Mrs. *Oddy, by this report that, of characteristic mood, has carried out in the last days of the Parliament in a commission in the that there were other worries and #where existed immense juridical and technical complications.
And we will vote against because we understand that they break this balance, because, in spite of it that has said the Mr. *Barzanti that, like philosophy share totally, believe that lean service takes  to the providers of content, in general terms to the authors, in other fields and -answering to the Mr. *Whitehead- to the consumers, #if we take juridical voluntarism.
In my opinion, the European Union #would have to show active with seen to establish a favourable and effective movement to protect the civil rights in the computer networks.
In the amendment 36 proposes  that the providers that loan services of the society of information will have to conserve #all the data that require  to the hour to investigate and identify to the providers of material illegal.
The majority of the amendments that contains the report of the Mrs. *Oddy clear and improve the initial proposal and *me cheers to indicate that the Commission will accept the amendments *núms. 1, 2, 4, 6 -this last only in the #english version-, 7, 12, 13, 16-20, 22, 24, 32-34, 37, 40, 41, 43, 55-57, 62 and 65-67.
#This a sensitive and very important area in the that took  special efforts in the original proposal to get to a solution of commitment reasonable that took into account #all the interests in game.
I have examined also the argument that *usted has exposed on #if this decision in yes comports budgetary decisions and also has examined it attentively our Juridical Service, is to say, #if it comports budgetary decisions for the that the article 272 #would demand qualified majority.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, *yo also want to break a spear in favour of the argumentation of *Detlev *Samland, and *eso by the following reason. Gentleman President, the jurisprudence that *usted quotes stipulates that the institutions #can not review to the drop the majorities established by the Treaty.
#If it is really necessary that the Treaty demand in each case, of precise way, the qualified majority, and limit the cases of enlargement of this qualified majority, said agreement *interinstitucional, as it finishes to suggest it the Mr. *Colom *i Naval, is inadmissible.
The European Commission approved the past 28 April the preliminary draft of budget of the European Union for the exercise 2000, *primer year of application of the new financial perspectives.
The tenacity and the perseverance of the members of the Commission of Politics Regional of the European Parliament and of our two speakers have given finally his fruits.
#This obtains a complementary endowment of 15 millions of *ecus to compensate the loss of his suitability with regard to the Goal 1, whereas the *Hainaut #french, that is bordering, do not obtains at all: discrimination that do not justifies neither the *PNB neither the tax of unemployment of the two regions.
To the term of my mandate, in May of 1999, my political positions on these social questions, as they are the agriculture, the feeding, the rural development and the environment, follow being #the same.
The fact to want to fix a maximum limit to the helps and of *reducirlas regularly constitutes a total aberration regarding the level of income of these producers.
#If they achieve  approve common norms that elevate the level of protection of the consumers in #all the countries, no longer will have *tanta importance that the valid norms are the of the country of the *remitente or the of the country of origin.
Vote against of the proposal of resolution on *Kosovo, because I consider that it do not helps at all to find a political solution, neither finally immediate of this war without sense - especially today, 45 days afterwards, in that they begin to discern  hopes to escape of this tragic dead end.
It treats  definitely of a complex situation and expect, gentleman Commissioner and Vice-president, that in name of the Commission and in name of the European Union adopt  the timely measures to reinforce these tendencies, since in the actuality *Turquía is moving away of *Europa instead of approximating  to *ella.
Never we have wanted to justify his acts neither his intentions. Only we expect that the #turkish Government allow that it celebrate  an open and just process, but alas #ours *angustiosos presentiments do not see  at all relieved.
It is not #worthy of the democracy that *Malasia says to be the fact that the citizens that express peacefully his points of sight political or religious are object of arrest and *encarcelación, and all *ello without that offer  a suitable juridical security.
It is to say, in the international plane is taking  consciousness of this situation, and do not is necessary to exasperate because this type of battles, like the that *usted signalled, finally, as it #be to occur always with #all the problems that affect to the humanity, is to base of a daily fight and *tenaz as they finish  achieving results.
By it that to me *respecta, gentleman President, wish to say that I regret that the considering *G of this proposal of resolution common allow to warm up doubts on the comments that #can effect this Parliament on purpose of the initiatives taken by the president of the Commission of Development and Cooperation, the Mr. #Michel *Rocard.
Finally -and I will not insist too much in this point-, the responsibility of *Francia, illustrated until the caricature by the coincidence among the *decimoctavo coup d'état in the *Comoras and the opening in #París of the trial to the mercenary #Bob *Denard, author, in 1975, 1978, 1989 and 1995, of four coups d'état in *Moroni and suspicious of the murder of two Bosses of State *comoranos.
The Islamic Republic of the *Comoras is a State that from takes #a lot of years, practically from his independence, suffers an institutional and structural crisis very grave, as they have remembered the colleagues that have taken part before that *yo.
Perhaps it know that there #be had a statement of the ministers of the *G8 offering some conditions for a solution in *Kosovo much less *intransigentes that the five conditions in the that has insisted  up to now and that goes back to link of significant form to the Council of Security.
Regarding the system, more general, of recognition of titles, am likewise in favour of an improvement and of a reinforcement of the recognition of the qualifications, since #if well the recognition of titles is theoretically satisfactory, do not translates  sufficiently in the facts.
The commitment that has accepted  in the conciliation relieves the charge of the #SME, which fits to expect that it encourage to these companies to orient his efforts to goals more favourable and that boost the creation of employment.
In the European Union and in the States members has awarded  especially a fundamental paper to the small companies with predominance of hand of drama to the hour to promote the creation of employment.
Passed a week from the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, and had account of the every time greater importance that is purchasing the procedure of *codecisión, believe that have reasons for *felicitarnos by this victory of the Parliament and of the democracy.
Likewise I estimate fundamental that *nos have proposed to reduce the compulsory variables, no only regarding the charge, but also in it that to the number of variables refers . By it other, are adherents of a level of information acceptable, is to say, of a fine relation cost-efficiency.
Gentleman President, in the frame of the initiative *SLIM, the Commission presented on 30 May 1997 two proposals of regulation with the end to simplify the basic rule of the system *INTRASTAT.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the report (To4-0234/99) of the Mr. *Malangré, in name of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and of Rights of the Citizens, on the procedures of insolvency.
In the year 1995 agreed  by means of a resolution of these characteristic it that it had to understand by interception in technical sense, #if it had to register only the content of the #telephone conversation or also the hour and the number of telephone of the speakers.
To consequence of these massive imports that hardly cover, on the other hand, the price of the matter prevails, big number of #european textile companies are registering at present losses and see loomed his survival, it that puts in grave risk the maintenance of the places of work.
Of compliance with the article 13 of the Regulation, the candidatures to the functions of President of the European Parliament will have to present, with the consent of the interested, by a political Group or by thirty-two deputies like minimum.
Lady #Heidi *Hautala, in the last days have already worked very together, and an expression of this fine collaboration is, certainly, that *usted like Speaker of the Group of the Greens finds  seated in the first row, the same that the President of the Liberal, the Mr. *Pat *Cox.
#This *Europa initiates the term of office in a moment of big difficulty by it that *sucede in our borders: of big difficulty because the process of unification political and the project of politics economic follow being far of our scope.
A strong Presidency, attentive and able, balanced and just, like the that *usted already showed that it #can exert, *nos gives hope and confidence of face to work together, #all together, to end to satisfy the needs of these #european citizens that follow expecting of *nosotros a clear answer about his future.
As *les manifested takes an instant, call the attention of His *Señorías, since to the not exceeding the number of candidates of the number of places for covering, *les propose that it choose  by acclamation to these fourteen candidates for the places of Vice-presidents.
Lady Speaker, wish to take part in relation with the record because I understand that, in the day of yesterday, the Conference of Presidents and #all the political Groups subscribe jointly an objection to the constitution of the called «technical Group of independent deputies» and *yo believe that said objection has to state explicitly in the record.
In spite of #all the relative criticisms to particular cases, there #be *algo that #would not have to forget, to know, that without the work *tenaz and engaged of the Commission neither had been able to resolve the numerous and difficult problems precisely under the #german Presidency.
*Señorías, in the stage that now initiate will have to take advantage of the dynamics that has configured  in the past semester, like result of the tension among the crisis and the needs of reform, to give new steps to the integration.
But the decisions that have adopted  in the last six months, under the #german Presidency of the Council, will mark the future of the European Union until very gone in the next decade.
It has gone back  to admit in society to the war like half of the politics and will continue  advancing by this *funesto *derrotero with the integration of the military pact of the *UEO in the European Union and the creation of strengths of intervention.
*Me #Would enjoy to ask #if these three States members, that took in *Amsterdam of the strengthening of the institutions an indispensable condition and, therefore, previous for the conclusion of the first negotiations of adhesion, corroborate his reservations attach to the Treaty of *Amsterdam or #if they have attenuated his position meanwhile.
#This presupposes our firm decision of *oponernos in necessary case with military means *cuando no longer exist another possibility, to #that that think that they #can impose the politics of the nationalism with the violence, the murder, the terror or the expulsions in mass.
In the first place, because it did not take a reform of the finance of the own resources to split exclusively of the gross national product, that is the only contributory base just, *equitativa and transparent.
Besides, we need the integration of the guidelines on the politics of employment and economic and, it that it is very important, need a review of the institutional frame of the #european pact by the employment.
We need as more democracy and no an increase of the democratic deficit like consequence of the #european pact by the employment and this Parliament has demanded it in the period of term of office previous.
This Assembly will know that we have gone back to go in in a critical stage in the process of peace of *Irlanda of the North, a process that have backed the successive presidencies.
The challenge that have to confront consists in *replantear, adapt and improve the organisation for *convertirla in more efficient and effective, so as to struggle against the frauds to #all the levels and to put to the Institution to the service of the #european citizens.
I do not pretend that *Europa have #all the answers to these problems; it that I want to mean it is that we have to show our obstinacy to contribute to resolve, to scale #european, these questions, since, by his same nature, surpass the purely national borders.
In effect, some recent events, #such as the war of *Kosovo and the new crisis in the sphere of the alimentary security that has produced  in *Bélgica, but has, obviously, repercussions in #all *Europa, are events particularly significant and believe that the answers that have to give  -and *usted has given #some interesting signals to #that *respecto- are answers that have to be ambitious.
The President Mr. *Prodi shows interest with regard to the Conference *Intergubernamental, but *me seems that it do not values it sufficient the fact that the critical state of the Institutions and of the relation of fault of confidence with the citizens is not indifferent neither political neither socially.
From this perspective, the question of the headquarters of the organisms that will occupy  of the reconstruction is very important, and want to believe that it will keep  the election of *Salónica like point *nodal strategic from the that they will develop  #all the necessary plans for this substantive reconstruction.
The Council of Subjects General of the European Union highlighted the past Monday that the Union will follow helping to the #serbian village, the *cual suffers the consequences of #one *nefasta political.
The deputies of the European Parliament have underlined in diverse occasions the so important paper that the Union exerts like engine and like guarantee of the peaceful and harmonic development of our continent.
I split in my exhibition of the idea that the Union #can succeed in his functions only through a narrow and transparent collaboration among #all the parts of #the same, #as well as by means of the active support of the citizens of *Europa.
Also we need a *fortalecemiento of the credibility of the Union to take part with property in grave subjects of our competition; the establishment of terms concrete for the reconstruction of *Kosovo is the most acute.
But also it has produced wounds in #some Governments *carentes of a clear external politics. It was as it was, it has marked the failure of ten years of diplomacy and has put in evidence the *incurias, the lacks and sometimes the wastes of the international cooperation.
The impression that has  is that it did not think  so much in the activities of reconstruction immediate and for the that it #would have to be competent this Agency but in the general needs of economic help in the whole of the region.
We have to learn to combine the hand of iron of the NATO with the glove of silk economic of the EU and offer cooperation and help for the economic and democratic development.
#This is the fundamental point of the case *Öcalan, #this is, the maintenance in *demasiadas legislations of norms that punish like offence the exercise of the right of self-determination of the villages in his extreme meaning of faculty of secession, even with means no violent and democratic.
Of #the same form that there are autonomous Communities in *España, *Länder in *Alemania or Communities in *Bélgica, etc., also #would take fault an alike solution inside *Turquía for the *kurdos, so that they #can enjoy, it same that *usted signalled of *Finlandia, to be able to talk each #one his own tongue, have free press on his problems, have a regional Parliament.
We have to promote the fight against the drug trafficking, against the crime organised, against the citizen insecurity; we have to invest in the protection of the citizens and no *transigir with this unseen face that constitutes the relation among terrorism, traffic of arms, crime organised, traffic of nuclear material.
*Dinamarca Was the *primer country that proposed the importance of the no military methods, but *Finlandia, in his quality of President of the Council, is the country that has to carry to the practical it more *contudentemente possible, and with the collaboration of #all, this valid initiative.
I want to signal also that it is very important the mission of the international Court attendant to judge the crimes of war, and in particular the court commissioned of *Yugoslavia is in this moment an important *colobarador #ours in #all this question.
The process of reforms has begun in #all the institutions, among other things thanks to that the European Parliament in #a lot of occasions has called the attention on these subjects.
The Assembly will be familiarised with the article 213 that, among other things, demands specifically that the members of the Commission respect «the duties of honesty and discretion, regarding the acceptance, a time finished his mandate, of determined functions or benefits».
A simple example that #can give to the Assembly of the internal games to the that they have devoted  the bosses of cabinet -no the commissioners- in a concrete subject of personnel serves like button of sample of how handled  these things.
*Yo Hail the decision -that believe that it has been very fast- of the Council in this case and also the explanations of the Commission in relation with his performance in this case, that has been of an enormous rapidity.
Also it is necessary to recognise that the pollution of the *piensos with dioxin shows that neither the current legislation neither the measures of protection valid are sufficient to prevent the pollution of the *piensos with harmful substances, like the dioxin.
*Refiriéndome To the measures taken by the Council #would remember that the ministers of Agriculture and of Health have followed very of wall the crisis of the dioxin and have debated on *ella in the first opportunity that had , to know, in the meetings summoned in June.
Before finishing my exhibition want to observe that the crisis of the dioxin has shown clearly that the consequences of this type of events do not limit  to the zones, not even to the countries, in that they produce .
Any country of the world is free of the dioxin, and #can bring  to collation #all a series of examples of pollution by dioxin that in the last years have appeared in the headlines of the most varied countries.
I regret it a lot, and *me fear that the only that in this subject goes to *movilizar really to the Council goes to be the agreement that have closed recently with the Americans, is to say, the agreement that the Americans will be able to control #if in *Europa fulfil  the hygienic standards that also *nosotros expect of *ellos.
In consequence, gentleman President, insist especially in the proposal taken by our Group that the Parliament believes a provisional commission that occupy  in group of #all the subjects related with the security of the foods and with the public health, and no only of partial details.
I have to *decirles, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President, that *me cheered with the measures that finish to announce *ustedes, but yes that it wanted to *recordarles that #some of these measures in fact were proposed by the European Parliament, takes already time, from the conclusion of the Commission of investigation on the crazy cows.
But, finally, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President, *me #would enjoy to underline, to the equal that our colleagues, that never will be able to resolve the problem of the security of the feeding #if we do not begin to think in a drastic *replanteamiento of our agriculture, of our alimentary production.
On the other hand, I have to say that for my is totally inadmissible that in this crisis of dioxins the union of agriculturalists #belgian deny  to collaborate in the agricultural restructuring and in the reduction of the census grazier in *Bélgica.
#Many of the ingredients are identical (practices *displicentes and even despicable in the preparation of #some alimentary products of animal origin in a world of agriculture intensive and panic and deception in #some of the States members affected *cuando discovers  initially the origin of the pollution)
Thus, plead by the constitution of a commission of investigation parliamentary temporary, attendant to supervise that they put  on the table #all the problems and study  #all the group of the educations that have to take out.
I want to stand out that to this grave crisis of health is facing up  with instruments that were conceived for other goals tied to the Common Agricultural Politics, as it is the Permanent Veterinary Committee allocated to understand of the animal health in himself/hisself same.
Lady Speaker, there #would be *peido the this morning early word in the approval of the Record #if it had known that the annex 3 had not delivered by our seats.
I think, for example, in the fault of transparency of the part of the #belgian Government, that took in alerting to the European Commission, #as well as to the fault of information of the consumers.
In consequence, *le pray that the Table elucidate and treat #this with the greater celerity, as of this luck go in in the pause of summer with a totally garbled situation regarding the delegations and #this do not has to *suceder in this Parliament.
Fine to the French Committee Organiser *equivale to deprive to the football of base and to the promotion of this sport of some bottoms for *ingresarlos in the arks of the European Commission.
With occasion of the Glass of the World of 1998, of the two millions of entrances sold, the greater part of #the same was directly managed by the International Federation of Football, that sent contingents to the 203 national associations of football, reserving a greater percentage for the 24 countries classified, among the that it found  the Realm Joined.
Finally, in chamber place, is normal that, regarding a popular sport and to a country organiser that invested nine *millardos of frank in this event, procure  that the inhabitants of the country organiser approve and take part in the event, it that also constitutes a key element of the hit.
Already I said ten minutes before it took part the Mr. *Ford that the #belgian organisers and Dutches of the championship of *Europa have put  in contact with the Commission and that will not put  to the sale neither an alone entrance of discriminatory mood.
#This is a debate to watch to forward, to the future of the European Union and to strengthen his institutions and, in particular, the European Commission, #whose central paper in the #european construction nobody #can put in cloth of trial.
The modernisation and the reform are, therefore, necessary and it is necessary *llevarlas to cape #if we want that the Commission #can, no only exercise his basic paper of guardian of the Treaties, but also of *impulsora of the process of taking of decisions and of correct agent of the programs and projects that  *le attribute.
In reality has occurred *algo that consider very important -and in this sense create to have understood also very well to my predecessor in the use of the word-: it is precise to extract the consequences of the errors and of the bad performance of the Commission.
It says that neither the Institutions neither the budgetary authorities gave  has rapidity of a series of irregularities neither acted in the most correct way and wiser to avert the consequences that there was.
The Committee of Experts Independent advanced the arguments to establish a committee for the rules of the public life in the #european field.
President, the key words of the second inform here presented are subjects like the subsidiariness, the delegation of competitions and the importance of the independent fight against the fraud.
The grade of care with that we treat this symbol #can determine to a large extent recover the confidence of the citizens. We will watch that the Commission, and especially the Mr. *Kinnock, make the promises that took in the audiences regarding the Mr. Go *Buitenen.
The Commission, to end of accounts, has acted in #a lot of points. But in the case of the *EEB only has acted by pressure, also has acted in these questions only by the pressure of the public opinion.
In the procedures made up to now, #many of the Commissioners designated have had the friendliness to promise in advance a statute of reforms for his own fields and have alluded to his commitments with concrete politics.
The 350 millions of persons that constitute the association of the European Union will not feel  appreciated to the European Parliament neither to the European Commission #if the public opinion considers that it exists *algún type of irritation in the relations that keep.
And memory that *cuando was president of the #italian Council *le was withdrawn the confidence by the Parliament, even by those political strengths that changing of jacket -veto to know with how expensive and with how value- are had to vote to his favour, after having voted in his against in Blunt.
In this context, gentleman President of the Commission, *permítame that signal that in the audiences #some members of his Commission still did not seem to have given this step to access to the condition of Commissioners #european.
In it that concerns to the oral turn, has been a work and a colossal effort so much for the members of the Parliament as for the commissioners proposed and workers so much of the Commission as of the Parliament.
*Permítame Say of step that believe that these auditions, of this form, that push to the commissioners candidates to adopt commitments that his villages #would not approve, introduce to my trial a real distortion in the loyalty of the procedures.
*Me Allow to take this observation to mood of warning because the renewal of the confidence that *usted same has asked with reason, gentleman *Prodi, also depends of course that it head *usted a Commission that #can make his free work of #such objections and that has to differentiate  of his ancestor precisely in this look.
We have listened with attention the repeated statements of the President and without prejudices the auditions of the members of the Commission, and #this *nos has allowed to appreciate a commitment that poses a different relation among the Commission and the Parliament.
Today *nos find in the back stage to the euro and, as it says the President, in a stage of reflation, without embargo, the massive unemployment is the conviction of this #orthodox politics.
Thus, the Party *Independentista of the Realm Joined pleads by the withdrawal of our country of the European Union through the *revocación of the constitutive Record of the European Communities that so *equivocadamente subscribed the Prime minister *Heath in 1972.
#This are, lady Speaker, *señorías, the reasons by the that appeal to the prudence of the Assembly, to his moderation and especially to the respect by the rights of the minorities by the #which, it is necessary to say it, up to now #this had not honoured  especially.
There was not reaction to his reiterated and clear answers to #the same question, and repeated  until the nausea subjects that affect to the #belgian inner politics and that at all have to see with the future charge of the Mr. *Busquin, had account that #this is a multilingual Assembly.
In the points 3 and 5 (to), (*b) of our resolution remains clear that #if the Parliament loses the confidence in a commissioner, has to be sufficient with that there #be simple majority to ask to the president, Mr. *Prodi, the resignation of the commissioner in question.
*Yo Have present that, in his quality of President designated of the Commission, already has accepted *usted #some fundamental political requirements that *le pose, with the end to take possible the application of the individual responsibility.
In this region, without embargo, find  the most extensive borders among the countries that have requested the adhesion to the Union, #as well as the only border with the big #european state of *Rusia.
The report of the independent group of experts indicates that the structures of the European Union and the Commission have been garbled and *desorganizadas during years concerning the relations to be able to and of the responsibility.
We have made a good beginning with the audition, and after the vote of morning, allow that the progressive strengths of this Assembly collaborate with the Commission to provide to the population of *Europa it that wishes.
*Usted Deserves the praise of this Parliament by the work that has made in the budgetary fields and especially in #some of the fields in the that has tried to change the things in the breast of the Commission.
In the agreement *interinstitucional declares  that before surpassing the frames of finance it is necessary to look for other forms to have the finance and like this the Council has acted according to his own point of sight.
Gentleman President, *yo only wanted to *preguntarle to the lady Minister #if it has considered  the possibility to include to the International Monetary Bottom in the quoted conversations on the financial resources for *Timor oriental, *Turquía and *Kosovo, so that #all the weight do not have to *recaer exclusively on *nosotros.
In the first place, it is precise to develop great strategies that allow to control the migratory flows without putting to proof the capacity of integration of the States members and the citizens and help to avert the apparition of conflicts social.
On the other hand, the increase of the cooperation among the States members *nos forces to examine the rights of the citizens from a point of sight wider that the of the national states.
And to follow applying these principles, is important that the Parliament have an equal representation to the of the Council to the hour to decide on the fundamental rights of the citizens.
Well it is that there #be a temporary diet of protection, but only in exceptional circumstances and on condition that it was not a diet that deny the right to the individual examination of the appeals of asylum.
#If the Commission goes to adopt this type of doctrine in the sphere of the offence and of the drugs, etc., #which goes to be the future of this European Union?
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the goal of the European Council of *Tampere -as it remembered  here in an extraordinary council- is the to determine the political orientations and the priorities in matter of creation of the zones of freedom, security and justice.
And like the participation of the national Parliaments in the process limits  to the presence of representatives individual neither is represented the plurality of the political tendencies.
It fits to remember here the important paper of the operation *UNAMET of the UN and give the thanks to his personnel by this tireless work that took possible the organisation of a referendum in some very difficult circumstances.
The Mrs. #Emma *Bonino goes to explain why, in name of the political affinity of #that that believe in the parliaments, the democracy, in the Right and that abhor the *partitocracia, the bureaucracy and the falsity, are not voting neither go to vote.
But it wanted to take advantage of also this explanation of vote for *referirme to the parallel resolution that groups varied commitments contracted by the Commission *Prodi in spheres in #a lot of technical cases, but important, related with the code of behaviour, the ethical and the transparency.
But, especially, there #be a thing that *usted #can take in favour of our peace, and this thing is *propiciar the respect to the historical rights of the Basques, among the *cuales is the fiscal sovereignty, like the has any #another Been member of the EU.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, our negative vote to the nomination of the new Commission by the rest of the current mandate bases  #among others arguments in the fact that it houses to four #ex commissioners that formed part of a school organ that saw  forced to resign by bad management.
The provision with half inks of #some of the candidates, apparently still reluctant *cuando of it that treats  is to mention the *Europa social or the employment, or even the audition very little *convincente of the Mrs. Palace, do not have to hide an impression of group as a whole satisfactory.
To difference of his ancestor *Helmut *Kohl, that five years ago accepted the proposal of the opposition for the Commission -to me *me cost to vote by *Monika *Wulf-*Mathies in 1994-, *Schröder did not show  had to take into account to the current opposition *CDU/*CSU, by more that won the #european elections in *Alemania.
The Commission also recognises that the reallocation of this sum is not possible already in the category 4, but that says that it is necessary to take an effort *extensivo to a reallocation in the group of the budget.
#All know that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee had a common organisational structure, the *SOC, but that, as a result of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and his put in operation, decided  that it suppressed  this common organisational structure.
The proposal treats of the detour of some credits of commitment by value of 137 millions of euros. 30 millions of *ellos allocate  to *Turquía, especially to the actions of help for the provisional accommodation of face to the winter, is to say, helps of emergency.
And even more: the European Union finishes to decree an embargo of material military during four months to the #indonesian. ?How they are four months after *veinticuatro years of compulsive sale of armament to Indonesian, knowing as it knew  the genocide that there was takes *veinticuatro years in *Timor?
But #if it did not modifies his politics, will leave to find partners in *Europa while the managers of the current situation continue in the power, already was in the Army, the Parliament or the Government.
#If they do not detain  the slaughterings, also in other regions, and #if the #indonesian Government do not offers a protection, our opinion is that the Nations Joined will have to happen to the action also in #that other regions of Indonesian.
To the debt that have from takes *veinticuatro years with *Timor Oriental, adds  the fact that in these days take #any demonstration in favour of *Timor Oriental, without embargo, do not takes  in account the political hypothesis that, with #everything, will have to happen once again by the fact of *implorar to the States Joined the possibility of a military intervention.
Besides, this article also affirms that the politics of the Union in this look do not influences in the special characteristics of the politics of security and defence of the States members.
Our main goal is the abolition of the capital pity, but as among the countries that the apply find  states of #a lot of weight, the freezing of the relations do not presents  like a fine solution.
Gentleman President, the Council is conscious that the countries with #a lot of coastal extension are responsible to a large extent of the security of the navigation and of the defence of the maritime environment, so they have to fulfil the norms that have regulated  to the *respecto.
So much in his quality of President in exercise of the European Union, as to national level, *Finlandia do not supports the release of the politics in matter of drugs and neither the possibility to legalise some substances.
Without embargo, it is necessary to take in account that in the conversations to the *respecto has taken  evident that #a lot of countries, especially the countries in roads of development, fear that the Union demand determined labour norms with the intention to take impossible the imports from these countries.
The Mr. *Korakas already *nos has taken to know that it considers that they #would not have to have been *reagrupadas, but like this has decided  and *yo entrust in the skill of the answers of the President in exercise of the Council so that the two have the appropriate answer.
For *nosotros the structure that  *nos proposes -and the Court of Accounts shares our worries- presents a serious danger of *desmembramiento of the administrative authority of the Commission, in benefit of some managerial personnel *intergubernamental, that #can not accept.
Like this as, it #would wish simply that *reflexionáramos on the autonomous structures of decision in *Pristina, that #would give to the population the power to decide with *nosotros the works that have to be undertaken, and that did not exist #one "*superburocratización" in *Bruselas, tied to the logic of operation of the European Union.
#All the efforts for elevating the education and the medical assistance to an acceptable level, by very valuable that in himself/hisself same are, have not been able to solve the problem of the refugees.
(IN) Gentleman President, is for me a pleasure comment the fact that in this brief debate have had three inaugural interventions, included the of the Mrs. *Schröder that, to his 21 years, is the youngest deputy to this Parliament.
It costs to believe that in the fifteen countries of the European Union lose  swim less that 7.500 lives simply because the persons do not use the belt of security in the leading seats and in the rear seats.
In the future, the European Parliament will not allow that other institutions of the EU recommend any type or form of reduction in the available budgets for the campaigns of security *vial.
There are difficulties of #the same type in the parliamentary control, #whose consequence is that it was increasingly *incontrolable the action of the police and of the secret services and the projects in the sector of the public security.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, in the moment in that we say with the new Commission that is precise to give a main paper to the European Parliament, is natural that to #the same time have to think  in the relaunching of the external politics of the own Parliament.
Thus *me #would enjoy that the new Commission - and ask it  now to the Commissioner *Kinnock - make a general evaluation of the efficiency of the program *TACIS and afterwards *nos report on how think to improve the program for the budget of the year 2000, so that we #can vote with greater confidence in favour of the program *TACIS.
*Georgios *Papandreou, minister of External Subjects of #Grecia and the Mr. *Tzem, the one who has #the same charge in *Turquía, have decided that it include  the subject of the collaboration *heleno - #turkish for the fight against the natural catastrophes in the diary of the dialogue of *Atenas and *Ankara.
The official statements of *Moscú in the sense that neither the crisis in *Daguestán neither the attempts of *Moscú will serve of pretext to declare the state of exception and, therefore, postpone the next elections to the *Duma, have reassured to the Commission.
I comprise that we #would have to argue with the Council of *Europa to try negotiate an arrangement with *ellos, but has to *usted recognise that technically no longer have access to this building because we already have left to pay the rent.
Then *me seems enough *penoso that the #french legislation give apparently *tanta importance to the artistic property of some impossible corridors, lights and stairs but for example no to the energetic saving, whereas in my country at least #one third part of the new houses have of solar signposts.
I want to add my voice to the numerous comments that already have taken  and signal that I find totally incomprehensible that are here in the first place, *cuando have offices, halls of meeting and houses very fine in *Bruselas, and that it is absurd that #all the "Euro-circus" have had to be *penosamente moved to *Estrasburgo for three or maybe four days to the month (pardon, five days this week).
*Me #Would enjoy to say, although as #many of the deputies also regret the circus of trips among the diverse headquarters of the European Parliament, that am fully satisfied with the design of my office of *Estrasburgo, especially #if, as *me promised, installs  a cupboard with bolt.
Estimated colleagues, #that of *ustedes that they have assisted to this Parliament during the last years know that in this Assembly are very #few the that, as *yo *cuando chaired the last commission for *EEB, have devoted  so acutely and -almost #can say- with so much enthusiasm, to the question of the security of the meat, especially the of the meat of *vacuno #british.
The solutions  *reconducen to three very concrete fronts: 1) the consumer; 2) a new agricultural revolution and environmental; 3) a precise political indication that it has to come precisely of the community organs.
The crisis of the crazy cows and the #news of the last months have put of self-evident that the alimentary security deserves a deal *prioritario, although they also have shown that only *nos agree of *ello in difficult moments.
*Me Cheer especially that today it find  *usted here personally for *informarnos on a so important subject, although I believe that the time passed from the nomination of the new European Commission is too much little so that, so much *usted like the competent commissioners, have been able to *ultimar concrete proposals.
#If in the States Joined the *incumplimiento of the laws on the environment #can sanction with the publication of the name of the company and of the director of #the same, do not see why *nosotros in the Low Countries #can not take *algo similar.
Without embargo, #can not but *mostrarme *perplejo and concerned so much in my quality of scientist as of politician in front of the conclusions to the that has got  in this decision, #this is, fix a maximum ceiling tolerated of *BPC of 200 *nanogramos of fat so much in the *volatería as in the meats of pig and his derivatives.
Lady Speaker, the recent successive crises in the field of the alimentary security have put of self-evident of the mood more *convincente that the protection of the public health has to be *prioritaria in front of #all the other politics.
It results #worthy of *beneplácito and *tranquilizador that from the same beginning the new Commissioner, Mr. *Byrne, have shown an unambiguous commitment with the recovery of the confidence of the consumers in the alimentary industry.
I expect that #this was the main priority of our works of the next week in the context *ACP and that convert , gentleman Commissioner, in a proposal that the Commission and the European Union take #his, so as to that at last we #can *hacernos charge of this problem seriously.
In less of two decades, a very short period in the world of the illnesses *infecciosas, the AIDS has been the main cause of death in the *África *subsahariana.
Given the different nature of these bottoms with regard to the normal projects in the *cuales contributes  money to the budget, *me fear that in this case this idea of control budgetary, that #all accept and that #all defend, is not exactly applicable.
The formula that *yo *les #would propose now and to the that *me #can engage is that before it produce  this type of payments inform , for example, to the presidents of the commissions involved in these subjects, of #such form that the Parliament have knowledge of #the same without that, by this duty of confidentiality that have to keep in #some subjects,  *nos pose #any difficulty.
We have to introduce a consistent specific solution in modifying, by the road of a concrete decision of the Council, the financial perspectives for a concrete point?
Sure enough, in the measure in that *ello was possible have to exceed the stadium of the statements of intentions so frequently heard in the course of the last decade to find forceful concrete applications #if we wish to reach this goal, to end of modest accounts, of a 12 %.
Gentleman President, wanted to congratulate to the Mr. *Langen, the speaker, by his report on the approval of the program *multianual for the promotion of the sources of energy renewable in the Community, *Altener *II.
In reality, #can that not even it assign  this quantity, since the amendment *n1 5 to the section 3 (new) of the article 1 says, in reality, that #can reduce  the quantity of bottoms, #if it is not compatible with the financial perspective for the period that it treats .
#Many will be small plans, to scale of the community, specific of the place, already use the wind, the waves, the solar energy, the combination of heat and electricity or even the biomass.
It wanted to reiterate my gratitude and say that I expect that in the last review #can find the definite formula and, therefore, give a push to the program *ALTENER, that is a clear impulse to the utilisation of the renewable energies in *Europa.
Regarding the amendment 4, exists a clear need of complementarity, as we said takes a moment when talking of the program *ALTENER, regarding the actions in the field of the energetic efficiency and of the renewable energies.
But it is not less true that there #be had moments in that we appreciate, by part of the #european negotiators #as well as by part of #such or *cual Been member, behaviours excessively bureaucratic, defensive and until *cicateros, as also *nos concerned to perceive sometimes in our #south african speakers a tendency to give course backwards and to reopen questions that seemed already enclosed, with it that the process  *demoraba more and more.
The decision of the World-wide Economic Summit, celebrated in Colony this year, to cancel 100.000 millions of dollars of debt of the *tercer world was important to #that *respecto and has to *surtir an effect catalyst for the adoption of other measures by #all the countries of the EU and no only #one #few.
On the other hand, the signatories of the agreement do not hide it and say that "the relative disposals to the cooperation pretend to facilitate the restructuring and the modernisation of the #south african industry and boost his competitiveness" .
By it other, have resulted divided the interpretations and the opinions of the European Parliament that wanted an agreement that  *acercara more to the conditions of the Agreement of *Lomé, and of the Commission that has pronounced  by an adhesion, say, conditioned.
And, especially, that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of Subjects General of July of this year,  *subscribe the specific agreement on wines before the provisional entrance in vigour of the commercial part of the agreement, foreseen for January.
While it do not apply  the agreement on wines and liquors, will not go in in vigour neither the special financial assistance -15 millions of euros- to the sector *vinícola #south african neither the contingent of wine free of rights of 32 millions of litres.
Neither it has agreed  still that the EU liberalise the imports of products car #south african in the term of three years, as it seems to announce the report in the page 9.
During the next weeks and months, will follow closely the preparatory process with seen to this date to end to watch by that #all the important commercial #granting of the EU to *Sudáfrica initiate his career in this date agreed.
It #can indicate the Commission how actions #can undertake to find urgently bottoms (for example, *MCA remaining, other community programs), with the end that in #all the #greek territory give  an immediate preventive control of the *adecuación static of public buildings, schools, hospitals, etc., #as well as of places of work in mass, like factories, so that it verify  the resistance of the *edificaciones in question in cases of seisms of big magnitude?
With the Mrs. *Diamantopoulou have communicated this same afternoon, to the Commission, the actions that are possible in the frame of the Structural Bottoms to support to #Grecia and help to the reconstruction, to the repair.
The complicated access to the valley of the *Panshir, the extremely explosive situation and the accused political sensitivity, that characterise the situation in the place, demand an intervention that has to be coordinated among the diverse humanitarian organisations to end to avert failures of estimate and bad decisions.
I believe that precisely the quantity of the community humanitarian help to Serbian underlines clearly our wish to bet in favour of the population and up to now have been able to identify clear needs and justified of humanitarian character.
The greater part of the pupils goes to have or already has a direction of post electronic own, the majority of the that work already the have and there are #a lot of courses on Internet for pensioners.
The index of abstention registered in the recent elections to the European Parliament has shown, without embargo, that the citizens are not sensitised in the measure that #would be convenient in relation with the EU and his goals.
Second -and #this *reviste an immense importance and examined it in the Nations Joined with the General Secretary and the General Secretary Attach-, the question of the finance of the civil administration to short and half term.
Also I am convinced that no only are forced to support to the democratic circles and his modest hits by moral reasons but also because #one *Turquía democratic that #can solve his problems in *Turquía will be of positive for the inner security of the European Union.
Thus -independently of #which was the calendar and the exact procedure to follow- in *Helsinki it is necessary to command a signal of hope to the persons of origin #turkish and *kurdo #as well as to the democracy in *Turquía.
Had account of the importance *geoestratégica of *Turquía and of the paper that always has exerted in the defence of *Europa, believe, finally, that also #would suit to include in the agenda of the works the questions of politics external and of security.
Gentleman President, the Roman Mr. *Prodi declared in his speech of presentation to the European Parliament that have by in front a period of enlargement of twenty or even thirty years, during the *cual the number of members will rise to *veinticinco, or perhaps to more.
#If it accepted  to *Turquía in quality of country candidate to the adhesion, the criteria of *Copenhague #would suppose a species of path or course for the future evolution of the country and #would contribute to orient the development of #the same to the values that here represent.
I believe that *cuando take  perceivable that this approach to the western values *le offers to *Turquía better possibilities of economic development and more field of political action, is possible that the #islamic countries take to *Turquía like positive example and that consolidate  of this form the development of the neighbouring zones.
The cooperation among *Europa and *Turquía #can be an example *alentador and hopeful on how cultures that are neighbouring and that coexist #can find a conjoint road to reach the peace, the democracy and the State of right to the equal that opportunities of welfare for his inhabitants.
In this sense, pray to the European Parliament that *nos concede the possibility to talk of a credible mood with *Turquía, to contribute *creíblemente to that produce  changes in *Turquía and here includes  that we fulfil also really the commitments contracted in front of this country.
The #finnish Presidency has considered the process of peace in Orient Next like #one of the most important subjects of the common politics of the Union in matter of external subjects and security.
We recognise the crucial paper of the States Joined that have struggled during so much time and with *tanta tenacity to carry the peace to this afflicted region; and *rindo a warm homage to said efforts - for example, to the capacity negotiator and to the determination of the Secretary of State.
In this sense, the President *Arafat and the Prime minister #Barak already have signed the memorandum for the application of the Agreement of *Wye *River and restart the negotiations on the final situation.
I receive with satisfaction the statement of the Palestinian Authority, in the sense that it will adopt measured to combat the terrorism, whereas the Prime minister #Barak has recognised with informal character that will try to limit the expansion of the settlements.
#If embargo, to the hour to defend the right of self-determination, consider that #all the parts have to be exhorted to employ  in depth especially against the terrorism to end to guarantee the security of the villages.
Like this, serious obstacles to reach a just peace, like the constant establishment of #jewish colonies in #palestinian territories or the contempt of it that *Jerusalén #This means for Palestinians, #arab and Muslims in general, have filled of difficulties the path to the peace, concept that do not has to be defined like the mere absence of war.
The European Parliament - the only institution of the EU that it is chosen directly by the citizens - neither was consulted in any moment during the two years that lasted the negotiations on the content of the Agreement.
According to the French, is evident that #if still they register  every year 3.000 cases of "crazy cows" in the Realm Joined, in spite of #all the measures of caution that have been taken, follows existing, in the transmission of this illness, *algún element that still has not been able to  explain.
Thus, this precise country of a maximum support, as the new Government has shown how #can provide  stability with a #european spirit in #one of the most dangerous regions of the world.
After the celebration of this meeting, will inform immediately on the details of the there taken resolutions and will communicate the posture of the Council to the Commissions of Industry, External Trade, Investigation and Energy.
In the agricultural plane, the orientations of the European Council of *Berlín on the Diary 2000 *nos offer a solid base to make, in matter of liberalisation, compatible progresses with the agricultural model European.
But there #be also #some other open questions in the cooperation among the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, by #another, in the frame of the Round of the #Millenium.
Thus, it is necessary to create for the countries in roads of development some better conditions of access to the market suppressing to #the same time #all the subventions to the export of the EU for the agricultural products.
*Me Seems shameful that have had to accept that #a lot of countries in roads of development and that take part *contractualmente in the frame of this debate and that see  especially affected, #can not be seated not even to the table negotiator by financial reasons and that the participation of the public opinion was so small.
This model, based in the community preference, guarantees the quality of the products, the alimentary security, the survival and the expansion of our agricultural sectors and *agroalimentario.
Regarding the sanitary and educational problems, do not think and do not wish to put in cloth of objective trial of public politics in these fields to title of it that proposes  in the field of the liberalisation of services in the next Round.
East run over has to see like an attack against the freedom of expression and the boundless right of the citizens to the culture, that do not has *parangón neither in the EU neither in the other democratic countries.
The Council considers that they are the States members the that they have to commission to mitigate the social consequences of the suppression of the free sales of taxes and the problems that #can arise in the border zones.
In the cases in that the Presidency have had the intention to celebrate public meetings, but have not reached it, how States members are the that, with his opposition, have put fetters to the transparency?
Gentleman President, are assisting once again to a conflict of interests, #can call it like this, among the principle of integrity territorial of the States and the principle of self-determination of the villages.
And it is precise and urgent that take #all the measures to our disposal so that they reestablish  the human rights in the region, so that the refugees have #all the humanitarian help that require and so that, finally, #can return to his homes because it has reestablished  the peace.
Really it is to sin by excess of credulity the imagine that the #british Government #can not have interrupted the delivery of these planes of fight that got to his destination #one those that hours before the #indonesian strengths killed at least to five demonstrators in *Yakarta.
And I ask to the Commission that employ  in depth to apply these goals, with the end to convert to *Europa in the world-wide homeland of the political action against the pity of death.
To #the same time, this Parliament has to give his decided support to this action and watch so that in the future reach  compulsory agreements in Gin in #all the situations that have relation with the human rights, in addition to fulfilling the resolution that expect that it approve  in New *York in the autumn.
Like this as, it is also a way to reaffirm, in this sense, the importance to legislate definitively, to the level of the Nations Joined, on the abolition of the pity of death.
I have listened the debate of today and consider it like a very wise contribution and very *sobria to the achievement of these hopes that, to my trial, #can make  with it that *yo #would designate a "soft landing" for Indonesian and for #all the populations of Indonesian.
No *me remains more remedy that say today that we also have to leave to throw the fault to the workers, workers to those who the radiation has sentenced to death like consequence of the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry.
But in *Tokaimura, the own #japanese authorities have recognised that the procedures of security, so much in the plant of conversion as in the facilities of production of fuel, have not respected .
The orientation to the soft energy and to the sources of energies renewable gives  to know increasingly like the only solution to the energetic problem of the society *postindustrial.
The questions referents to the inspection of the fuel in the plant *MOX of *Sellafield are of the *incumbencia of the national authorities and have been notified to the services of inspection of nuclear facilities of the Realm Joined.
The #irish Government has prepared a Green Book on the sustainable energy that will occupy a special place in our National Plan of Development for the period 2000-2006.
I understand that it is important for the House, is important for the institution of the European Parliament be once again to the height of the demands of the #european citizens, demands that have expressed  of mood very *nítido lately and, of course, during the last #european elections.
Gentleman President, always have been quite skeptical in front of the attitudes *moralistas or police that even boost the complaint, for the *cuales the frauds avert  only through the creation of instruments of control of the increasingly evident persons.
In the present case are in front of a new technological reality and social that #can configure *jurídicamente from the principle by means of a legislation *originariamente #european and with the that to #the same time *nos #can accredit of a special way like #european juridical community.
An ancient applicable example here is that #if the laws of the States members demand simultaneous presence, then will not be possible for a couple marry by means of this type of signatures through the network.
For #many of *nosotros, and *me surprises that the Mrs. *Thors have not mentioned it, #this is a stimulating phenomenon, *igualador and *liberador because the ancient world was dominated by the great centres and the peripheries were in a situation *desventajosa in relation with the centres.
With the directive on the conditions mark for the electronic signature the European Union gives an important step to the elimination of the obstacles to the electronic trade.
Regarding the term, seems reasonable, taking into account the delay that is producing  with this directive, that expand  for the mopeds of 1 January to 1 July 2002, so that there #be a bit of time of adaptation of the industry.
Regarding the called question of the offices of assistance technical, the big reform proposed by the Parliament maybe have not been still sufficiently *ponderada so that it #can make  in the field of the budget for the exercise 2000.
I have noted that also the European Parliament has intention to propose assignments that surpass the maximum limit of the category 4 and thinks to take it so that it was possible to put assignments to disposal of the actions in *Timor Oriental and in *Turquía that need finance and also to concretise the agreement of fishing with *Marruecos.
The Commission *me has entrusted that *les communicate that the Commission goes to propose another solution, that will take in consideration so much the need to establish political priorities like the principle of discipline budgetary.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the relations among the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Commission of Budgets during the works of preparation of the Budget have not developed  never without tensions.
We are had to endow to the Commission of the necessary resources to fund the administrative tasks and of management of #all these projects #if it guarantees  the owed participation of the Parliament in the reflections on the reform.
*Permítanme That remember also it that has manifested the colleague #Perry: the programs *plurianuales, as #SOCRATES and *LIFE, answer in fact to the expectations of the citizens and have to guarantee his quality and *dotarlos of the necessary resources like part of the processes of development and of #european integration.
Also it wanted to give the thanks to #all the members of the different commissions that *nos have taken to get his aspirations and that in his greater part have manifested a big understanding in front of the fact that, *cuando *nos move in a frame limited, although #a lot of things are desirable, no #all are possible.
The Budget of the European Union for the exercise 2000 has a special character, no only because it began to examine it the ancient Parliament and afterwards reached  an Agreement *interinstitucional, that is *vinculante bear *nosotros, in the that we also take part and that accepted  keep after the elections.
Of #the same way that my Group do not defends an imprudent increase of the costs of the Union, more important *nos seems, #if it is necessary, which occurs clearly in this case, use the *margen of increase of costs authorised by the agreements signed among the own States members.
#If #the same budgetary rigour prevails so much in the field of the States as of the Union, #this answers especially here to the claims of #some countries members and know that the first victim of this rigour will be the common agricultural politics.
Therefore, we owe *asegurarnos no only that there #be the owed coherence among the agencies that work on the terrain, but also, lady Speaker of the Council, that not adopting decisions that suppose to spend money pointlessly by a decision of the Council to move to some persons to another place to 100 miles of distance.
No *nos fits the lower doubt that it will be possible to consign new resources for the finance of *Kosovo, but instead consider that other measures -*Turquía, the Agreement of fishing with *Marruecos- have to fund  in the frame of the at present foreseen costs in the Budget.
In effect, the most stood out note of this budget *estriba in the self-evident insufficiency of the assignments to confront determined goals, as in the category *IV, "external Politics and cooperation", is in the that this insufficiency  self-evident of form more evident.
It is the *primer budget that goes to brush the 100 *millardos of euros #if they adopt  the amendments *Bourlanges and, talking of the gentleman *Bourlanges - that it is the financial of "the cabin of the uncle #Jean *Monnet" -, is his *primer inform after the general report, after the of the lady *Dührkop, of the gentleman *Tillich, of the gentleman *Lamassoure or #others.
We have set up an initiative -and want to highlight it very clearly- that it also proposes to look for a flawless solution for the management of the budgetary resources that we have to administer directly from the Parliament, among the *cuales want to stand out in particular the costs of trips.
Gentleman President, the speaker and #some of the orators that *me have preceded already have alluded, obviously, to the that for me is #one of the crucial political elements -#if no the crucial element- of this project of budget.
Since it initiated  the politics of creation of an economic space liberalised to scale world-wide is taking place  a massive transfer of resources of the poor to the rich, so much inside each society as among the States.
I think in the importance to increase the popular base in the activities of the Union and that *nos concentrate in transcendental subjects as, for example, in combating the unemployment and in the enlargement to the new countries candidates.
The humanitarian help for the victims of the war or for the refugees in *Kosovo, for the victims of the earthquakes in *Turquía and for the innocent victims in *Timor Oriental, are obvious requirements that take  to the European Union.
Gentleman President, with this debate the European Parliament has the opportunity to exert of consistent form the affirmation of his will regarding the future of the European Union.
The links among the competent commission regarding the bottom and the Commission of Budgets #would not have to interrupt with the first reading of the Parliament, after the *cual #can pass still *algún time until the subject remain finally resolved.
Without embargo, #would not have to forget the goals of the European Union. The most important is the efficiency of our budgetary lines from the point of sight of the employment.
The Commission will propose, therefore, that use  the three instruments, to know: the redistribution of the credits, the instrument of the clause of flexibility and a review of the financial perspectives.
Therefore, *le will ask, lady Commissioner, that have to well, with his colleagues and in the terms that consider appropriate, concretise the commitments that finishes to assume, with the end that we #can vote the Thursday with total knowledge of cause and on the base of commitments clear that exclude any misunderstanding among *nosotros.
By the contrary, the *SEBC has to have a vision of #all the zone of the euro when taking his assessment of the economic situation in general and of the panorama of stability of the prices in particular.
In the first place, in some surroundings of stability of the prices, the mechanism of the market will assign the resources of form more effective to his more productive uses.
The clear division among the competitions of performance that finish to describe reinforces the credibility of the monetary and economic politics in *Europa, increases the transparency and facilitates the democratic responsibility.
Besides, in operations that save relation with the politics of the only coin, the organs of taking of decisions of the *SEBC will occupy  to value #if the planned operations with compatible with the goal of the monetary stability.
It #can that it reach his goals of stability of the prices, but without opening will not be clear #if said goal has reached  by design and, therefore, will be able to repeat  in the future, or by a lucky accident that it #can demand then the introduction of #any improves in his methods of work.
In a democratic juridical order, the institutional and political independence of an institution only is possible #if to #the same time also is guaranteed his *legitimación democratic, and #this demands the transparency of the decisions, but also that #this are comprehensible.
*Yo Have the *convencimiento that the collaboration in a climate of confidence among the #ECB and the Parliament also #can contribute to boost the security and the confidence of the public opinion.
To avert #this our Group proposes an amendment that calls the attention of the Central Bank European on his mandate that is the to ensure the stability of the prices in the two senses.
Gentleman *Duisenberg, *sucede *usted like this without embargo - although the scarce assistance that today have do not seems to go in the sense of my words - to the emperors and to the popes that from #Charlemagne have dreamed with *reunificar our continent by means of the faith or of the strength.
Without place to doubts, the Report *Huhne contains positive elements, especially regarding the appeal to the Central Bank European of greater information on the reasons of the decisions adopted by means of the publication of a succinct record that contain also the opinions *disconformes.
The Central Bank European has made a good work, has won  the confidence of the citizens thanks to the work made in the last months, and like this go to manifest it also in the resolution.
Gentleman President, this *primer annual report of the Central Bank *me gives occasion to take an as a whole positive evaluation of the work made until here by the Central Bank European and of the operation of the zone euro.
Gentleman President, the European Central Bank continuous being an institution that takes decisions of crucial importance for the millions of citizens of the European Union, without being subject to any democratic control and politician.
A sinking of the credibility of the Bank or the belief that #this #would not be had to follow a politics *antiinflacionista at all costs #can have grave economic repercussions in the group of the Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Central Bank European, the annual report of the #ECB shows that the activity of the bank initiated  to good rhythm and that the steps given until this moment go in the correct direction.
It is necessary to remember that, although in the zone of the euro practise  an only monetary politics, follow having eleven economic politics different, #whose coordination *incumbe to the States members, inside the frame established in the Pact of Stability and Growth.
On a long-term basis, the Commission will develop a coherent strategy for the grey zone, is to say, the zone comprised among the humanitarian help and the cooperation to the development more on a long-term basis and directed to the future.
#Many have asked as a result of our work in this field -no only THROW and the humanitarian help- #if  "we do not put the car in front of the horse" when insisting in celebrating quickly some elections.
While the military capacity of the violent increases, in big part thanks to the moneys of the drug trafficking, the civil population asks that  *le apart from the conflict, as it has understood that *ella is now the big affected and are his fundamental rights the that they violate  day after day.
I have said and I want to repeat it in front of *ustedes: today the drug trafficking is the worst and the *primer enemy of the peace, and #this will not reach  totally without the dismantlement of the organisations that devote  to the damned business of the drug and without that we reach alternative and economic sustainable solutions and socially.
*Ustedes Represent to those who have opted by the life, by the peace and by the defence of the human rights; *ustedes are expression of those who believe in the democracy, in the freedom and in a healthy environment for the next generations.
The lessons of *Bosnia and *Kosovo reinforce our conviction that it suits to persist in the explanation of our intentions, as we expect that *suceda until the end of the common year, in particular in the frame of the preparation of the budget for the year 2000.
Wail that have not been so frequent the presence of the Council in the commissions of the Parliament, because *ello *nos had helped to be able to debate and *conocernos better and to be able to advance jointly.
The Council of Colony entrusted to the #finnish Government, like titling of the Presidency, establish the necessary conditions for the execution of this project to time for the Summit of *Tampere.
Like president of the Commission of Subjects Juridical and Rights of the Citizens, wanted to suggest to the President in exercise that concede  greater recognition to the paper of this Parliament to the hour to treat with the citizens.
A space of justice will give form and foundation to the *tercer *pilar and will allow a more intense fight against the delinquency organised in #all his tragic facets: traffic of women and of boys, pederasty, corruption of minors, production and traffic of drugs, exploitation of the prostitution, boosted #all *ellos by the illegal immigration in these last times.
Wail that already have separated  to the associations of defence of the human and antiracist rights, #as well as the social speakers, of the preparation of this letter.
In #all these fields, the Commission #would have to take the initiative to end to reach a more complete configuration of the diary, and the Parliament has to prepare to exert the paper that *le suits.
Nevertheless, the change has to get no only for the three pending subjects of *Amsterdam, the extension of the vote by qualified majority, the size of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council.
The *segunda reforms fundamental is the elimination of the national veto of the clauses of cooperation reinforced; and the third will be to concede to the citizenship the right to access directly to the European Court.
It Same is applicable to the article 105 of the Treaty of the *CE, so that the #ECB have the politically established mandate *contractualmente to boost with his monetary politics the growth and the employment.
Of course, when reading it gives  #one explains that they do not mention  neither the dreams, neither the goals, neither the challenges with the that it finds  the European Union of face to the century *XXI; but, at least, they give  #some lines general guidelines related with a series of questions of institutional character that have to be regulated.
The inner circle #would be formed by a #european federation, composed by the States members of the Union that are more advanced in the integration: #that that are members of the NATO and belong also to the zone of the euro.
Tomorrow I will travel to *Kosovo with Gift #Javier Adret to evaluate personally our performance, therefore will have of the opinions of the Parliament to support my clear *convencimiento of the need to set up the Agency it before possible.
I expect that the Parliament comprise that we do not have *escatimado efforts to find a solution of commitment to this subject so extremely important and expect that we #can work with the Council of #such mood that deserve the approval of the Parliament.
The #european delegation of the *PvdA in front of the European Parliament, and #some #others, have encouraged  in the past for reaching this disposal of the Parliament to the adoption of commitments and will continue it taking.
The *SP will continue struggling in the new European Parliament by a just statute, that have a transparent system of diets based in the costs effected and, therefore, agrees with the proposals that the Council has made on this subject.
It is necessary to leave that the systems of protection develop  it more effectively possible through the agents of market, and, simultaneously, it is necessary to procure that it keep  the confidence of the citizens in the possibilities of the digital signature.
In view of this difference of situation, fears much more that the #others the exploitation of his internal conflicts by #such or *cual of the countries members and, to remedy this danger, sees  forced to be two less transparent times.
I have talked with #a lot of persons on the subject and believe that the society #would receive with satisfaction a greater capacity to act against the international delinquency and the crime organised that crosses our borders in proportions every time greater.
This space, that arises linked to the advance of the suppression of the called "inner borders" of the EU and to the strengthening of his "external borders", #can not transform to the EU in a fortress.
It repeats  with frequency, *Señorías: the progress only costs #if it is shared and *eso comports for *nosotros that in a world in constant mutation leave  to take that *recaigan the efforts and essential sacrifices on the employees for afterwards take that the richest and the most powerful benefit  *prioritariamente of the positive effects of said efforts and sacrifices.
His *provocador announcement situates  in the frame of an authentic gangrene that #can not leave that it develop  without reacting, #if we do not want to renounce *nosotros same to control #any of the economic and social development and, therefore, to the ambition to promote, in full *mundialización, a social model European.
It carries  the #sad -palm palm- *Renault, that, when clearing without *miramientos the places of work in *Nissan, satisfies to his shareholders, even to risk to export to the *Japón the image more *detestable of *Europa, no without suppressing, of *carambola, varied thousands of places of work in the own European Union.
Even in the cases in that they exist right in the #european legislation, rights, for example, to be consulted with the owed *antelación on decisions of collective dismissals and other important changes that affect to the lives of the workers, the law do not fulfils  or do not applies  as it is had to.
This violent expression of the contempt of the employees and of his life contradicts fundamentally the goals announced in *pro of the employment, of the social and territorial cohesion and of the social model European.
It has mentioned  the banking sector, that is #one of the problems that go to have in front of *nosotros but, clear, *Europa has a big history and experience in these restructurings, that begin from the textile and naval industry and get until the current industries.
No *escatimaremos efforts to convince to the Congress of the importance that has the Treaty of prohibition total of the nuclear proofs for *nosotros, for the States Joined and for the international efforts directed to the no proliferation.
This irresponsibility has supposed a hard hit for #all the international efforts directed to prevent the diffusion of these arms and plants to the nuclear disarmament in front of a grave crisis.
But the entrance in vigour of this Treaty in the #EE.UU #would have subjected to pressure to regional nuclear powers to adhere  to the Treaty. For example, Indian and *Pakistán, that are establishing his regional balance of the terror, or *Corea of the North or will go, *Irak or #Israel.
The suspicion that have precisely the emergent or regional powers of the *Tercer World that the Treaty of *Non *Proliferation serves in first line to the *aseguramiento of the nuclear reservations of the great and that discriminates to the small, obtains new wings like consequence of the failure of the Treaty on Nuclear Essays in the #EE.UU.
It wanted to say some words on #this and *centrarme later in brief in other two subjects that have dominated our conversations: the application of the Agreement of Association and Cooperation and the enlargement of the European Union to the North.
These obstacles include a certification and some requirements of proofs excessive, #as well as specific problems like the maintenance of the taxes that have to pay the international aerial companies by *sobrevolar *Siberia.
The posture of our Group is that they no longer are sufficient the wishes and the conversations of cabinet, but that the economic help directed to *Rusia has to limit to the humanitarian help and to the of protection of the environment.
*Me Have gathered recently with the Minister of Subjects External *armenio to treat on his worries by the stability in the region *surcaucásica, and also to listen his interests by *Chechenia and the *Cáucaso of the North.
The system of knowledges, the human emotions that only the *Artes and the Letters #can produce, the culture in sum, find  in it deeper of *aquello that the Europeans have in common and, therefore, are the base of the #european citizenship.
To finalise my list of examples, *me will refer to the connection among *Larkhall in *Lanarkshire and a #french program, in the that the youngsters have collaborated in the construction of a lane bike in the south of *Escocia.
Therefore, the reference to the paper of the family believe that it #would have to include in the program Youth of the European Community, that aspires to analyse the factors that boost or hamper the social integration of the youngsters.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the one who wish to inform to know reason is well the Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector #would have to throw a glimpse on the index of any edition of #IRIS, the juridical observatory, for example in the edition of September of 1999.
I understand that this query of the publications of the Observatory, in particular the yearbook and the juridical bulletin #Iris, is an usual practice of the services of the Commission that occupy  of audiovisual subjects.
In the Conference of Presidents celebrated fourteen days ago, the Mr. *Prodi took upsetting precisely in that the EU has to work so that *Turquía fulfil the requirements of *Copenhague and also said that the EU has to open a political dialogue narrower with *Turquía.
In the first reading, the Commission *subscribió the amendments proposed by the Commission of Culture, thing that appreciate to his speaker, directed to encourage the execution of actions preparatory.
Lady Speaker, following the demonstrations of the Mr. *Bourlanges, with the last amendment that have voted have gone further of the *márgenes of the Category 3, which means that #all amendment that do not adjust  to the recommendations of the Commission of Budgets goes to *darnos serious problems.
It is necessary to be speaker to know until how point the rhythm *infernal of this procedure disturbs the general life of the group of the collaborators of the Secretariat of the Commission of Budgets, and believe that it is necessary to be conscious of *ello.
Lo and behold, in #few words, a triple irregularity: they do not exist political parties Europeans; it do not establishes  any public contribution in his favour and the Commission do not has any right to prepare said statute, contrary to the Treaty.
Inside a logic of reduction generalised of the credits awarded to the help to the development, the European Community is and has to continue being the main partner of the most disadvantaged countries.
(THE) So much the preliminary draft of the Commission as especially the project of budget of the EU for the exercise 2000 presented by the Council characterise  by the strict austerity and by the drastic cuts, even in relation with it agreed in the Council of *Berlín.
It exists a clear need to trace a distinction among the subjects of the organs of direction, that are responsibility of the Table, and the subjects that *atañen to the deputies, that are responsibility of the Plenary.
This fact causes intense restlessness on the profusion of arms nuclear, on the climbing *armamentística in determined regions of the world and on the update of the arms of destruction massive.
The last disclosures on the propagation of arms and nuclear heads to third countries that do not constitute nuclear powers, and, of course, with the ignorance of his villages, confer new and hair-raising dimensions to the danger of catastrophe nuclear.
Guarantee specifications of quality and security of the highest grade in the transport of commodities dangerous by railway has to be the main care of #all legislative initiative of the European Union in this sector.
To this *respecto wanted to manifest my gratitude to the President of the Commission, the Mr. *Prodi, by the obstinacy that puts in this subject, *confiriéndole a place *prioritario in the program of government of the Commission.
When remitting the matter *substantiva of the regulation *IFOP to a regulation of application, the Commission took that the fishing went the only sphere in the agricultural and structural sector that did not decide  in the *primer semester of this year.
The opinion expressed on 30 September 1999 by *AFSSA, relative to the lifting of the prohibition of the exports of meat bovine and bovine products *provenientes of the Realm Joined, is *desfavorable because it bases  in arguments related with scientific questions and of control.
The Agreement of #Florencia, to the that got the Bosses of State and of Government of the EU on 21 June 1996, establishes six previous conditions that the Realm Joined has to fulfil before it raise  the prohibition to export meat of bovine.
The #british citizens expect that *Francia respect the #european legislation, and also expect that the European Commission act with decision to finish with the illegal prohibition of the exports of meat of bovine #british.
By the future of the European Union, by the future of our unit in the conversations of November on the world-wide trade, that will celebrate  in *Seattle, need that the two greater commercial partners Europeans resolve these differences.
The French did not pose objections in May, *cuando the International Veterinary Organisation put in practice some less rigorous conditions that the planned by the program of export of the database.
The subsidiariness imposes, as, the urgent need to recognise that the States have the right to go against of #all measure of harmonisation *cuando propose  adopt norms more protective in matter of public health, as also of environment.
Afterwards, some weeks later, the European Commission imposed the embargo and recognised that the #german States had had reason. Without embargo, the European Commission there was, obviously, yielded to a political biology.
I consider, instead, that has to ask to the Commission and to the other competent community Institutions that inform on it made regarding #the same, so as to allow to the Parliament formulate critical assessments that they are *propedéuticas of face to the improvement of the valid community legislation in the matter.
Regarding the inspection, share the opinion of those who have expressed here his wish that the level of control was similar in #all *Europa, alleging that it did not suffices with implanting only a system of control effective in Big *Bretaña.
By #everything *ello, and expecting that, #such as it requests the report of the Mr. *Cunha, the Commission inform to the Parliament of the result of the application of this Protocol, our Group, gentleman President, asks the approval of the Report *Cunha.
Gentleman President, the excellent report of the Mr. *Cunha has deserved my full support, since it takes special upsetting in the principle of the sustainable performance that #can not be missing in a politics of fishing oriented to the future.
In his *dictamen, the Managerial Committee Scientist confirmed that there was not need to examine the decision to raise the prohibition of the exports of meat of bovine of the Realm Joined.
No *le seems that, in principle, the suitable measure in front of a shoot of *EEB -and the path that #would have to have  followed from the *primer moment, from the optics of a preventive protection of the consumers- #would have to be the separation and sacrifice of the herds infected?
It That it wanted to that the Commissioner reiterated so only once again here and now, so that it remain totally clear, is his *convencimiento that this delay goes to be of only some days and that foresees that this process will have concluded, to more take, the Tuesday of the period of sessions of *Estrasburgo and -to be possible- before.
A strength like the of the Popular Party Democrat-European #can not agree with #this, because it aims to the free operation of the market that carries to the free distribution of the incomes, especially from the incomes of the workers.
The Ministers of Inland revenue appear in front of the Commission of Subjects Economic of the European Parliament and the social speakers appear also in front of the European Parliament.
Without embargo, *me see forced to signal that the European Council of Colony delimited very clearly the participants in the properly said dialogue, and the #finnish Presidency did not has more remedy that fulfil this limitation.
These three proposals -the agreement, the directive on the labour day of the persons of the sea and the Agreement of the *OIT- go to go in in vigour to #the same time, around the middle of the year 2002.
In the first place, concerning the workers, the exclusion of the independent workers of the definition will subject to this group to the rigours without palliative of the original directive on the labour day.
His labour modalities depend of factors out of #all control, #such as the climatological conditions and the movements of the fishes, by it that results difficult to imagine how #can apply  the limitations of the labour day in this sector.
Ladies and gentlemen deputies, believe that the most important subject and more difficult for the group of this conciliation, to get to *algún result, goes to be the problem of the directive on the doctors, on the that have talked previously.
It respects  the article of the previous directive, according to the *cual the fishermen that work by own account are subject to the national legislations regarding his permissions and to the election of the conditions of work.
#This will apply  especially to the improvement of the environmental protection and to the limitation of the negative effects of the growth and of the urbanisation in the welfare of the #chinese village.
By means of the scientific and technological cooperation also will be possible to promote the *aprovechamiento of the enormous natural resources of the part *noroccidental of *Rusia, the *cuales will have a big importance in the future economic development, so much of *Rusia as of the Union.
The fault of clarity in the nuclear field and our restlessness in front of this subject #would be really sufficient to formulate a reservation and say, for example, that want that both agreements conclude to #the same time.
With regard to other possible cooperations, have to follow a logical order of priorities, beginning, as it has proposed , by the countries members of the quoted area, is to say, *Paraguay, *Uruguay, *Brasil and Argentinian, and continuing by his countries associated -*Chile, *Bolivia, etc.-, with the *cuales, as #all know, the European Union finds  in a stage of conversations for an association *interregional.
Announcements in the hall of exhibition in the that they mention  the data of #all the models of car that sell  in #the same. Likewise, they have to mention the consumption of fuel and the broadcasts of CO2 *cuando take  advertising on the new cars, also.
A second point to the that has to loan attention in the review is that the Parliament requested that the directive also out of application in the case of the cars of *segunda hand, of the cars of directors and of the vehicles with permission of circulation of a day.
While in *Bonn #others try to evade his responsibility and deny  to reduce the broadcasts of CO2, *nosotros adopt effective instruments, adopt legislative disposals and offer to the consumer the possibility to reduce personally the broadcasts of CO2
The possibilities that involves this approach so only finish to begin to appear in the field quickly *cambiante of the electronic trade, for example in relation with the procedures of resolution of the conflicts in line.
The national markets of the countries candidates will have to integrate in the community without shaken and, in consequence, will be necessary to foresee, in his case, transitory measures by #if said countries were not prepared; without embargo, our goal has to be the of *ayudarles to be prepared from the following day to the of the adhesion.
Likewise, the term that finalises the Thursday of the previous week to the week in that it transacts  the question, since the questions transact  the Tuesday, supposes at all less that eight working days, which exceeds of any interpretation.
The opinion of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities find  added to this Report *nº 2 of the agenda of today.
. (*SV) Gentleman President, the lines guidelines of the employment for the year 1999 take upsetting in that the ideas on equality of opportunities for men and women have to form part of #all the plans of action and measures that propose  in the field of the four *pilares of the strategy of employment of the EU.
The fact that the conditions are complicated remains shown because with frequency our agreement and our convergence in these goals #can finish by *desmoronarse to the hour to define the therapies, the strategies of performance.
No *me seems, without embargo, that the Committee of the Regions take part in the assessment of the performances of the States with a view to tackle politics of employment to scale local that entrust , frequent and exclusively, to the activism and to the will of the social speakers.
So that I believe that they have to be more diligent in the Commission so that, as it says  in my country, "no *le give cat by hare" and to see #if, at last, in the year 2000 have some criteria and some levels to measure *cualitativamente and no only *cuantitativamente our goals, our means and our results.
Of course, it fits to criticise the politics followed until here, especially the actions *nos lacking tenacity, *nos is missing to struggle against the exclusion of the workers of more age, and are ascertaining that in #all the States members, even in *Suecia, the women do not take part the same that the men in the productive field.
Gentleman President, the proposal of the relative Commission to the lines guidelines for the politics of employment in the year 2000 do not introduces any novelty with regard to the previous documents.
The fact to recognise it do not supposes to delete the competitions of the States members, but sustain that, in a more wide and coherent vision of the problematic occupational, #can act  with greater efficiency to resolve #one of the greater problems of our time.
Besides, the approximation of the economic politics of the countries of the zone of the euro, derived of the common monetary politics, makes possible the research of the best models, or was, the called *bench-*marking.
Gentleman President, the report of the Mr. *Menrad *me seems very correct *cuando assigns to the modernisation of the work a fundamental paper to increase the productivity, the competitiveness and, therefore, the employment.
Lady Speaker, wanted to inform to his *Señorías that in fact has suppressed  practically the article 51 of the Regulation that allows to the deputies sign statements written that, in the case that they had been subscribed by the majority of the deputies, transmit  to the Institutions mentioned in the own statements.
Since *me *opongo by principle to the fixation of dip quantitative in the strategy of employment have not given my backrest to the goal to reduce the differences of remunerations in a determined percentage inside five years (amendment 22).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to examine the definite project of agenda established, of compliance with the article 110 of the Regulation, by the Conference of Presidents (in the meeting of the Thursday 11 November).
The ministries of environment have taken  very to chest the proposal of the parliament and now is #ours to have to demand to the industry an equal attitude of firm in relation to the broadcasts of nitrogen.
We have taken great progresses in the last years, regarding the solution of these problems, for example with the systems installed in cars that already have visited 80.000 kilometres and manufactured takes more of five years, to control the length of the squad *anticontaminación.
Gentleman President, in my intervention wanted to underline the fundamental paper exerted by the European Parliament, in particular by the Commission of Rights of the Woman and Equality of Opportunities, in plough to debate today, expect, the definite approval of this program.
There was a very deep debate with the executive Commission especially regarding modification of the juridical foundation and, therefore, to the reduction that have discerned in the proposal in comparison with the proposal *originaria.
For example, it is not violence force to the women, to the mothers of family, to fulfil nocturnal turns in the chains of production for *rentabilizar better the machines and increase the benefits of the shareholders?
Gentleman President, want to give the thanks to the Mrs. *Avilés by this report, as it has put in our hands a tool more to proceed against the violence exerted on the women and the boys, but also, especially, to show how and where takes place the violence.
The Commission already is applying the initiative *Daphne to combat the violence against the teenagers and the boys, and to #this will follow, as we have seen in the previous debate, the program *Daphne 2000-2003.
The States members, in the next review of the Treaties have to adopt a clear legal base on the Treaties of the EU to favour the interests of the boy.
And in place of the solutions *ortopédicas or *represivas, #would be the moment to prefer the preventive solutions, that believe a different familiar context, it that #would allow finally avert individual and social suffering useless and practise a true politics of insertion and of socialisation from the birth.
I believe that the suitable forum for the debate of the perspectives of the consecration of a fundamental right of the boys has to be #the same that for the Letter of the fundamental rights.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the oral question (*B5-0034/1999) of the Mr. *Rocard, in name of the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects, on the information and query of the workers of the European Union.
The European Parliament has approved a series of amendments oriented first of all to specify the modalities and the definition of information and query, especially regarding the moment in that the information has to be transmitted.
With #everything, *me seems that the attempt of *instrumentalizar also in this Plenary a political battle that the left is carrying out in #Italia against the parity of the educational system is absurd and incompatible with the works of this Parliament.
The speaker applies some questionable criteria, for example accuse to the Commission to have  limited to apply the guidelines of the Council.
In his report, the Mrs. *Haug takes well in checking the arbitrary changes introduced *subrepticiamente by the Commission by means of a relative mathematical operation to the maximum limit of own resources.
Characteristic of this reinforcement is the preventive character of the measures proposed, that expresses a new conception and materialises  in a parallel increase of the powers of management of the European Commission.
We go to go in in some very difficult negotiations and in the frame of #such negotiations float again in the air some figures of the that #all are not so convinced that they are really a suitable base.
Now that the sustainable development is a goal of the treaty, also #would be logical that incorporated  an articulate on the energy in the Treaty that facilitate an integral approach of the energy and the environment.
The amendment 3 signals that with the application of the nuclear energy, apart from a possible reduction of the CO2, go in in game other environmental effects, as they are the storage of the radioactive waste.
Until #the same past week, the Commission was had to present a proposal of new community directive that #would establish drastic limitations to the diets of helps national to the renewable energies.
To face up to these challenges and win these contradictions,  precise, as, very fast, #one *concertación to #all the levels, in the States and with the countries candidates, adhere to the countries candidates to the European Union and work in the context of the *Quinto Programs Frame.
In the summit of *Helsinki, that will celebrate  in December, the Bosses of Government will tackle the subject of the integration of the environment and of the durable development in different sectorial politics, and of special way the energy.
*Me Surprises even more the fact that the transports by road remain excluded of the field of application of the Directive that limits the time of work and the reservations manifested on this subject regarding the workers "*off-*shore".
I share also the criterion of *Wallis, my colleague of Group, in the sense that we have to follow advancing, by a part, supporting his amendments and, by #another, expect that the Commissioner discover new possibilities of advance in this matter to the light of the Summit of *Tampere., we Take like example the *litigios by foods.
It #would be easy, for the Court of Justice, contribute a definition to the notion of responsibility parental independently of the existence of a common matrimonial right, it that do not wishes , neither foresees  at present?
It do not fits doubt that *subsistirán important problems, especially the subject of the disparity of the applicable rights to the divorce and to his consequences, but this regulation is only #one first stage and congratulate to the speaker by this initiative.
Also I suit in that, in the case of countries that depend to a large extent of the nuclear head offices for his electricity and energy, is essential that  *escalone the execution of the programs of closing to end to give time so that it have  of substitutive capacity.
I signalled that, #if there #be a derogation that *nos allow to set up the fulfillment of the commitments contracted in May of 1998, #would reach  a global attack against the expropriation of property, no only in Tub, #where the agreement of May of 1998 received attacks very strong.
It is of interest for #all that there #be a derogation of the Title 4, is of interest for #all, included the possible investors, that there #be not a commercial difference that no only frightens off the investment, but that, besides, poisons our global relations.
I have to say that *me inspires #a lot of confidence that #Sergio Scallop of *Mello go to be the administrator of the Nations Joined in *Timor Oriental: it is a person with the that worked closely in my previous charge, in *Hong *Kong, to tackle the problem of the refugees and of the illegal immigrants.
In the valid directive #can find  #all the instruments for a correct management of the nitrogen in the fields and in the hydrographic basins, in what it apply  adequately in #all the zones of agriculture and *ganadería intensive of *Europa.
So that they are not necessary new provisional directives neither the review of the valid; it that takes fault is to increase the pressures to reach his effective application in the vulnerable zones and in the level of the exploitations *agropecuarias.
For the #others seven countries, among the that it finds  #Italia, *nos remains, from the proposals received in my services, for verifying, country by country, that the map of zones proposed correspond sure enough to the group of the criteria of the Regulation of the Structural Bottoms.
As always, this permission demanded determined commitments by part of the company, commitments allocated to guarantee the real recovery of the company and to reduce the repercussions in the competition and inside the only market.
Gentleman President, the Commission knows perfectly the importance that has the reform of the systems of security social of the countries candidates in the context of his adhesion to the EU.
. Lady Speaker, *Señorías, is a big pleasure for me and a big honour appear in front of the Plenary of this Parliament in my new quality of General Secretary of the Council and High Representative of the Union for the External Politics and of Common Security.
Our request, regarding questions of human rights, has obtained an answer that *me *atrevería to describe of *alentadora, with the confirmation that they have  *cursado invitations to the no governmental organisations active in the field of the human rights so that they visit *Argelia.
I create, lady Speaker, *Señorías, that the debate of the Monday revealed likewise that the ministers wish that the Union endow  of the suitable means to evaluate the crises and have of procedures also suitable and clear for the taking of decisions in case that it was necessary to act.
But the Commission yes has the means and the necessary experience to make an important contribution to the no military dimension of the security.
I want to appreciate likewise to the presidents of the other Groups the agreement reached the Thursday of the past week so as to that the European Commission, represented in this occasion by #Chris *Patten, also #can take part in the session of today.
By #this affirm that the Assembly of the Western European Union, that has fulfilled an important paper in the past, has to transfer these tasks to the European Parliament chosen by direct suffrage.
Said #this, want *recalcar again - and fortunately already have taken it other orators - that, in my opinion, the strength of the European Union resides or #would have to reside in the management of the crises and in the prevention of conflicts.
This position is so surprising that *me ask #if *algún Minister has read the amendment and the data, because #this results totally incomprehensible. Unless it was not truth the that #some suspect, #this is, that this position *moralista and *rigorista serves to take out of difficulties to #some great powers no especially interested by the proposal of moratorium.
Of course, like the Europeans do not propose any additional army, the capacity of action autonomous of the EU will limit  mainly to the process of taking of political decisions.
We #can really *permitirnos strategic and financially an endowment by duplicate of personnel and committees, the proliferation of strengths #european and the waste and the confusion to subject to our strengths armed to two operative doctrines and diets of distinct planning?
Unless we correct this look, #all the subject of the External Politics and of Common Security and of an identity of defence #european will not happen to be a fantasy.
*Cuando Begin to *ocuparnos of the crisis of *Bosnia there was a development in the military planning, in the deployment of the strengths -remember that they deployed  60.000 soldiers in *Bosnia-, that was very by in front of the of the civil planning that it #would be necessary to have made.
Among #this figure, for example, the principle of caution, the need that #this define  clearly, to be able to have a definition in the line of the that adopted  in the Conference of River on the Environment and the Development.
It is necessary to improve the transparency of said procedure, with the *cual have had repeatedly difficulties in the past, and #many of the conflicts have been related with looks of the environmental politics, the protection of the consumer and the protection of the animals.
It That, for example, #can not  repeat is that the #european restrictions to the export are classified in the "green box" and, therefore, have to reduce in six years and the #american credits to the export, that have #the same nature exactly, are not subjects to *imposición *restrictiva #any.
The opinion of the Commission of Subjects Social and Employment is unanimous: it is necessary to support very especially the integration in the world-wide economy of the States that fulfil the social and environmental norms fundamental.
. -. (*FR) The program *Daphne, #all *nosotros, the deputies, have wished it, but also #all the organisations, the no governmental and #others, and associations that work in the delicate field of the violence against the boys, the teenagers and the women.
#If we created a #european tax, the Council will lose little by little his means of resistance and go to give a decisive advantage to the institutions that look for an increase of the budget.
They have increased  the retentions until the 25 percent to end to compensate so much to *Bélgica as to the Low Countries by the charge by costs that proceeded of the progressive replacement of the contribution of the VAT by the contribution of the *PNB.
Second, the majority of the persons (and believe that it is also the case in #all the European Union) recognise that it #would be a historical error begin the next century blocking to *Rusia of the #european subjects as we took to beginnings of this century.
Finally it wanted to say that the Mr. *Ivanov has suggested in his conversations *conmigo that it #can be of utility an intensification of the contacts among the European Parliament and the *Duma, included perhaps a visit to *Moscú of a group of representatives of his *Señorías.
Gentleman President, the last weeks have shown, #such as it finishes to expose the orator that *me has preceded, that the dimensions of the conflict of the *Cáucaso are, in fact, considerable wider and #this extends  also to the group of the zone of the sea *Caspio.
In this context, poses  a debate and also a *interrogante of another totally distinct order. The European Parliament always has left clear in #all his resolutions that *Chechenia forms part of the Russian Federation.
*Yo Do not finish to comprise how is possible that a supposed Minister of External Subjects *autodesignado of *Chechenia, that of compliance with the international Right #can not exist, keep an official conversation with the Speaker of the European Parliament.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, gentleman Commissioner, the Liberal Group adopts a positive posture concerning the relative agreement to the reduction of the bilateral commercial barriers that reached the Chinese Sunday and States Joined.
#This do not involves that we are in presence of the perfect market and, precisely by #this, knowing his benefits and his degenerations, have to treat, through agreements like the proposed by the World-wide Organisation of Trade, to create norms and rules with the end of *protegernos of this type of excesses.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, in an increasingly interdependent world, in the that the problems that *nos affect #be to have his causes in #ours *antípodas, are forced to work together with the other countries to manage adequately the resources of the planet, respecting some rules that are common to #all.
But, it #can not occur instead that the diet strengthen  by means of an economic growth that will benefit to the urban minorities but that will create *decenas of millions of new unemployed, without social security, *cuando dismantle  brutally the state factories and simultaneously millions of peasants go to the unemployment by the new competition in agricultural matter?
Second it is precise to confine to the *OMC, limit of strict form his paper and keep out of his field of competitions sectors that put in game the same identity of the societies and that they have to continue depending of the sovereignty of the citizens and of his institutions chosen.
And, from this point of sight, reaffirm here the need of respect of the environmental questions, respect of the consumer, respect of the human rights and the social rights.
Finally, the stake is not a trade without rules, but to the contrary, act of #such way that the formidable growth of the trade serve to the durable development of #all and no to the enrichment *predador of the strongest.
We owe *ocuparnos that there #be spot for the social and ecological looks and for a gradual participation and directed of the countries of the *Tercer World in the world-wide economy in a world with a commercial traffic liberalised.
His approval will be a clear signal regarding our partners, that confirms that the European Union will not conform  with an approach *minimalista, oriented only to an improvement of the access to the market in #some sectors.
The risk of #paralysis of the legislative organs -the Council and the Parliament- and of *inoperatividad of the Commission to apply the legislation is a fundamental problem.
An administration of justice fine and to time constitutes, after all, an essential part of #all Been of Right, and have to procure that in the European Union the essence of the procedure *prejudicial and the juridical protection general continue being guaranteed.
Other proposals that have suggested , #such as the request that the European Parliament take part in the election of the judges and that the competition of the Court of Justice has to extend to the called *tercer *pilar, are being studied.
Finally, it is necessary to reach the introduction of a clear hierarchy of the juridical norms that allow a precise separation among #all the different legislative decisions and the decisions of application.
Alas, neither the two speakers neither the Commission of Subjects Institutional have wanted to accept the amendments of the Commission of Industry relative to the energetic politics and to the *Euratom.
#This is already a firm point that #all will have to take into account. The Parliament and the Commission move  in #the same direction and are equally convinced that the Conference *Intergubernamental do not has to mark a horizon limited, an approach *reductivo, a diary reduced.
Nobody #can neglect the problems of strengthening of the *Europa political and of institutional change that *nos have posed the birth of the euro and of the Central Bank European, the lesson of *Kosovo, the extended aspiration to a space guaranteed of security and of justice, the disenchantment of *demasiados citizen constituents.
As it has remembered the president of our Commission, Mr. *Napolitano, do not treats  to resolve among maximalists and *minimalistas, it will be necessary to be perfectionist, without leaving to be progressive, regarding the future development of the European Union.
At the side of the hit of the Monetary Union -*innegable- is necessary to advance also in the Political Union and in fields that expand the competitions of the European Union to avert the existent asymmetries; *yo #would say the *clamorosas existent asymmetries.
The current method is quite exhausted but, anyway, #would be indispensable that the Council engaged  to take into account the proposals that take in his moment the Commission and the Parliament of way suitable.
In this sense *me add to it that finishes to say . We #would have to include a procedure of review less strict for the *segunda splits of the new configuration of the Treaties, in addition to incorporating a clause on the cooperation reinforced in a *Europa of 27 or 30 countries.
In 1999, the production grew with regard to the previous year more of the 100 by one hundred and has reached the greater volume of #all the times, that estimates  in some 4600 tonnes, and, in part, #this is consequence of the remarkable increase of the surface devoted to the crop of the opium.
As it already has said the author of the question, the activities in *Afganistán see  hampered by the wide base of the government of the country, and, therefore, by the fault of a suitable partner that deserve credibility.
It wanted to ask to the President in exercise of the Council that *me confirm #if the relative information to how country voted in how felt do not facilitates  *cuando the Council issues his communiqués of press at the end of each meeting of the Council.
According to the general program of the Regulation of the Council 793/93 on assessment and control of the risks of substances existent, at present there are three #fireproof products with bromine that are investigating .
Other specific questions that formulate  in this matter also will be of competition of the Commission, that like manager of the community politics, has the tools and the necessary information to give reliable answers and updated.
Of compliance with the article 112 of the Regulation, the Group of the European Socialists and the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers *me have requested the application of the procedure of urgency.
The article 112 of our Regulation remits to the section 1 of the article 60: "the urgency of the debate of a proposal that was object of query to the Parliament, according to the section 1 of the article 60...".
Had explains that the report of the Mr. *Napolitano refers  to a text of character legislative, believe that *nos situate in the frame of the section 1 of the article 60, to the that remits the article 112 of the Regulation.
Step to the minimum norms. A politics of control like the that proposes  here only is acceptable #if #all the countries apply some minimum norms in it that to the processing of the appeals of asylum refers .
It do not exists any elementary norm of juridical security regarding the procedure of register and to the access to the transmission of these data of the that have the States members and the Commission.
#Everything *ello *me carries to think that #some pretend to use the system *Eurodac maybe no exclusively but yes mainly to designate to a Been responsible member, that will have to load with the consequences of the fraud in matter of illegal immigration and asylum, and do not seem to have #a lot of interest in preventing this type of fraud.
It is important that comprise that, to the time that promote a politics of prevention with goals on a long-term basis, will have to exert politics with goals more in the short term, as they are the politics directed to the repression of the drug trafficking and to the therapy and rehabilitation of the *drogodependientes, of #such luck that contribute to that the prevention finish succeeding, or, at least, to that the situation stabilise .
By it that refers  to the reduction of the demand, the programs and the preventive measures for boys and young, instead of centring  exclusively in the illegal drugs, #would have to treat of the addiction in general, with inclusion of looks of the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.
Finally, the *OLAF do not tackles the causes of the corruption, that reside in the suppression of the national borders, it that allows that the money of the drug circulate freely, #as well as the fraud and the financial delinquency.
Second, it has awarded  to the Commission a mandate of negotiations global regarding #all a series of questions, #some of the *cuales are of community competition, but #others, like the services or the investments, are clearly of national competition.
In any case, will be attentive to the way in that the Commission negotiates, and although the tone of this report amended *nos seem still too much liberal, *nosotros, the Greens, *nos will convert in the more *encarnizados defenders of said text, #if the Commissioner *Lamy descended underneath of the recommendations that here have taken .
But I believe that #one of the most important facts in #day of this new round, and that the distinguishes of the previous, is the irruption of the civil society, of the *ONG and of the international public opinion in the debate.
It is of this doubt, on the other hand, of #where arises my worry: the fact that, by not ending in this point, are forced to not respecting commitments very ancient regarding the countries in roads of development, and especially in front of the countries *ACP, to the *cuales the agreements of *Lomé *nos link from twenty years ago.
But it is evident that bear *eso there are other roads, very distinct of the current and of the that trace , it that introduces in the agenda the need of a relative moratorium to the negotiations on the international commercial relations.
On the other hand, nobody prevents to the countries in roads of development that carry out a suitable agricultural politics. It is to say, they #can avert or reduce the import of these cheap products that prejudice his own agriculture by means of the fixation of exactions to the import.
The #european agriculture has suffered, during the years of the Round *Uruguay, the greater decrease of active population that have known never, it that has caused a true *desorganización of the rural world.
For the neutral states and no ranged the tasks of *Petersberg involve the possibility to take part in conflicts and in the handle of crisis and, by this reason, there #be not reason to integrate totally to the *UEO in the European Union.
Like this, the protection of the fundamental rights of the persons that it treat  demands that it do not advance  to the creation of a central system of control of personal data, as, by principle, #any of these persons #can be treated like an individual criminal or suspicious to be it.
The risk of a nuclear war *desatada by mistake was #one of the reasons of the proposal of the Commission of *Camberra in the sense that the nuclear arms have to be prepared for his immediate use.
#Ours *segunda requirement to diminish the risk of war nuclear was that #all the nuclear arms #would have to disassemble of the devices that the transport, to give like this sufficient time to the serious political negotiations.
Although any element of the systems determinants for the security result affected, other systems, specifically #that that transmit information to the operator, #can see affected and his failure #can put in danger indirectly the nuclear security, when overloading to the operators, as it has signalled .
In the first place, because they still exist *atropellos to the human dignity and to the human rights of the *timorenses that find  refugees in other zones of *Timor, in particular in *Timor western and that wish to return to *Timor Oriental and is necessary that the authorities of Indonesian facilitate urgently the humanitarian action, in particular of the no governmental organisations.
Already there #be an approximate calculation of the costs of reconstruction -250 millions of euros, in three years- and the day 17 December will celebrate  a conference of donors.
It owes  simple and *llanamente to that *nos concentrate in the economic help and *nos forget of the fundamental things like the exercise of the tolerance, the exercise of the democracy and the support in the social field.
For *nosotros, the abolition of the pity of death is an intrinsic element of our politics in matter of human rights, whereas for #a lot of countries said question - #this is, at least, his thesis - *incumbe exclusively to the criminal subjects.
I believe that the Commission and, with *ella, #all the European Union has taken to know, clearly, from the principle, that *nosotros condemned #all type of violence ethnic, without mattering the one who went his author and his victim.
Now well, in this resolution *nos refer to an independent investigation, which *nos allows to express our wish that the parts involved and, therefore, the Government of *Burundi do not limit  to explain his version of it occurred but that, apart from *eso, go out to the surface the facts.
Gentleman President, Mr. Commissioner, colleagues, have worked in *Ruanda and know the country from 1984, have been born in *Tanzanía and have lived in the country #a lot of years, and talk the main #african language of the region of the Great Lakes of *África. I believe that I #can say, therefore, that talk of this question with experience and with knowledge of cause.
It is not possible any national reconciliation without a true judicial treatment of this question, and #this *atañe so much to the #rwandan national justice as to the International Penal Court for *Rwanda.
*Nosotros Consider that the complete resumption of the cooperation saves relation with the results of the process of peace, #as well as with the instauration of a political and constitutional frame that conduct, finally, to the democratisation.
The attempt to show that the current prime minister, *Sharif, takes part in a criminal conspiracy and has created a system of nepotism #can not convert in a simulation of process.
While *Pakistán do not gather #all the necessary conditions for the urgent and indispensable economic reforms, social and human will not be able to recover his quality of member of the *Commonwealth neither will be able to benefit of the agreement of cooperation with the European Union.
First: #all *nosotros, progressive or conservative of this Plenary, have to have clear, and believe that we have it, that the approach of the politics of drugs has to split always of a budget: the *drogodependientes do not need by principle of the pity and the persecution, but of the help and of the support.
The past week, the President of the Commission signalled that it has developed  in the breast of the Union a "inner market for the traffic of drugs".
The main problem of my report rooted in that to measure that passed the work went  taking more evident that the European Bank of Investments in it that concerns to the modern management of companies, to the transparency and to work publicly finds  certainly delayed.
In May of 1999, my predecessor, the Mr. *Blak, Vice-president of the Commission of Control Budgetary, formulated 26 concrete questions about presumptive frauds, bad management, corruption and cover-up -have said "cover-up" -in the activities of the Bank, operations of box included, along the period 1993-1998.
It #can not  follow reducing the "social costs" to fulfil with the criteria imposed to the national budgets by the Pact of Stability, while they repeat  beautiful words of social support that afterwards do not materialise  in the practice.
Precisely in this field the #european dockyards means have developed a very rich inventiveness, but the investigation and the development, and no only the production and the acquisition, require money, and here is #where take part the subventions.
From 1997, *Corean-*Gaz restricts the biddings for the construction of fuselages *metaneros to the #korean dockyards, it that constitutes equally, in my opinion, a rape of the international rules of liberalisation of the public agreements.
The European Union, gentleman Commissioner, with #all the political means, economic, financial and commercial to his scope, has to take cost the international norms and put brake, once and for all, to the *dumping #korean, because the #european sector #can be viable in some loyal competitive surroundings.
The States Joined, that present  with an image of propaganda like the champions of the *librecambismo, of the free market, only have this position for it that *les interests: for the audiovisual sector, for the sector *agroalimentario, for #everything it that *les interests.
It is a tragedy ascertain that still in the European Union there are defenceless citizens in front of the sectarian violence of #one #few, having to pay a very high price for keeping  in his convictions in front of the terrorist blackmail.
*Ojalá That enjoy during #a lot of years and decades of a democratic politics in *Irlanda of the North and *le pray, lady Speaker and also through our here present colleague #Jim *Nicholson, to the one who include in the leadership of *Irlanda of the North, that transmit the best wishes of this Parliament to #all *ellos.
Today I occupy knowingly the seat of #John *Hume, because like winner of the Prize *Nobel of this Parliament and because it has devoted #all his life to guarantee the process of peace, believe that it is important that *le honour since it finds  *convaleciente in his house of *Irlanda of the North.
I want to, in the first place, congratulate to the rulers, to the political parties, to the intermediaries and especially to the #british village and to the village of *Irlanda by this path of peace that have found, yielding #all in his postures *originarias.
It is not possible to allow to the representative of a big Group talk during three minutes and not conceding the use of the word to a representative of a small Group, although we do not agree with *él and although it hurt it that goes to say.
Lady Speaker, as *usted will comprise, in these two planes, the world-wide and the European, from the next year go to take of the anti-doping fight a tip of spear of our sportive politics.
Second, they exist the questions that of *ello derive  as, for example, the fact that the enlargement *repercutirá in the other Institutions and in #all the #european organs like the Court of Justice and, definitely, also in this Plenary that, to measure that go *ingresando new members, will have to prepare to receive until 700 and no more of 700 representatives.
The majority of the Group says: #if *Turquía happens to be member of the European Union, the Union -and is *algo that we have to have clear- will experience a qualitative change from the point of sight political, economic and cultural.
#One *CIG that do not amend the mood to review the Treaties in the future and allow that the political sectors the weaken #would loom with paralysing the Union *cuando #this try *modernizarse after the adhesion of the new States members.
And a Union that fears to reinforce his liberal character and member of parliament will be a little attractive Union for the States members that incorporate  and a little reliable speaker in the world-wide panorama.
To our trial, it #would be necessary to consider models of distinct grade of adhesion and it #would be necessary to aspire to a concentric Union, in the that there was a core of State Federal and an external circle less integrated.
It remains for taking note that in the summit of *Helsinki will define  with more precision the politics of the European Union in his #nordic dimension and, thanks to *ello, will be able to reinforce  the instruments for the stability and the security of *Europa of the North.
The defence of the democracy and the fight against the extremist movements split of the base of the social justice, it that means, among other things, that it is necessary to finish with the unemployment.
Today we are assisting to a historical minimum inside the brief history of the euro, and believe that the European Council of *Helsinki #would have to consecrate *algún space to the subject of the external representation of the zone euro.
I am not at all of agreement: it treats  of a Summit of extraordinary importance that have prepared -the Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency in exercise of the Council- with great care, with strength, and the challenge of the enlargement is a historical challenge, #whose importance is crucial.
We split *ciñéndonos to the document presenting previously, with strong proposals and also with the spirit that, after this enlargement, will pose  for real the problem to define with care, with attention and with a very wide debate the that they are the limits and the nature of *Europa.
They exist agreements that #can conduct to a strategy of closing of these head offices that offer security and that to #the same time leave to these countries the possibility to surpass his problems of way realistic and shared.
For example, we #can take in have more detail in the future the questions related with the political asylum and with the refugees, since *ello encloses a transcendental factor from the point of sight of the human rights.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam and the disposals on the human rights that finish to go in in vigour improve the possibilities of performance of the EU to promote the human rights.
But the publication of this document *me incites to put the watches in the next future, the editorial of a Letter of Rights Fundamental of the European Union.
It needs  more concretion and development and some deeper analyses. The Parliament will go back on this subject with a report that will vote  in March of the next year and that will have the honour to be his speaker.
The Council has to have the political value to loan more attention to the internal situation of the human rights in the EU in the next annual report.
Likewise, they are expression of the #christian values that during two one thousand years have constituted an indispensable part of the *acervo cultural and spiritual European and that, in front of the new #millenium, are a glorious base to continue the fight in favour of the human rights.
In relation with the important process of enlargement eastwards, the requirements on suspension and back abolition of the pity of death have influenced, so much in the ethical concepts as in the legislations, to improve the life, even in our own continent.
To #that *respecto, the forum #whose creation asked our Parliament #would have to exert an important paper; it will be able to support in the already existent structures, in particular in the Economic and Social Committee of the European Community.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, once again, #few weeks after the debate on the extension of the program #Socrates to the #turkish youth, this Parliament goes back to occupy  of the controversial question of the relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *yo want to manifest, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European (*Demócratacristianos)/European Democrats, that the present proposal of directive constitutes a new contribution to the construction of the #european politics in favour of the quality of the air.
The development of the managerial frame on the quality of the air acclimatise foresees the adoption of directives derivative for a series of substances harmful.
The requirements established by the European Commission and the amendments of the Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of the Consumer that the expand are very demanding from this point of sight.
A *tercer goal of the Directive Mark on the Quality of the Air, #as well as of the present proposal is to guarantee that the States members evaluate the quality of the air of way coherent and comparable.
Therefore we propose the following new editorial: "In the reports of the years in that they will have to fulfil the partial goals and finals will mention  #if the decreases obey to technological measures adopted by the manufacturers or #if they exist other factors, #such like changes in the behaviour of the consumers."

Wish simply manifest, in name of the Commission of Cooperation and Development, #all my worry about this budget of the 2000 that, in absence of a review of the financial perspectives, takes *recaer entirely the sacrifices on the poorest countries.

*Nos Interests to have a base of work serious that *nos allow to work jointly from a solid foundation, instead of *limitarnos to jump of a problem to #another, and that serve for varied years, as the problem of the *Balcanes is not a problem of a year.
The first observation that #can take  to the budgetary procedure of this year is that so much the Commission like the Council have procured that it take  public the quantity of money available for a determined purpose, but without that know  very very how has to carry out the finance.
The term of #time and the possibilities to adapt the current budgets are crucial for the Group of the Greens and of the European Free Alliance.

The position of the Popular Party European finished accepted by other political strengths, by it that consider essential that this debate celebrate  here and in this moment, in the day in that, by lucky coincidence, *nos visits a delegation of the #chinese parliament.

The defence of the consumer demands that there #be a very precise and complete information on the foods, included the relative to the new foods for animals and to the labeling of products *exentos of *OGM.

Because they have preached in *Kosovo with the example of the contempt to the international organisms and to the peaceful methods of resolution of the differences.

*Yo, of course, *me engage absolutely, by part of the Commission, no only to a permanent collaboration, to a permanent information, but to the infrastructure until the last day of the proposals and the works of the European Parliament.
Lady Speaker, wanted to so only say that this question of the labeling of the meat of bovine, from the point of sight political, is #one of the most delicate questions of the agricultural politics and *agroalimentaria.
#If it treats  of a problem of sense common, results that the #french consumers do not want this type of meat #british, and the discussion will not take that it change at all.
This White Book includes #many of the subjects on the that have treated here and in the Commission of Environment in reiterated occasions. But it includes besides a relative chapter to the agency of security alimentary.
Gentleman President, under the #finnish Presidency already has adopted  the decision that the agendas of the sessions of the *COREPER are accessible to the public, and #this is a step in the direction wished by the *formulador of the question.
How position and how political initiatives thinks to adopt the Council to contribute to the respect of the planned date by the UN for the celebration of the referendum, on 31 July of the year 2000?
The General Secretary of the UN added that it #would present in December to the Council of Security of the UN a realistic estimate of the future measures in his next report.
Lady representative of the Council, have listened the report of *Kofi *Annan on the last data regarding the referendum and have been in the 25ª Conference of #european support of the no governmental organisations to the village *saharaui takes #few weeks in Canarians.
Gentleman President, as I finish to say, the Council do not wants to involve directly in the operation of other international organisations, but, of course, the Council is slope to the evolution of this subject in the measure that progresses, and later will be considered the possible consequences.
In this context, the EU received of positive form the recent report of the General Secretary of the UN on the protection of the civil population in the conflicts armed.
In effect, the basic principles of the humanitarian international Right, that contain the Agreements of Gin, are values that it is necessary to keep like foundation of the #european construction and promote from the institutional action.
Gentleman President, in the first place, the problem mentioned in the last part of the question resides in that there are #a lot of ancient unemployed soldiers so much in the aspiring countries to the adhesion, as in third near countries to the EU.
The importance of said managerial roots in that *nos will help to tackle the situation of the companies, to cause, in reality, a change of habits so that we happen of the delays to the *prontitud in the payments like norm inside the Only Market European and no, as it occurs at present, it contrary.
We have to have present that 450.000 workers have lost his work in a social climate in the that the most important problem to the that the European Union has to confront is precisely the fight against the unemployment.
According to the Commission, the delay is due to the fact that the reports of works in course of the States members, that seat the bases for the general rule of a compulsory system, have presented  too much late.
We #can not approve without reservations a new postponement of a year, since nobody *nos guarantees that the next year by these same dates no  *nos go back to force to concede another postponement because determined States members have not taken his duties.
Maybe we do not have of sufficient journalists with scientific training and that they #can express in figures question like the of the risk or maybe a headline *sensacional in cover that increase the sale of a newspaper was -as I suspect *yo- more important that give information to the consumers so that they #can adopt his decisions to the hour to buy.
We see that the Regulation *nº 820/97  *nos escapes of the hands to drop in a swamp of practices voluntary observed half and without immediate perspectives for the compulsory plan, that, as they know #all the deputies to this Assembly, is necessary.
It has agreed  accept the recommendation of the Scientific Committee like base for #all the decisions on the look of the production of foods relative to the public health.
By misfortune, the atmospheric conditions in *Bruselas has forced to the cancellation of the flight of this morning and, by this reason, have not been able to be present in person to inform to the Parliament on the relative controversy to the *EEB.
Finally, it #would wish to repeat it that had said after the first reading, is to say, our deep consideration by the services loaned by the Commission of Budgets, #whose members have  *desvivido -#that is the word- during this double procedure, in first and *segunda reading, and to those who believe that our Assembly *les owes a deep gratitude.
From 1998 the budgets collect #one *minipartida of 15 millions of euros, a 50% of the quantity of the national program for the improvement of the production and the commercialisation of the honey. And #this is like this in virtue of a regulation that have criticised by insufficient.
Thanks to the label, will reign the alimentary security, the consumers will be protected and our Green colleagues will be satisfied to have ensured the survival of the alimentary humanity...
The original goal of the Commission, reestablish the confidence in the protection to the consumer to #european level, #would convert  in his contrary by means of the adoption of a measure of this type.
I expect that it find continuation the approach that has produced  up to now among the Commission and the European Parliament, the *cual already has tackled varied times this problematic in the previous terms of office, so much in the Commission of Culture as in Plenary.
Nevertheless, #some months later, after the creation of the new Commission, the general Direction of competition pushes another time to the Commission to act against the agreements *transfronterizos and the only price of the book.
It is a truth of *Perogrullo say that the books are not commodities like the butter, praise eggs, the cheese, but a very cultural, and therefore, from the point of sight of the Right of the competition, #can not be treated like butter, eggs, cheese.
As already it has said , it #would be absolutely unacceptable that raised  the embargo of arms, especially to the light of the fact that the #indonesian soldiers have not disarmed to the militia.
Of the arrival of the strengths of the *UNAMSL, the mission of the Nations Joined in #Sierra Lion, will depend in the first months #if it produces  a new impulse of the process of disarmament and with *ello an improvement of the security.
#This has not been consequence of the politics of the #taliban diet, to the style of the apartheid, regarding the women, but of the protection offered by the Talibans to the Mr. *Bin *Laden.
Among these ailing prisoners finds  #Mohamed *Kadamiousouf, representative in *Europa of the Front for the Restoration of the Unit and the Democracy, illegally extradited of *Etiopía in 1997, and that, by fault of medical assistance runs the danger to lose the sight.
Like this as, throw the fault only to the Government of *Djibouti means, in the best of the cases, dissemble the responsibilities of the #french Government, but, in reality, is to endorse a politics of support to an authoritarian diet and *represivo.
The Commission entrusts in that the #nicaraguan authorities will take into account these arguments contributed by the European Union, #as well as by other members of the international community, and in that they will rectify  the measures adopted against the office of the *Contralor General and against *él same.
It #would be irresponsible today not recognising publicly the disappointment that *nos produces the fact that to the cape of year and half so only 91 States have signed it and hardly 5 or 6 have ratified it *cuando -as it has said the Mrs. *Schörling- are precise 60 ratifications so that the Court go in in exercise.
Thus *reviste a capital importance the that it exist an only penal court for #everyone to judge the genocide and the crimes against the humanity, #as well as that exist only penal measures for #everyone, so that like this #all know that it do not matters with how pretext, ideology or nationality act: it illicit is always illicit and has to be pursued.
Gentleman President, estimated ladies and gentlemen deputies, the Commission shares fully the goal of the appeal on the that is debating  here, and considers that the initiative of the European Parliament is useful and profitable, as *nosotros also sustain that it is necessary to give more significant steps #if the International Penal Court converts  finally in reality.
Already I have taken quotation of the problems of order constitutional, and are had to share our experiences in processes of ratification and our skilled knowledges in this matter with the States interested.
Gentleman President, lady speaker, *señorías, #everyone puts  of agreement here to signal the need to have in the community plane, of agricultural statistics so precise, reliable and coherent as it was possible, so that they #can measure  of effective way the consequences of the decisions adopted in the frame of the *PAC, mainly in the half rural.
Gentleman President, simply want to appreciate and congratulate to the Mr. *Mayer by the report that has taken, that *atañe to #all those producing countries of *lúpulo in this Community and, in the case of *España, to my region, *Castilla-Lion, in the zone of Lion.
The year 1997 is marked also, *señorías, and go in in the central question of the subject, by a civil war in *Tayikistán, a horrible civil war among the power installed and the #islamic opposition.
Yes I agree with this relative concrete help to the part of the loan, by humanitarian reasons. Without embargo, the part of the donation has to delete by the already mentioned reasons.
*Armenia And #Georgia go to have difficulties to understand that the community diminishes his help in spite of the great efforts made by both countries, with backrest of the #FMI and of other organisms of help, to diminish his debt with *ella.
*Le Pray ask to his services that examine again the amendment 20. I am safe in a 99,9% that it is not the text that vote or, in any case, no the text that had to have  presented, since it is not the result to the that got the Commission of Industry.
How measured has intention to adopt the Council, also in the frame of the reform of the structural Bottoms and of the community initiative *Interreg, to materialise all it foreseen to this *respecto in the Treaty of *Amsterdam?
There was a text of the Commission of the European Communities in the document Diary 2000 in virtue of the *cual these regions *ultraperiféricas #would remain *exentas of the requirement of the 75 % of the community #GDP *per *cápita to remain like regions of Goal 1.
The Council will be to the common that the Indian made a proof on 11 April with a ballistic missile of half scope, the *Agni *II, able to take target to 2 000 kilometres of distance and that it #can go endowed with a nuclear head.
In consequence, the Council will study the query that *le presented the President of the European Parliament on 11 March 1999, is to say, will examine #if it is possible an individual participation of deputies of the European Parliament.
As I already have said, the question of the participation of the European Parliament in the Conference of River goes  to treat in base to the principles agreed by the Council.
Like this, as, there was true *inadecuación among the methodology of the Commission, his structure, his tradition, and the tasks that  *le entrusted afterwards and for the *cuales neither the Council and -*me *atrevo to say it-neither the Parliament *le conceded the convenient means.
They are delivered very correctly among the distinct States and, as it also says with reason the speaker, do not exist States ancient Members that still do not have any agency and are convinced that for the States new Members already will find  other new agencies.
The most important points are: first, in the Commission have to delimit clearly the fields of work of the Commissioners and acting, of analogous mood to the Ministers and secretaries of State in the national Governments.
I believe that it is well remember this saying to #all #that that think that the democratic deficit, the fault of control, the negligence in the management and, in last place, but no therefore less important, the already notorious «*profitariado» to #european level #can reduce *traspasando even more competitions and more instruments and possibilities to this level.
Like this, it has some weeks, the Government presented a national program for the adoption of the *acervo community and a series of laws very important in matter of VAT and of special taxes, #as well as on the right to purchase sakes real estates.
It That do not helps to solve at all are the demonstrations of #some States Members, included my own country, *Holanda, in the that pretty much follows  refusing the adhesion of *Chipre while it have not put  end to the partition of the island.
It is obvious that all #this do not depends only of the legislation that adopt , but that it is important likewise make efforts in favour of the local organisations, so much #that of voluntary character as, for example, *Urban Forum, that already exerts his activities in the Union, to end to allow his expansion and his operation in the *Europa Central and Oriental.
*Confrontados With the need to determine his positions in the negotiations, the countries candidates have introduced in a relatively short term considerable improvements in his organisation and internal coordination.
In #a lot of countries, and said was of step that no only occurs in the countries candidates, but also in the States Members, produce  long delays in the judicial procedures, frequently caused by the fault of staff of the judicial power.
Therefore, my first question to the Commission is the following: How reasons *convincentes have motivated to the Commission to substitute a system that works well, that do not prejudices to the competition in the market and that results satisfactory for #everyone of the sector?
An acceptance of the amendments #would comport a modification of the object of the current legislative procedure and #would involve the taking of a decision without previous query of #all the parts involved.
Regarding the question formulated also by the Mrs. *Lulling, of #which are the reasons *convincentes to modify the norms for the sector *cervecero, the answer is that the current exemption by category exempts the closing of the market.
*Cuando The corresponding annual report to 1997 examined  in the Parliament, #some critical voices suggested that the Defender of the European Village only had succeeded in a small number of cases.
#All the members of our commission underline unanimously the need that it follow existing a Commission of Requests independent so that the direct contact with the citizens keep  in the future.
And the fact that #one of these fields in that they receive  requests was environment shows *ejemplarmente how the citizens and the no governmental organisations, of the one who split the complaints, have an extraordinary worry by the preservation of the half natural.
In front of this situation, invite to each #one of the members of this House to that they read with *detenimiento the annexes of the report of the Mr. *Newman. Like this  *percatarán that really it is absurd deliver the competitions of this commission among the other commissions.
Also it has given off today #this of the report that has presented the Defender of the Village to the Parliament. *Le Appreciate that it have defended so firmly the need of a transparent administration.
The Commission of Requests and the Defender of the Village will not suffice, in the future -further of his merits-, for *paliar the incoherences and the excesses of a machinery *tecnocrática.
The decision adopted by the #german court *nos has cheered *muchísimo, but too much often this type of causes judge  in front of judges that, or ignore the relative legislation to the kidnapping of boys, or are badly informed about *ella.
Besides, it has presented  an amendment in the that urges  to the Commission to that it elaborate criteria allocated to control the efficiency of the States members in the administration of the collection of the rights of customs.
This amendment also has to be contemplated in relation with the amendment 18, of the that the Commission estimates that it #can accept the *primer separated inserting it, without embargo, in the text of the article 3 of the initial proposal of «Customs 2000», #where finds his reason to be.
Until the moment there #be had #one very fine communication and, therefore, think that the program will go out forward without a procedure of conciliation, since I think that #some of these objections are so secondary that believe that my colleagues of the Parliament will not put objections.
Lady Speaker, estimated colleagues, in September of the year happened the Commission *nos presented the White Book titled «just Rates by the use of infrastructures: gradual Strategy for a common frame of *tarificación of infrastructures of transport in the EU».
*Yo Think, nevertheless, that the only effective form to carry to the practice the principle that the user pays consists in involving to #all the users of the infrastructure of transport, without exception.
The Parliament has right to manifest his dissatisfaction by #some of the actions of the NATO, in particular the bombardment of goals civil and the utilisation of arms that #many consider like arms of destruction in mass.
The deputies to the European Parliament of the *PASOK, vote against of the resolution of the European Parliament on *Kosovo because we consider that it do not offers positive services directed to find a solution of the problem.
In effect, do not forget never that the diplomacy consists in taking accept, to *través of the dialogue, to #one or another part in conflict, a partial cession of his initial claims, of his requirements or even of his rights.
Wish, of course, a diplomatic exit European with the support of the States Joined and of *Rusia, but an exit that do not suppose any renunciation of the democratic principles and of the human rights.
But limit only to this analysis, means to forget that the military commitment of the NATO against *Yugoslavia is the result of an unanimous #european will, that manifested  in the Summit of *Berlín and of the that the federalistic congratulated  and  *congratularon, *considerándola like the true game of birth of the *PESC.
Also it is necessary to imagine a new conception of *Europa, valid for #all our continent: the of a family of nations allocated to coexist in the confidence, the identity *recobrada and recognised and the reciprocal respect.
With the proposal that supports a majority of the Commission of Transport and Tourism runs  the risk to increase even more the derivative costs of the sector of the transports.
In the Group of the *PPE have elaborated a series of amendments to counter these effects. Until the moment have not reached any support for these amendments.
It wanted to contribute firmly to improve the requirements according to the *cuales makes  the route that corresponds to the road of the distance of a transport combined. And no, in last term, by means of the decrease of the costs many times *desproporcionalmente elevated of parts limited of the distance by road of the transport combined.
The present communication of the Commission titles : «Establishment of a frame of performance». It treats  of a very useful document to examine #all the questions that pose  regarding the financial services.
Gentleman President, #one of the very sensitive questions of the sector saves relation with the supervision and the prudential control. This activity bases  at present in the borders and the national market.
With *respecto, in *primer term, to the need for a Commission, even *dimisionaria, of not interrupting the task undertaken, believe that the fact to continue it that already has begun  form splits of the management of the common subjects.
It wanted to highlight that, regarding the possibility of a better supervision of the financial services in the field of the European Union, our attention #would have to centre  in the financial groups complexes.
The report that have elaborated and the amendments that present are the reflection of the debate in #whose virtue this Plenary approved, the past month of March, a resolution on the violence against the women.
It treats  of a zone *fulcral for the stability in the world and create, therefore, that have to vote in favour of a resolution that once again transmit the word of the European Parliament of support to this village of *Timor Oriental, that so much has suffered of genocide.
Gentleman President, 48 political parties prepare  for the elections. They manifest  political currents among the parties characterised by the *islamismo, the nationalism, the liberalism, the support to the central planning and the maintenance of the *statu *quo .
It has to insist to the #indonesian Government so that it leave to support to the organisations *paramilitares, limit the military presence, reestablish the state of right and truly arrest to the guilty and the carry in front of the courts.
Alas, we have to take again a call to the #burmese Government so that the fundamental rights of his village respect  with general character. Again, we have to condemn firmly the trip *forzoso of villages and the utilisation of persons like compulsory workers.
To #the same time, believe that, with regard to *Birmania, in addition to the necessary initiatives of isolation, is precise to fix a political strategy to favour a change in this country, a change that, as we have seen, also the #burmese village wishes firmly.
It is #ours to have to urge to the Commission to that it exert pressure on the neighbouring countries so that *Birmania finish isolating, the Government find  in the obligation to resign and leave to abuse to the inhabitants of the villages that are forced to make works forced or that they are deported in block.
To #the same time have to encourage and *emplazar to the Council to that it interrupt #all the activities in the that was collaborating jointly with the countries of the *ASEAN and *Birmania, aside to *Birmania of said actions and procure that the #german Presidency leave to award visas of entrance, to the equal that the other community countries.
Still it remains *algo of hope put that the opposition has manifested his wish of *darle an opportunity to the Army so that *restituya the power to a civil Government in the term of nine months.
The Commission examines by the moment, #such as it has suggested  from this House, how disposals #can adopt in view of the recent events and #one of the possibilities is that it propose to the Council paralyse partially the cooperation to the development according to the known by #all *ustedes article 366 *bis of the Agreement of *Lomé.
It is precise to ascertain, once again, that the ambitious goal of the Parliament has seen  hindered by the opposition of those States members that  *obstinan in refusing the logical consequences of the application of the only market.
Our agriculturalists do not understand the import, pertinent of third countries, of agricultural products modified genetically allocated to the animal feeding, since they exist suspicions regarding the effects on a long-term basis, with regard to the quality of the meat, of the utilisation of *OMG.
His institutions are *sólidamente established and guarantee the existence of a State of right, the respect of the human rights, #as well as the respect and the protection of the minorities.
Taking into account the principle of subsidiariness, consider clear and *decididamente that the EU has to establish only some minimum rates and that corresponds to the respective States members manage said rates, #among others reasons because the European Union do not has to have on no account of rights in the fiscal field.
It pleads  aptly in this report by that also they support  the projects directed to find to the victims, eventual victims of kidnappings that, for example, disappear in the prostitution and that maybe go back to appear in these photos, that with commercial ends are offered in the network by determined criminal.
In consequence, has included in the title «public Health» a field to the that, to our understand, #would have to apply by greater coherence the article 308 of said Treaty. It is to say, the that, in definite, attributes powers of action no on purpose planned, *cuando an action of the Community result necessary to reach #one of the goals of the Community.
Without embargo, the probability that his authors are carried in front of the courts is considerably lower that in the case of the traffic of drugs or of arms. *Ello Has to  mainly to the fault of proofs valid.
His gradual enlargement to the countries that *ingresen in the EU, as they have mentioned varied deputies, and to the countries of the *AELC, *reviste vital importance, in view of the transnational dimension of #many of the forms of violence.
We have of a report of the juridical adviser of the Parliament that *nos orients among other things about the subject of the common subjects. Said *dictamen collects fundamental disposals with regard to the question that are debating now.
In this sense, although the simple assimilation to the motion of censorship do not seems indicated, seems according to the spirit of the Treaty look for solutions that are compatible with the principle of confidence parliamentary.
So that, #if have 75 millions of persons that surpass the 60 years and a 42 % of the voters have more of 50 years age, is evident that the questions of the citizens of the third age and of the persons of age advanced go to be important in the campaign.
I expect that the present Commission a program of action on the health of the persons of age advanced and for #all the Community of compliance with the article 137.
(OF ) Gentleman President, the history of this conference, «The persons of age in the century *XXI: new perspectives of life», puts of self-evident the difference that there #be among the said and the fact *cuando treats  of the persons of age advanced.
Has to adapt  the work to the capacities and the needs of the persons, in place to demand to the workers an adaptation to the requirements of the labour activity.
#If it do not reaches  form to the most greater workers to exert new tasks, these persons will find  exposed to a situation of discrimination in the places of work, to #the same time that numerous sectors suffer shortage of hand of drama.
Besides, the report do not detains  in the enormous potential of knowledges that possesses a person of 65 years and the current tendency of the labour market to follow having the citizens of the third age.
It is a reason of satisfaction that in the report take  upsetting in the enormous potential that offer the greater persons and in the need to act to end to explode this potential.
In #one of the examples takes  reference to the need to guarantee to the elderly a sufficient level of income. Often, the situation of the most greater women is considerably more *desfavorable that the of the men.
It #would not be a fine idea that in zones ecologically sensitive, like the lakes *fineses, imposed  in the measure of it possible the use of products elaborated from agricultural products, for example plastic matters to base of starch, *biolubricante in #all these lakes *fineses, elaborated from products with #alto contained in proteins in the south of *Europa.
#If, #such as, as it seems, is forced to observe nowadays, take  #some #granting to the Americans, especially in the subject of the #gluten of wheat, in the that they are these last the that *nos assault without that we have presented still any complaint in front of the World-wide Organisation of the Trade, certainly #can house legitimate worries.
We have developed the biological oils, that #can be introduced in aqueous zones protected, in the Lake #Constanza or #where was, #as well as also in the field of the leisure #where the damage is each more greater #if they do not use  these oils.
The of technological type, #this is, the measures for the that there #be available technology, are the that fundamentally have attracted the attention of the Commission of Investigation, Technological Development and Energy of the European Parliament.
The phenomenon of the *acqua high that, *cuando  self-evident, covers around half metre the historical centre, produces  some ten times to the year and creates increasing annoyances to the citizens and, even more, to the economic activities of #Venecia Lagoon, the insular part of the city.
The Group of Independent by the *Europa of the Nations requests that it withdraw  of the agenda the report of the Mrs. #Miranda of *Lage on the agreement of collaboration among the European Community and the States Joined Mexicans.
They fulfilled  the requirements that, in this case, *nos take *remitirnos of the Record of 1976, to the regulation on privileges and immunities in the primary Right, and of here to the #portuguese Constitution and even to the #portuguese procedural Right.
It #can not be that in the past -and expect that only in the happened- the great Groups of this Assembly had a greater interest in protecting to the Commission that in *llamarla to the responsibility and in strengthening to the own Parliament?
Of this luck, the procedure of approval of the management has voted  by simple majority, but the denial of the approval of the management has voted  by absolute majority.
Lady Speaker, as it finishes to say the president *Fayot, in this report there #be had an excellent collaboration among the Commission of Regulation and the Commission of Control Budgetary.
Lady Speaker, *originariamente the present report of the Commission of Employment owed *versar, especially, about a communication of the Commission on the article 127 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and, in concrete, in relation with the *mainstreaming of the politics of employment to community level.
It has to contain concrete measures and engage to #all the involved to fulfil clear agreements, so much to the Central Bank European, to the social speakers, as to the Council of the *ECOFIN and to the Council of Subjects Social.
It has been the Council in particular, that in #some questions very important, for example the trip of the taxes on the employment to environmental and energetic taxes, do not wants to advance and probably now have remained  again blocked.
Lady Speaker, the report of the Commission on the great orientations, that this year characterises  by a qualitative improvement, loans to the employment a special attention, and stresses the need of authentic structural changes.
It is as #if the governments and the social speakers by himself/hisself alone #can influence the economic politics and as #if the #ECB did not have also a paper in relation with the support of the economic politics.
Gentleman President, in name of my colleague the Mr. *Flynn, wanted to begin congratulating to the Mr. *Menrad by his report and appreciating to the Commission of Employment and Social Subjects his fast work on the project of resolution.
In *Viena the European Council asked a greater synergy among the two processes and the Commission answered to this request with his great guidelines of economic politics more recent and his communication on the article 127.
But *yo create to be able of *tranquilizarle. The strategy of coordination fiscal proposal by the Commission and adopted by unanimity by the Council «*Ecofin», defended #among others by the speaker, Mr. *Fourçans, is not obviously a strategy of harmonisation attractive.
Second, the director is forced on purpose to contact and inform to the national judicial authorities competent, #if in the internal investigations his collaborators find states of things that #can be notable from the point of sight penal.
Of this luck the Commission renounced, fortunately, to the *estrafalaria contrives to entrust the competition in matter of irregularities and of frauds to an external agency with, *pásmense, 48 employees, is to say, with a civil servant to protect an average of 2.000 millions of euros.
By this reason the creation of this new organ of fight against the fraud means a big opportunity for the Community and an important goal of our Presidency of the Council.
Gentleman President, the report of the Mr. *Bösch and the decision of the Commission to create a #european office of prevention of the fraud indicates the end of a long process that initiated  in 1995.
The paramount goals were the to underline the obligations of the personnel to cooperate in the investigations and to #the same time protect the rights of the individual.
The amendments of November of 1998 to the budgetary regulation made possible a modernisation of the financial control, especially regarding the assignment of the no used resources.
On the procedure, wanted to express my gratitude to the colleagues of the Commission of Control Budgetary that have taken contributions to this process of approval of the management.
Also it corresponds to the political character of this report the coalition of the procedure of approval of the management in a wider perspective.
They do not have to  consider some requests to the Court of Accounts so that it take part in some studies like a cancellation of the responsibility of the Commission and of the Parliament concerning the measures that adopt.
But the Court of Accounts has exerted a very important paper and very useful in this process among the Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
In my condition of speaker, have received a paper in the that in fact it reflects  the loss of thousands of millions in erroneous investments and that this money finds  unseen in the accounts or has been concealed.
It results quite funny, because, #if His *Señorías retreat a year or two, will see that the Court of Accounts criticised to the civil servants of *Dublín that used the weekends like part of his mission: obviously, *les enjoys to take a trip to his country to #the same time.
Gentleman President, expect with interest the day -and do not believe that it was too much far- in that the Court of Accounts #can give to these two agencies a certificate of guarantee by «not to dip in *líos», for saying it like this, and for obtaining fine reports of the Court.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, the Commission of Development and Cooperation has to approve year to year the management of the European Bottom of Development but do not has *influjo #any on the way in that it uses  this Bottom, because up to now it has not been *presupuestado.
#If *algo positive has resulted of the corresponding report to 1996, has been the access that the Commission of Control Budgetary has had to the persons and the documents.
The postponement constitutes as, the justest solution technically, solution that has a political value of gesture of *apaciguamiento to the new Commission without excluding in any case the most strict surveillance and #one some firmness.
As I consider natural that transfer  to the next term of office, *permítaseme, meanwhile, that take part, like speaker for the granting of the approval of the management to the Economic and Social Committee relative to the exercise of 1996, to affirm that no  *le will be able to concede without that before it pronounce  the *UCLAF on the irregularities in *ella detected.
The defence of the liberal, of #that that always have recognised in the *rule *of *law the axis of his political action, always has based  in the principle that they #can not  put objections to the texts.
Gentleman President, wanted to answer to the questions formulated by the Mr. *Elles on the preparation of the different documents based in the program that the Mr. *Santer presented in January and to the that it has taken  reference in #many of the reports on the approval of the management.
They have initiated  the technical negotiations in search of the consensus with the organisations of the personnel and also have celebrated  the first political sessions in search of the consensus.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds  to the debate of the Statement of the Commission on the procedure *OMC for the arrangement of the conflict among the European Union and the States Joined of *América.
Gentleman President, gentleman Vice-president of the Commission, in this commercial war -the bananas, the hormones- there #be an appendix that, as #all know, affects to companies and economic sectors Europeans that do not have at all that see with the sectors object of the conflict.
This morning in *Bruselas, before coming here, have celebrated a meeting with representatives of the #european textile industry and understand perfectly the gravity of the situation for *ella and for other persons that find  in the situation of victims.
Precisely because it treats  of an experiment, the majority of the Commission of Subjects Economic agreed with the general criteria and no with the delimitation of the field of application to determined sectors.
This Parliament has proposed that the Commission, in *concertación with the European Parliament and, for example, on the base of the *dictámenes of high personalities and in *concertación with the national parliaments, give a new opportunity to this institutional dynamics.
Equality of opportunities for men and women, for whites and blacks, for #all the colours, on the base of the human dignity of each individual. #This is the characteristic more remarkable of the European Union, his immense human face.
Without embargo, will not be necessary to tackle only the big structural reform of the Commission, for the *cual also the Parliament has presented already concrete proposals. It is precise to recognise that the European Parliament will have to reorganise  in like manner to be able to fulfil properly his tasks.
It suffice to think in the dispute among the States Joined and *Europa by the trade of skins of animals captured of cruel form, the trade of bananas and of meat with hormones and in concrete by the organisms manipulated genetically, especially after the failure, because of the *intransigencia American, of the Summit on *Bioseguridad of *Cartagena of Indians.
It is true that in the last years, like consequence of the fall of the wall of *Berlín, of the enlargement to new countries of the *Europa Central and of the North, in the perspective of an enlargement to the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental, *Europa has displaced  to the north and eastwards.
The vote in favour of the Mr. *Prodi and the vote in favour of the new School, in my opinion, will consecrate a pact of confidence among the Parliament and the Commission that has to last five years.
The *segunda thing that *me #would enjoy to mention today is his work to the hour to reform the work and the methods of work of the Commission -the new business culture.
It True is that *Europa has not been able to advance with the speed owed by these great paths of the new growth that include especially the new sectors: #software , telecommunications and also, as it has remembered  in regard to my previous speech, the that have called «the sciences of the life».
I do not lose the hope that in the course of the next term of office *nos loan more attention, because my fight in defence of the producers of honey and in defence of his products of high quality, in *Europa and in the Community, will continue here or out of this Parliament.
The fundamental lines of the economic politics are extraordinarily wander and imprecise in this occasion and, therefore, come to say that for the moment it will follow  acting simply as it has taken  up to now, which results extremely problematic to the sight of the problems accumulated.
We think, therefore, that it is necessary to put end what before to the military climbing, to the simplifications of the propaganda, and consecrate #all our energy to go back on the terrain of the research of a political solution.
To reach said pact of stability in the *Balcanes, #whose positive perspectives *nos has exposed, gentleman President of the Council, the Europeans have to have the value, #if really *les concerns and have felt of the independence, to interrupt the logic of the bellicose climbing.
The human drama has transformed  in disaster, the victims of the *hipócritas collateral accidents multiply , the pretext of *Rambouillet has disappeared, the autonomy of *Kosovo and the ethnic rights have not reestablished .
It is *algo that #one no *le wishes to nobody, and much less to a #serbian village and to some #serbian boys that have been conducted to the disaster by the madness of his leader, of #the same mood that has deported of hundreds of thousands of other persons.
Temporary protection of a substantial number of refugees in our States members and #all the possible support in material sense to the countries of the region, also *cuando have happened the crisis: *eso is it that *nosotros advocate.
Of compliance with our Regulation, will invite to the candidate selected to that it take part in front of the Commission of Subjects External, Security and Political of Defence on 21 June so that we #can formulate a positive recommendation to the Plenary of July.
*Yo Declare also that while there are not changes *interinstitucionales regarding the intervention of the right of control democratic of the European Parliament, the possibilities of influence in matter of external politics will be inferior to the that had up to now.
The Parliament takes a proposal that needs the permission of the Council, the fixed Council the conditions for the permission, and the Parliament has the possibility of *considerarlas and *discutirlas again.
We wanted to that it heard  our voice and, instead, *nos find confronted to a Council that of course, in forty-eight hours, *nos presents his version, the form in that *él, the Council, wants to treat to the deputies and, therefore, also the diets, the costs of missions, #etcetera.
#If the intention had been that applied  the procedure of *codecisión, #such as it establishes  in the article 189 *b, the editors of the Treaty of *Amsterdam #would have inscribed in the text: it will apply  the procedure of the article 189 *b.
Finally, I want *agradecerle in spite of #all to the Mr. *Rothley that referred  to my proposal to allow to the countries with a tax on the high income add an additional tax to the community tax.
As it collects  in the proposal of the Council, the deputies to the European Parliament have to be had also to subject  to a control on the appropriate utilisation of the bottoms in matter of administrative costs.
We expect that it get  *próximamente to an acceptable solution for the Parliament and the Council, #if well we comprise that the Parliament has to decide #if the current position of the Council is acceptable total or partially, and entrust in that early it #can  get to an agreement.
In relation with the total figure of subjects that has to tackle this community institution, the number of personnel of the Defender of the Village is considerably inferior to the of the #others equivalent institutions in the States members.
It is necessary to recognise that, until the moment, the Parliament has shown a relatively favourable attitude to the proposals of the Mr. *Söderman to resolve the problems more *acuciantes of the Union in matter of personnel.
I want to base it of the following way: in the last week, in the Commission of Transports have debated on these questions, but the situation has changed with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Also it #would be urgently necessary an agreement among the two relative directives to the commercialisation to distance with the directive on the electronic commercial transactions, *cuando know his definite form.
#If we want a real inner market in the field of the financial services, it is necessary to guarantee to the consumer and to the provider that will enjoy of #the same rights inside #all the Union.
Therefore, lean service *le go to take to the consumer #if, through a sectorial directive, begin to *desequilibrar the very complex building of the relations -has mentioned  the principle of subsidiariness- among community Right and Right of the States members.
Without embargo, our proposal *nos seems charitable so much for the companies as for the consumers because both parts will know #which are regulations that have to apply and both parts #can entrust in that they apply  #the same regulations of commercialisation, without mattering the origin of the services.
A defective product is defined like product that do not corresponds  with it established *contractualmente and also include  in this concept the public statements that the manufacturer or the dealer make in the advertising or that find  in the label.
To guarantee that it do not deceive  to the consumer, the guarantees have to contain clear and transparent informations, among #others the statement that the guarantee do not affects to the legal rights of the consumer.
The directive ensures that the States members take the transposition of the international right for January of 2002, creating with *ello a minimum group of regulations that concede to the right consumer to appeal a resource.
#If we see the calendar, *me cheers especially that am talking of the last looks of this directive in the last partial period of sessions of our Parliament -that also for me is the last session, at least in it that *atañe to the subjects of the consumers.
Therefore, it is indispensable to have a greater sensitivity in front of the problems that these regions have.*d)Highlights  the importance of the training of the population so that it contribute to his own *autoprotección. They include  also the situations of emergency environmental.
The goal of this proposal, as it is very known and has mentioned  also, is to guarantee the continuation of the current program of action in matter of civil protection, founded in the resolution of the Council of 1998 that expires on 31 December 1999.
It results that the amendment 19 and varied parts of the amendment 23 go directed to increase the participation of the *ONG in the civil protection, *algo in it that agree of course and that, therefore, accept also in principle because it awards to the *ONG the possibility to take part in the exchange of experts.
The Commission of Environment, Public Health and Protection of the Consumer has taken to feel his presence in the increasingly important field of the environmental legislation and know that we will follow taking it.
My mates in the Parliament wanted this directive, without embargo, believe that in this case have to listen to the organisations of *diabéticos, the *cuales have manifested unanimously that the commercialisation and the easy access to the products for *diabéticos create a false need among the *diabéticos.
It is to expect that the commitment of the Council to collect now a *dictamen to the Scientific Committee of Foods have by result the abandonment of the idea to elaborate a directive to the *respecto.
We expect that the following step was that the EU improve also the possibilities of the ecological agriculturalists to produce the necessary products of competitive form, *algo that do not takes lamentably the Diary 2000.
Thus it has to serve so that the European Parliament see how in the directives of character technical there #be a political content that #can not leave in hands of a committee of experts.
I expect that the Parliament approve the Thursday the Report *Aglietta relative to the conditions for the exert of the executive competitions attributed to the Commission so that this history of hits in the case of the *potitos see  confirmed by #a lot of #others more.
So in this point have abandoned our position that keep always and that will follow keeping to base our legislative measures in scientific knowledges, with the exception that they exist really causes of weight that *nos say that we have to follow only to the principle of prevention without scientific knowledges.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam also modifies the properly said procedure, and *eso knows  less, providing an absolute equality among the Parliament and the Council in the course of the procedure.
In fact it was not a committed simple by #a lot of reasons, but, especially, also because the Council no always comprised in sufficient grade the transcendence and complexity of this reform and -create- neither had sufficient consciousness, and more specifically in recent period, that we #can not allow that  *infringieran determined principles of a free Parliament.
From my Group ask the evaluation of the politics and, with #all the criticisms that have been able to take from the Group, the work that *ustedes have taken in this term of office, going out of distinct political Groups, has been very *estimable.
The period of his activity has had a big hit and #this is not the opinion only of my political group. It has made some great services to this Parliament.
I believe that, of compliance with the Regulation that *usted always has kept and respected *escrupulosamente, *permitiéndonos like this work *respetandolo, in the collective balance had to *usted have included that this Parliament finalises his term of office and has not been able to avert a war in #european territory.
A big support has obtained here the idea to include in the future dialogue on the fiscal politics, *salarial and monetary also to the social speakers and to the Central Bank European.
Already it was the employment, *Kosovo, the enlargement or the operation of the institutions, the European Union has to learn to talk with an alone voice for the 15 States members but also for the institutions.
In brief, we need that on the table of the Conference *Intergubernamental there #be a document it more authorised possible and #this because another type of preparation of the Conference *Intergubernamental #can guarantee a safer result in matter of reforms.
Lady Speaker, the Treaty of *Amsterdam that it #can define like the Treaty of the #stray occasions, has gone in in vigour only from takes #some days and already takes lacking to integrate it and complete it with these relative chapters to the institutional questions no resolved in *Amsterdam.
An important element of this task constitute it the approval and the practical application of the performances recommended in the northern dimension, that already has accepted .
The Council has declared  besides had to negotiate in his moment on the put to disposal of until 200 millions of euros of the reservation of flexibility of the budget like compensation for the innovative measures.
The Parliament also has reached to impose his criterion in the unification of #all the structural measures for the fishing in the Category 2 and in the horizontal programming unified.
Now well, accept a Statute of the #european deputies #would be like happening of a juridical nature of international right to a nature of right constitutional internal.
The reduction of the paper of the State, the blind belief in the rules of the competition or of the liberalisation to create employment are recipes that already have known.
In this *coyuntura critical that are crossing *Europa and the whole world, the election of the Mr. *Prodi (to the one who vote *gustoso) like President of the European Commission, by part of this Parliament, gives beginning to a new period in the European Union.
We have *presionado in favour of a transparent system of payments of diets, of a same wage for the deputies to the European Parliament of #all the countries and in favour of a suitable method of direct payments for the personnel.
The new statute characterised  by the rigour and the transparency regarding the rights and duties among #all the representatives chosen and allowed that it finished , once and for all, with the *indefiniciones and the *elucubraciones, that are the resource preferred of #all those that, by this road, procure to weaken the value of the political action.
But each #one of our colleagues that has pronounced  in favour of the Report *Rothley will have to assume his responsibilities in front of the public opinion and to the shrinking of the only Statute of the #european Deputies.
We are firmly convinced that the deputies to the European Parliament have been chosen by the population of the countries members to represent the interests of the constituents in the EU.
We consider that the fundamental points of this reform are an only remuneration, #one *imposición national public prosecutor and the repayment of the costs of trip with arrangement to the real costs.
It That regret a lot in the commitment is the fact that the States members to the hour to apply the guidelines have the possibility to introduce a claim of two months.
Only I #can wish that #a lot of States members do not take use of this possibility of the claim in two months as like this the consumers #would have the possibility to prolong the guarantee to two years.
On the other hand, #if the *OMC forced to the EU to liberalise totally the trade of bananas, #can warm up the absolute certainty that sooner or later it #would finish  with the diet of support to the community producers of banana.
The social question, #if well it appears with less sharpness in the commercial conflicts sees , unlucky and systematically prejudiced in the logic of the opening of the market #such as it prevails in these moments, is to say, without social and environmental norms.
It has got the moment to base the necessary international exchanges and the opening of the markets with other principles, with another frame that the that dictate the *OMC, the *GATT or the new cooperation *trasatlántica.
From these two examples, only #can ascertain that the agreements of the *GATT that gave origin to the World-wide Organisation of the Trade are hurtful for the interests of the citizens of the States members of the European Union.
I am fundamentally against of any type of army #european, of a police body European or of an identity of defence #european in the breast of the EU.
In *tercer place, the need to have national programs, and no only regional, to guarantee the coherence of the structural politics with the plans of ordination *plurianuales of the fleets.
Thus, I want to take advantage of the occasion and express to the Presidencies of the Council and, especially, to the German, my congratulations for having reached create a viable base for the final sprint.
With the new goals of help 1, 2 and 3 and the community initiatives *INTERREG, *LEADER, *EQUAL and *URBAN have of some effective instruments with the that we #can make an important contribution to the strengthening of the competitiveness of the regions and to the creation of places of work.
Nevertheless, in a wider context, is important to say today that in spite of #all the doubts that exist about #some details of the agreement *interinstitucional and of the financial perspective, is better to have *algo that it is lightly unsuitable in opinion of #some, but that already has been approved, that follow looking for the perfection and not achieving at all.
It will comprise it #if it is possible that the measures of accompaniment, that the costs for the rural areas impute  to the no compulsory costs, it that do not means that no *nos feel forced to that they have to spend, but elevates the *margen general of configuration of the Parliament for this increasing political.
