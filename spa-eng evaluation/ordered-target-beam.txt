Parliament, in fact: - *opuso to the *condicionamiento of Cohesion Bottom to the Stability Pact, because it believes that Cohesion Bottom has to be considered to #all the effects a structural instrument; - considered that Cohesion Bottom had to subject to norms on association that apply in the structural Bottoms and that operations scheduled, together with the structural operations, inside a frame integrated in the that they took part the regional and local administrations; Parliament wished likewise that in Cohesion Bottom took into account of mood that in the structural Bottoms the integration of horizontal subjects like employment and equality of opportunities; - asked that resources of Cohesion Bottom in the fields of transport and mobility used to fund projects that improved the regional cohesion and *interregional, interoperability and the *intermodalidad, and that in the field of the environment used besides to fund projects allocated to keep and recover biodiversity and to preserve the natural reservations; - underlined the importance to be able to group small projects in a greater entity and requested, therefore, that around the 5 % of the total financial endowment put to disposal of projects of this type.

Among so much, like the Assembly is to the so much, the main characteristic of the common position reached in the present managerial are fixation of a minimum tax of tax by vehicle to levels of the existent directive and without differentiation in accordance with *Euroclass, the maintenance of determined measures of transition on taxes of vehicles, the establishment of maximum types of taxes by utilisation of roads with a structure differentiated #such as it proposes it the Council, disposal of a #enabling power so that toll types #can differentiate according to broadcast class of vehicle and hour of utilisation day of road, disposal allocated to *Austria to apply toll in relation with the cost of infrastructure in tract that goes of *Kufstein to *Brenner and disposal of a 50 % of reduction of taxes by utilisation of roads for vehicles registered in #Grecia.
event like *Tampere, that woke up *tantas expectations, #can seem end in himself\/hisself same, but only is the beginning of a process. The Commission believes, nevertheless, that *Tampere transmitted the suitable message to audiences: to citizens, in the first place, that a subject *prioritario for his personal interests also wins importance among the political priorities of the Union; to the national administrations, that there #be not gone back backwards and that his own Bosses of Government have engaged to introduce improvements, included the institutional improvements of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, and to work as it is had to; to the world of delinquency, that the Union is *movilizando all potential to combat activities that are a threat for freedom and our welfare, and even for our democratic diets; and finally, to the external world, that an inwardly safe Union no means a Union fortress and that commitments with #that that need protection are holy.

On the other hand, the purpose manifested by the Commission -and that also is #worthy of *beneplácito- to elaborate annual reports on relations of the European Union with *Macao #would not have to dispense to the European Parliament to loan, to time, the greater attention to this subject, very in particular following regularly evolution from 20 December, tightening to #that *respecto information exchange and cooperation *interinstitucionales, creating his own group of contact, of mutual links, analysing and debating the periodic reports that *le present, appreciating, finally, the evolution of #all looks of the *coyuntura related with *Macao with seen to transformations of the international relations in Extreme Orient and of changes that announce in zone, without forgetting the new situations that it #can comport Chinese entrance in the *OMC and the evolution and\/or qualitative modification of relations with States Joined of *América.

(*SV) In the plan of common action that the EU and #EE.UU. signed in *Madrid on 3 December 1995, signal under the title "Reaction in front of global threats" the increase of collaboration in the fight against the illicit trade with drugs, cooperation measures among the competent #american authorities and *Europol, collaboration to give support to drug program of the UN, the coordination of programs of alternative development to combat the preparation of *estupefacientes and channel creation of cooperation among community organs as, for example, the European Centre for Drug Control and *Toxicomanías and the #Inter-American Commission for control of *drogodependencias.
To finalise, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, #if the European Commission wishes really contribute to development of the naval sector in *Europa, *le suffices with defending clearly the principle of the just trade during negotiations of the *OMC, leave to States members freedom to take part directly in this strategic sector to reorient technologically #some dockyards to segments of market with future, favour cooperation among companies to contribute to improve the global efficiency of each #one of dockyard types and, finally, in the frame of the common politics of fishing, adopt the decisions that are necessary to make possible a renewal controlled of fleet *pesquera, the *perpetuación of experience of dockyards and the vitality, gentleman President, of our dependent maritime regions of fishing.
After the wide internal debate celebrated in April of 1997, affirm in press conference the need to reform subsidy system, defence of a global approach, guaranteeing the maximum transparency and a greater control of #all costs, that, in case that #any of trip subsidies had to serve to compensate *algo, #would have to pay only trips sure enough facts and by the corresponding value to it that sure enough cost, consideration of distance and of transfer time by means of a *escalonamiento in stay subsidy with a new appropriate instrument; deputies to the European Parliament do not have to receive *emolumentos equal, but that they have to be in accordance with the situations *salariales of States members of origin of representatives chosen.
improvement of norms and of the financial organisation; -renewal of the upper levels of the parliamentary administration and introduction of new systems of promotion and of mobility to #all levels; -increase of the presence of women in direction places, although no still in proportion that to me *me had enjoyed can make; -regulation of transparency in the administrative decisions, to request of Defender of Village; -compilation and *clarificación of the existent norms so that, from now, deputies and civil servants know *cuales are rights and obligations, according to clear rules that avert the *arbitrismo or favour to friend.Also has achieved to resolve of satisfactory way the technical problems and of finance relative to buildings of *Bruselas, culminating like this obstinacy of my predecessors for endowing to facility deputies more functional and concentrated.
Gentleman President, take note and comprise sight point of the committee in his final considerations about that there #be not an only measure that #can treat the problem of mentality, but believe that a wide and clear strategy of reform, some effective mechanisms to reckon and insist *vigorosamente in the achievement of goals, the quality of the public service and the assessment of money, the vocational training in technicians and the ethical of the management, a promotion strictly *meritocrática, some just disciplinary procedures firm and reliable, the continuous emphasis in professionalism and #probity in school and in services #can *moldear mentality.
Parliament has taken a very clear position, since it has predicted that, before enlargement, have to make *obligatoriamente #some great institutional reforms #if we want to avert that *Europa convert only and exclusively in a big zone of *librecambio, prey of an extraordinary capacity of indecision by a regulation and by some obsolete internal rules. Has indicated likewise that no suffice the decisions on the vote by majority and the composition of the Commission to give a new impulse and a new strength to *Europa, but that it is necessary to take paths as, for example, the of the Letter of Fundamental Rights and of #some of things that had to join #all the big #european movement, logically, inside respect of nations, of feelings, of history, of tradition that consider very important.
How new answers contributes *usted to resistance thirst that, in front of career *desenfrenada by profitability is in #all *Europa, for example, in this same moment, in my country, to *través of the enormous movement of charm to workers of the group *Michelin that finishes to announce 7.500 suppressions of employment in *Europa, after having increased benefits in a 20 %?How new answers contribute *ustedes to those and to #that that expect that *Europa promote a real dynamics of alternatives to the globalisation of exclusion today in practice, already treat of employees, of peasants, of persons literate that argue the rules of the world-wide trade, or of two #guinean youngsters victims of the exodus of misfortune, without an international order that recognise to human being the right to life, to work and to the dignity?
Therefore, believe that -understanding totally even the narrow current mandate for the Conference in it that concerns to the review of the institutions as a result of the Treaty of *Amsterdam- it is necessary to tackle the necessary reform and in depth of our Court of Justice and of our Court of First Instance, reform of the nomination of judges -in the that Parliament has to have an important participation-, reform of competition cast among the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, so that citizen #can have an idea *cabal and clear of #which is this #european justice that also is his direct justice, and reform, in end -and #that already is of chapter- of the *justiciabilidad of acts.
How thing #can mean the proposals that listen, and that in general are collected in the report, on changes in the votes of the Council, on change of number, or of competitions, of commissioners, on decrease of the popular representation in the *PE after the increase of the number of states of the EU, but the *reforzamiento of the position of the rich countries of the EU, the *reforzamiento of the position of companies *monopolistas, that in his majority have headquarters in countries, the attempt to minimise resistance of villages, or even of the countries, to the *antipopulares resolutions of the EU that affect or #can affect even to national interests?
That it reestablish peace to allow political negotiations and the immediate end of the military aggression to a sovereign State are not horizons of this majority that before prefers to justify intervention of NATO, the *servilismo of the EU and of States in front of the strategic interests Americans, the *inobservancia of order and the international rights and of the Letter of Nations Joined, before prefers to defend climbing of war and the approval of political orientations that they have to put by strength in risk solve negotiated and the resolution of the relative fundamental questions to the regional autonomies and his ethnic minorities.
Of course revaluation effort of the Union in group concerns also to responsibilities of the European Parliament and of the Council -and #this also go it to argue with the new Commission- #as well as to *usted, a political guide that convert to the Commission in a strong speaker with regard to the great open questions and of the that depends the evolution and identity of the Union, some political questions that *revisten a big institutional importance, as *recalcaba, for example, Mr. President *Martens to hour to tackle the subject of relation among the Institutions regarding the institutional reforms, key subject of the next years.
To #that *respecto, have to stand out the principle of the mutual recognition of the decisions and sentences, to the that has to contribute the adoption of definitions and common sanctions in #all States members against some criminal activities of character *transfronterizo, as, for example, in the spheres of delinquency organised, of the illicit traffic of drugs, of the traffic of human beings or of delinquency against boys; have to stand out equally the creation of network *EUROJUST, that is without place to doubts the beginning of the construction of a judicial component of the European Union that it was instrument of support and of control of action of *EUROPOL with seen to guarantee the inner security and also defence instrument of the rights of the #european citizens.
Considers the Council that statements like the effected by Minister #danish of External Subjects, Mr. *Petersen, the one who affirmed that the decision quoted transmits the correct message that democracy and reform wish obtain his *recompensa, express sight point of the EU and of the designated international community on respect of freedoms and the fundamental democratic values, and that decision of #blackmailer character of *Luxemburgo is a "message" that promotes democracy, pushing to village and his political representatives, by means of the *coacción, to follow practices *antidemocráticas with the end to survive, in place to guarantee the normal democratic operation of the institutions in the next elections?
Takes fault a complete review of politics of the European Union that include and confront: democratisation of the World-wide Organisation of Trade; support to the familiar model of agriculture; the necessary mechanisms for the *dignificación of workers of the *Tercer World, so that it do not prejudice his productive and commercial statute; the protection of the environment; diffusion of technology in the poorest countries; treatment of the international debt of the feeblest countries; the protection of the cultural diversity of the planet in front of the *superpotencia North American of show.

Gentleman President, since the controversial decision of government #turkish that debate constitutes a case more of fault of respect and of rape of the right of the sea by part of *Turquía after the known decision of the Big National Assembly Turkish to empower to government #turkish to consider «*casus *belli» and declare war to #Grecia in the case that #Grecia exerted his legitimate right to expand the #greek territorial waters in accordance with the convention of the UN that only *Turquía has denied to sign, ask to the Council #if it proposes to signal also this subject in request to *Ankara and in conversations that, during the imminent European Council of *Helsinki, will keep, on relations of the European Union with *Turquía and on the criteria that #this, as *nos has said Mr. Minister, will have to fulfil.
Although regulation proposal of the Commission began to negotiate before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, in the Commission of Juridical Subjects -that approves in general regulation proposal, since it goes directed to delay disarmament of the *arbitrios #canarian and, therefore, has a protective function- think that after the entrance in vigour of article 299.2 it that proceeds is not a simple *suavización of limitation of the special treatment but paralyse the elimination of this special treatment because, predictably, in measures that have to propose the Commission for the regions *ultraperiféricas of compliance with said article 299.2, that foresees special measures in matter of fiscal politics, the Commission will allow predictably a small rearm so as to that the small local industries affected no result prejudiced.
Along months, of these last years, consider article 6 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam the reaffirmation of weight and of paper that in the European Union have the principles of freedom, of democracy, of respect of the human rights or, even, the constitution of the International Penal Court or the need that #all warn to give greater strength to article 7 of the Letter of the Organisation of Nations Joined with the object to be able to guarantee respect of the human rights preventing the exercise of the eventual humanitarian interferences to logics that are not linked pure and simply to respect of said rights: all #this *nos shows that they have made great progresses.

The Commission recommends with taste commitment amendments presented by the speaker, Mrs. *Jöns, relative to: add to article 1 the social integration in work market, to know, the amendment 1; the new formulation of the *tercer system of social economy in article 2, to know, the amendment 8; the importance that so much the Commission like Parliament consider that it has to attribute to the principles of equality of opportunities and of adaptability, to know the amendment 9; and the best conditions that proposes Parliament for the granting of small helps with disposals of special access for the no governmental organisations, to know the amendment 10.

Without embargo, *yo have the *convencimiento that event occurred in *Europa finished for giving the last impulse to the Government of Of *Klerk, constituted to finals of 1989, and *le allowed to gather the necessary value to open the doors to a radical change of the system and with *ello to his own disappearance. The fall of the wall of *Berlín, as last visible symbol of the end of a system, in #whose name had not defended precisely freedom and democracy in the *África *Austral, finished with the subjective perception of the *surafricanos white that #if they celebrated some democratic elections of compliance with the principle "*one *man, *one vote, eleven to vote " (man, vote, an only vote) #would finish living time in a system *monopartidista, and also in an economy *estatalizada, fruit of expropriation.
For example, enlargement of the Council "General Subjects" to defence ministers, formula already experienced the past Monday; the set up of a permanent political organ, the "*COPS" , commissioned to follow #all the relative questions to the external politics and of common security, included the relative to defence; the set up of a military committee; the creation of strength of fast intervention of some 50.000 men, etc., etc.; and do not forget that the Presidency #finnish has conceded importance to the improvement of the no military means of security, mainly to preventive title.
Have wanted that boss or *subjefe of cabinet was citizen of a distinct State of State of Commissioner and that in cabinet have persons of three States different members like minimum; the rules to appoint to the high civil servants will be more strict and transparent and inside the Commission will increase mobility of the high civil servants; the General Directions of the Commission will identify with brief and clear denominations, instead of with numbers; will create a stronger service in the sector of means and of the communication to guarantee that politics of the Commission take public with professionalism, so as to get to #all the #european citizens.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0033\/1999) of Mr. *Harbour in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market on the common position of the Council ((8697\/1\/1999 - *C5-0031\/1999 - 1998\/0071 (*COD)) relative to directive proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Directive of the Council 70\/221\/*CEE of the relative Council to approximation of legislations of States members on the deposits of liquid fuel and devices of rear protection of vehicles to engine and of trailers.
Second, is equally desirable and urgent the voluntary participation of workers in capital of company, so much as it indicates it the speaker in amendment 12 to the guidelines for employment, and *ello by two reasons. In the first place, by reasons funded relative to the need to improve the endowment of own capital of companies to resist to the *imposiciones of the great bottoms of investment and protect employment, but also by a human reason that resides in the evolution of work places with future, the *cuales that demand training level increasingly high and a personal commitment that only #can take advantage of and boost intelligently by means of the participation.
In the first place appears the concept of public health that have interpreted of wide form of compliance with the definition of the World-wide Organisation of Health -health is a state of physical welfare, mental and social total- in line, therefore, also with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, #as well as the same concept of violence that covers looks quoted: violence no only is rape of the psychic and physical integrity of the that the suffer, but that constitutes a grave social damage that prejudices, cost redundancy, to #all, is to say, to the victim, the aggressors and citizens.
Of way more general, do not believes the Commission -seen crisis situations and the increasing threat that represent the numerous diets *antidemocráticos present in this region of the world- that development of a strategic relation, political, economic and cultural among the EU and Indian -the most populated democracy of the world- #would allow to join, of significant and exemplary way, in an alone political, the will to establish political and economic relations privileged with the countries governed by the principles and the rules of democracy and of Right State, #as well as economic and commercial interests very understood?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, results *reconfortante that in a so important negotiation like the of the World-wide Organisation of Trade the fifteen States members have adopted a common position to establish, in the field of agriculture, game rules stable that allow a loyal competition in the world-wide stage and confront with clarity the challenges of the new #millenium, since they have taken like central base the positions adopted in day in diary of the agriculture agreement of the Round *Uruguay and in Diary 2000 of *Berlín, #as well as the maintenance *multifuncional of agriculture.
In relation with libraries and the promotion of democracy and culture, the Council leaves proof that in article 151 of the Treaty of the Union indicates that the community efforts to boost the cultural development in States members, respecting his national and regional diversity, have to orient to boost collaboration among States members and, #if it is necessary, support and complete activities -in the first place- to improve and spread knowledges on history and culture of the #european villages -second- to conserve and protect the *acervo cultural that have meant for *Europa -in *tercer place- for cultural exchange no commercial and -in chamber place- for the artistic and literary creation, included the audiovisual sector.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate on the recommendation (To5-0023\/1999) for the *segunda reading, in name of the Commission of Culture, Education, Media and Sport, on decision proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council (8076\/1\/1999 - *C5-0024\/1999 - 1996\/0130(*COD)), by the that modifies the Directive of relative base to program #Socrates with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios, and on decision proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council (8077\/1\/1999 - *C5-0025\/1999 - 1996\/0131(*COD)), by the that modifies the Decision of relative base to program Youth with *Europa *III with the end to include to *Turquía among the countries *beneficiarios (Speaker: Mr. *Gargani).
And is it because, although *Turquía is a country that has shown #any difficulty in terrain - *le confess, gentleman President, that in the commission has listened echo of this problematic, of this difficulty to hour to accept this idea in the #european field, in the *Europa so opened to culture, as they have reiterated along #all the afternoon the distinct orators in speeches on the four measures that, in mood, are interrelated - believe that this decision will carry to describe to *Europa in whole like a group of States that watches to the new countries of open way and with big dignity and offers great possibilities of development from sight point of freedom and of culture.
In fact, in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission in the that it examined #all this sector of the auxiliary doctors and in period of training put of relief seven looks that require the adoption of immediate measures: the excessive labour day in #some countries; the question of policemen; fixation of turns little realistic; prolonged periods of permanent service; distribution of services among the auxiliary doctors and the upper doctors; the no official pressures that suffer doctors in period of training; the vulnerability of rest periods in front of pressure of the necessary service.
Lady deputy, although the Council -say it very on purpose to the principle- concedes really a big importance to measures for the promotion of equality of opportunities among men and women and to the concrete application of the corresponding disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, it that it is applicable to #all the organisations, institutions and corporations that know in *Europa, from the European Parliament until the Commission and also to Council, lamentably, have to *indicarle that roots exclusively in the field of responsibilities of the States members propose to members of the European Commission of compliance with disposals of the Treaties and that the distribution of tasks inside the Commission is, by it other, an internal subject of the Commission.
Have to react it before possible, especially by what know substances that exhaust ozone coat: the *hidroclorofluorocarburos (*HCFC), used mainly in facilities of refrigerated and of air conditioned, as dissolvent and for plastic production *esponjados of isolation; methyl bromide, allocated mainly to fumigation of crop earths to combat the harmful animals and illnesses of plants, classified by the WHO in the category of substances "highly poisonous" ; chlorofluorocarbons (*CFC), used in refrigeration systems and used before in plastic manufacture *esponjados, of dissolvent and like gases *propelentes for aerosols; the *halones use to combat fires, in particular in areas #where fire extinction is subjected to hard controls of quality (specifically in planes), and in products of replacement no dangerous.

Had account that the Report #Adam on the nuclear security approved in the past month of March by Plenary, asked, among things, that limited reactor employment *RBMK, #as well as of construction reactors #soviet *VVER that now the #czech authorities have foreseen to use in *Temelin, subscribe the conclusions presented by the spokesman of delegation of national Alliance and speaker for opinion, that have served like corollary to the Report #Adam; to know: first, security is the fundamental element of the strategy of *preadhesión; second, has to reinforce the international rule in matter of systems of security; third, control on the application of said normative has to entrust to an independent organism.
States members agree in that it is necessary to avert contradictions among the Convention project and among performance guidelines elaborated by the Union, as they are, for example, measures of common action adopted on 3 December 1998 regarding money bleaching, recognition of the instruments and benefits of offences, methods of persecution, bottom freezing and embargo sentences and expropriation, and also measures adopted on 21 December 1998 on the *involucración of the authorities in the criminal activities.
More intense has to be #ours worry in front of the attempts to avert and to substitute Gin convention, that is the basic source of International Right by the that govern refugees, with the approval of a "diet of provisional protection", and also in front of considerations on the modification of the Agreement of *Dublín on asylum, on hardening of legislation relative to processing procedure of asylum requests, and on the most effective application "" of the procedures to move away to persons #whose requests of residence are refused
#This is reason by the *cual the Commission of Public Freedoms proposed that, from now, in the field of asylum politics and of immigration have two budgetary instruments: the first, a #european bottom for refugees allocated to fund of a structural way the necessary measures for the received, integration and the voluntary repatriation of refugees in case of a normal flow; and the second, #one *segunda budgetary line to allow the adoption of measures of emergency in case of massive influx of refugees.
Gentleman President, commitment of the European Union, confirmed in the Report *Schwaiger, in favour of the creation of a permanent forum of work among the International Organisation of Work and the World-wide Organisation of Trade to treat of the subjects related with trade, globalisation and work is the only road to accompany liberalisation of trade and exchanges in general to respect to the fundamental rights of work, without dropping in the selfish protectionism and *hipócrita or in the disloyal competition and *autodestructiva.
Is necessary that Parliament say, before that the Council decide the creation of organ commissioned to draft Letter project, that #can not accept a number of representatives of the European Parliament inferior to the of the representatives of Government bosses of States members and that ask an attentive query before deciding #if the essential contribution of the national parliaments has to guarantee through the participation of a true number of representatives in the planned organ or through other more effective channels.

Has foreseen the Council keep decision on the review and request to the Commission that guarantee that airports in Goal zones *nº 1 and zones of Goal *nº 1 in transition do not see prejudiced by the loss of income like result of the suspension of the free sales of taxes, it that inevitably will conduct to a rise of prices for consumers, the loss of benefits for the aerial lines, companies of maritime transport, ports and airports, and that encloses a threat for employment in the sectors and the small companies that supplied products to the free shops of taxes?
Think, without embargo, that in the following questions #can not coincide with Parliament: fusion of the humanitarian help and of assistance to reconstruction in an only organism, separation of income of the Agency of credits assigned to programs, exclusion of the contributions of sources of the budget of the Agency, the approval of endowment of personnel by part of the budgetary Authority and a report on the possible settlement of the Agency to cape of 24 months.

Gentleman President, *Señorías, after the report published the year happened on *Turquía by colleagues the *Srs *Macmillan-#Scott and *Swoboda, #as well as the resolution of Parliament of the past 6 October, that put of relief the importance of the deepening of the #european strategy bear with country, our Assembly #would have to can adopt tomorrow two proposals of regulation of Parliament and of the relative Council to the execution of actions directed to the economic and social development of *Turquía, the first, and to the deepening of the Union *Aduanera among the European Community and *Turquía.

Lady Speaker, this report contains #some interesting confessions: read in the considering *F that exists a persistent differential of growth with States Joined; in the considering *J read that the very high fiscal pressure of the majority of the #european States no favours neither consumption, neither growth neither employment; in paragraph 4, the speaker recognises, with reason, the modest performance of the European Union in terms of growth and of employment; in paragraph 16, ascertains that the public investments no always enjoy of preference concerning operation costs; in paragraph 23, the speaker says that it is convenient to keep #alert in front of eventual perspectives *deflacionarias.

support of the Commission to reconstruction and to development #would have to centre then in the following fields: in the first place, the establishment of right state and democratisation of the national institutions; second, demobilisation and the socioeconomic reintegration of the belligerent groups; in *tercer place, the restoration of the environment, especially in the provinces of *Kivu and *Orientale; in chamber place, reconstruction of transport infrastructure; and finally, the improvement of health services and sanitary.

#If I have accepted, finally, *adherirme to the resolution that will subject to vote of colleagues, is because I have been able to *percatarme of the true emotional state of part of the world-wide public opinion; worries, joined to the words pronounced previously on the reaction of Government #japanese and of other international organisms, that ask to the populations that take cautions, that procure reservations of foods, in forecast of this end of the world announced, *me confirm in the idea that cautions *preconizadas by Parliament are, because of prudence, able to appease fears, and, therefore, #can be useful.

Have seen that the EU occupies of sectors and questions that now affect to lives of citizens of the European Union of form very direct: the launching of the euro, that early will not be a simple instrument for the banks and the institutions, but also coins and notes that will carry in the pocket citizens, and this week the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with his greater insistence in politics that affect to citizens and, in particular, in the creation of places of work.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0225\/99) of Mrs. *Sandbaek in name of the Delegation of the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee on the conjoint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Directive 89\/398\/*CEE relative to approximation of legislations of States members on the alimentary products allocated to a special feeding (3607\/99 - *C4-0154\/99-99\/0076(*COD))
The fact to have in the core of the system of the taking of decisions an organism of representatives of complete time with #all diversity that represent, calling to the doors, taking #telephone calls, taking uncomfortable questions, *sondeando, interrogating, studying in detail the subjects and going back to the regions to talk of *ello with interest groups, the unions, employers, consumer groups and the local governments in regions.
Now well, agreement of *Berlín has remained still very far of the positions of the European Parliament: do not has *reequilibrado the *PAC properly in the sense of equity and cohesion, the disadvantaged and peripheral regions follow loomed of depopulation and desertisation, have not created conditions to apply in practice the #european model of agriculture, have not created conditions so that the European Union present with an offensive posture in the next negotiations of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
The disloyal competition to the that confronts the sector -a sector that goes, on the other hand, from fibre production, *hilados and tissues, until the of finishings-, sees aggravated, besides, by barriers *arancelarias and no *arancelarias that #all norms established in breast of the World-wide Organisation of Trade prevent access to country markets like Indian, States Joined or #the same *Turquía, as #if norms only governed for the community markets, to the that these countries -products of these countries- yes #can access freely.
Leave that States members reduce VAT in services with a big component of hand of drama and that do not have repercussions *transfronterizas; renew upsetting that takes in investigation and development and take a more imaginative use of money of the European Bank of Investments, for example, with the creation of credit line #european for technology; introduce changes in the organisation and work time with the end to share better the available work.
From the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, on 1 May, the procedure of *codecisión, that supposes the maintenance of narrow relations among Parliament, the Commission and the Council, covers at present a wide series of politics that comprise #among others transport sector, the regional subjects, the social subjects, the initiatives for employment, the structural Bottoms, the protection of consumer, the public health and the environmental looks.
It that *sucedió after the referendum deserves the greater conviction, of course, because Indonesian executed a plan of genocide that #can not leave doubt #any on nature: demographic genocide, promoting hundred escape of thousands of *timorenses; cultural genocide, because from the *primer day of terror the central white, from sight point of the institutions, went the #catholic Church, the temples, the episcopalian houses, parents, the sisters, the faithful, is to say, the traditional institution in that the *timorenses deposited confidence.
Want to take advantage of the opportunity that *me offers the presence here today of Commissioner to propose - to the light of the exceptions that already exist in the European Union for the audiovisual companies, that *nos leave a true *margen of manoeuvre, that *nos offer besides the capacity to evolve with the sector and to take gesture after some rules of the game more *equitativas regarding States Joined - that, when building infrastructure for negotiations, have to be the sufficiently flexible to watch by our needs here in *Europa.
The Council has time for reflection and the decision on means: time for reflection because *nos will gather on 25 November - by Saint #Catalina tree ruins and expect that the budgetary tree throw roots -, and the decision on means *le corresponds to *usted, lady Speaker - and colleagues, since I know that it #can not it all and regret it -, choose among two roads: the review of the financial perspectives of category 4 that *nos will allow to vote this budget facing up to the new priorities of compliance with commitments that have assumed during negotiation of this agreement.
In meeting of 16 July, the Budget Council treated of the reallocation of endowments in favour of *Kosovo and in moment said that the Commission #would not have to prejudice to the less developed countries and to the poorest groups and remembered also commitment assumed by the Commission with the international strategy for development, #whose goal is the to reduce to half poverty in the world of here to the year 2015.
On the other hand, wish to take reference to speakers that have to take into account in dialogue *macroeconómico and *yo *me *atrevería to suggest that it is necessary to incorporate three more: the representatives of two institutions of the own European Union, as they are the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions -two institutions that represent an economic and social dimension of a big importance and, in the case of the regions, obviously, #some of *ellas play an absolutely indispensable paper to ensure these goals- and, finally, small and medium enterprise organisations.
In this sense, is necessary to review the feasibility of technology, because they still are control devices of broadcasts able to answer to the strict limits of oxides of nitrogen; although in laboratory proofs devices promise a lot, still there #be not security of the operative efficiency on a long-term basis of devices that the convert in a possible technical solution and durable to make control of broadcasts in the long term.
The first are the agreements in matter of investments based in the principles of the statement of the *OIT on companies multinationals and the guidelines of the *OCDE on the rights of workers. The second is the constitution of a mixed permanent forum *OMC\/*OIT commissioned to examine the inclusion of the fundamental labour rights, as for example the abolition of work *forzoso and slavery, proscription of the childish work, the prohibition of discrimination.
The Report *Schwaiger loads *comprensiblemente more the accent in the *tutelas, nevertheless, believe that it shows a substantial tuning with the proposal of the Commission and, therefore, a full confidence in the work of Commissioner Mr. *Lamy also regarding this delicate subject, always with consciousness that liberalisation of exchanges also in new fields - as in the case of investments - answers to the important interest of the countries of the European Union and of #all the countries by a durable and sustainable development of the world-wide economy.
Although the Conservative Party British *opone officially in principle to that in virtue of article 63 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam move to the *primer *pilar politics in matter of visas, immigration and asylum -by which *me see forced to be in disagreement with it that has said speaker about this question-, instead are resolved adherents that it have cooperation *intergubernamental in relation with the *tercer *pilar by means of the collective action of the Council about exchange of information type, included the related with trip documents falsified, to end to struggle against delinquency and in particular against the international delinquency that do not respects the national borders.
Of #where have to take out the conclusion that it #can not in fact work of way that the that there #be, as we argue on legal bases, debate absurdly on illegal immigration - #this is very well for Congress of the Party *Tory, but is not effective in *Europa -, and lose from sight point the opportunity to take it that necessarily #would have to, #this is, an effective legislation to limit document fake so much by #that that like this buy way to go in illegally in *Europa as also by #that #others that, as it has explained very well Mrs. *Gebhardt, circulate by *Europa with heroine case and false documents.
And #if integration of *Turquía to the European Union answers to the requirements of the great industrial groups and commercial, especially #european and accessorily #turkish, will not contribute to improve conditions of the hard-working mass of this country, of mood that the Union has not protected of unemployment and of degradation of existence conditions to workers of the already integrated countries.
To the light of #that *dictamen of the Scientific Committee on Health and the Animal Welfare, the Commission - to #mine initiative in meeting of 28 October- approved a decision in the that proposed a permanent prohibition of commercialisation and utilisation of the *BST in the Community from 1 January 2000, of compliance with disposals established in the Decision 98\/58\/*CE of the Council on the protection of breeding animals.
And reiterate that security in the sector of transports has to be a priority in the #european politics of transports and, therefore, ask, as I took in a question to the Commission, that the own Commission elaborate in the short term, better said, urgently a directive on the systems of compulsory security for the tunnels and road galleries and underline the fundamental importance of a directive that establish the protocols and controls in road of the reliability of the commercial vehicles that circulate by roads of *Europa.
By #all reasons, urge to the European Parliament to that it approve a resolution in the that signals to attention of entities of Indonesian the need to reestablish the legality, the need to finish with slaughterings, the need that strengths armed defend to the populations and no the attack, the need to release to *Xanana *Gusmãor, the need that Nations Joined follow supporting the management that has taken *Portugal so that it reestablish peace in *Timor Oriental and in #all Indonesian.
Gentleman President, all #that that read in history book on the recent past of *Camboya and all #that that have had luck, among *comillas, to take trip by country, #can not conceive that at all it have manifested the intention to create an international court to judge to the authors of the *killing *fields and of the massacre that, as very well has signalled Mr. *Bourlanges, constitutes #one of the most regrettable crimes *acecidos after the *segunda world-wide war.
This situation has to to a large extent to that the simplest tasks have disappeared of societies, to that differences in performance of persons are enormously and to that determined labour activities are *remunerando with wages truly exaggerated, even #if activities #can in fact result more productive in the traditional sense of the term, in case that they followed forming part of the labour market; but all #this no results of any acceptable way from a point of social sight or of respect to the human dignity.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished colleagues in a period of big agitation, was by conflict of *Kosovo, was by any #another, have in the European Parliament once again the obligation to talk of a subject that *nos comes occupying from takes long, the commercial fight with the #EE.UU. States Joined insist in posture, was in the case of bananas that perhaps to mood to see was solved, was now in the case of hormones, in the that it is extraordinarily difficult to put measure in spot so that also out of the European Union #can comprise, as the *disensiones commercial of the that treats here constitute hardly the 2 % of the common trade.
#Many of *nosotros, therefore, expected that today *usted, to move away the #sad and unfair initial coincidence that hangs on his new mandate and after 40 days of war in *Kosovo, *Montenegro, Serbian and *Voivodina, #would find the appropriate words to take a call to the immediate #alto fire, and the words of solidarity by #all the innocent victims, of #all parts involved, #as well as practical proposals for reconstruction of the territories devastated and for the fast return of refugees: research, gentleman President *Prodi, of a #european soul, as it said day in Plenary.
A formal convergence, by the contrary, conducts to unconformities in the results of politics.2.An only economic politics, managed by the Union, constitutes a grave rape of the national independence and rape of the national parliaments. The prerogatives of #this in matters of economic politics constitute an indispensable part of the #democracia.3.la political defended in the report (and in the speech) represents a unilateral theoretical thought and a singular political theory.
To which adds that the Council also has *infringido doubly the spirit and the sense of the Treaty, since, with the introduction of an extraordinary tax allocated to adapt income of the #european deputies to the national diets *desvirtúa the goal of the Treaty to establish deal equality among the #european deputies and goes back to introduce inequality by the rear door, for saying it like this.
The explanation of #some administrative services that already we had to it have known the past week and that we had to have anticipated and thought it that we wanted to take #can be very interesting from sight point of the juridical theory, but is not of receipt that today have a first reading, that the report send to Transport Commission, that to time do not gathers, and that the administrative service modify my report of the past week and declare that there #be a report for the *segunda reading.
In the text *nos have agreed with the Council that before the approval of the budget of the European Union always take place a meeting *tripartita additional, in the that among the Council, Parliament and the Commission agree form in the that #can cover an eventual need -the past year had help to *Rusia- with resources no released of the common budgetary year or also how have to treat needs of the consecutive budgetary year and how have to *ponernos entirely of agreement before the approval of the Budget.
Gentleman President, is natural that exist fields in the that *nos had enjoyed to get more far after two years of negotiations about the #european regional help for the next seven years. Fits to mention, #among others, some clearer commitments, frames of association by part of the local and regional authorities, more guarantees still for respect of terms in payment to contractors of projects and the establishment of a specific figure for the capital of social risk in favour of the voluntary organisations smaller.
While we follow expecting the adoption of concrete measures directed to respect the agreements *multilaterales on the environment -in particular, on the climate and biodiversity- or to reflect in facts the decisions of the Summit of *Copenhague in matter of fight against poverty, the committees of the *OMC impose law to democracies -and, in particular, to the European Union- and gives to freedom of exchanges the priority on #all the considerations, already treat of public health, environment, human rights or social rights.
In the meeting Council of Justice and Interior of 3 December 1998 approved performance plan of the Commission and the Council with regard to the effective application of points of the Treaty of *Amsterdam for the creation of a #european space of freedom, justice and security; among measures to carry out in the next two years contemplates the editorial of a list of the countries, #whose citizens will be able to travel to States members of the EU without visa, and of the countries that will need it.
In front of this situation, diet no only do not shows a minimum will to initiate political and economic reforms, but that, by the contrary, reinforces the submission of the population *norcoreana and keeps a total control on expert missions and on the medical and alimentary help supplied by the international community to the population *norcoreana (600.000 tonnes of cereals in 1998 and 530.000 in 1999) to the not allowing to the international organisations verify utilisation and efficiency of help.
In this sense had been unforgivable that, *cuando in *Sudáfrica dismantles diet *odioso, *cuando the #south african take history and give example producing an admirable reconciliation, surpassing with hit the always difficult transition of a civil war and dictatorship, transition of diagrams of release movement to the constitution of a Been pluralist, democratic and of Right, had been scandalous, say, that *cuando *ellos, the #south african, have not defrauded confidence in behaviour, *nosotros Europeans did not know to be to the height of the circumstances and defrauded confidence that from *África of the South has deposited in *nosotros.
Subject: On the possible suppression of the General Direction of Fishing Is true - as they finish to announce the media - that, in spite of the word given by the Agriculture Commissioner *Fischler in appearance in front of Fishing Commission of the European Parliament, the European Commission has decided to suppress the General Direction of Fishing (General Direction *XIV), measure that prejudices clearly to the interests *pesqueros #european and, especially, to the interests of dependent regions of fishing, as it is the case of *Galicia?
To follow forward with politics contrary to pity capital, to consolidate attainments of the Committee of Human Rights and to carry the question of death pity to program of the General Assembly of Nations Joined, States members of the European Union have resolved to present a resolution in the Third Commission during the *quincuagésimo chamber period of sessions of the General Assembly.
#would Be #naïve, clear, expect a distinct approach by part of organisms of the EU, *cuando the community budget and the national budgets move in the hard and *antipopular mark of the criteria of *Maastricht and of the *draconianas reductions of costs; *cuando the external politics of the EU characterises by hypocrisy that did not knows limits, by control more *opresivo, and by the every time greater submission of the countries, #as well as by the open intervention and generalised in his internal subjects, as they show the enlargement process and the Stability Pact for the *Europa *suroriental.
conception #would conduct directly, according to the ancient professional deformation of the Commission, to concede the primacy to the free circulation of commodities on health of consumers, as we finish to see in the subject of the embargo of meat of bovine #british, in the that it #would be necessary, lady Speaker, expect to that have of proofs, it that *nos conducts, by it other, to the extraordinary following conclusion: the that inside the European Union did not applies the principle of caution, whereas it tries to take that it prevail in relations with third countries, in particular with States Joined.
The Commission also #can support the relative amendments to enlargement of the directive to include other alternative fuels, in east marry ethanol; the amendment that refers to the fiscal incentives applied to the *reequipamiento of old vehicles; the amendment that includes the heavy vehicles in the community general strategy referred to carbon dioxide and the relative amendment to the commercial quality of the liquid petrol.
Has had knowledge the Commission of the opening of investigation, or of appeal of information or of recommendations to reach agreements, by part of State Department of the #EE.UU., directed to the Group Sun-*Meliá, with previous character to the application to this group and to companies of the EU (Club *Med, *LTU), in frank rape of the Agreements reached among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the frame of the Transatlantic Summit, that excluded of the field of application of the Law *Helms-*Burton to the #european companies?
#If we split of premise that a world-wide trade freer and more just has been the foundation that has allowed to improve welfare level of States and populations, especially in the case of the countries in development, then also have to recognise that the European Union, in quality of greater commercial power of the world, has an elementary interest in continuing promoting this favourable evolution and in that an increasing number of villages and of States take part in #the same.
To measure that increases the number of international competitors in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, precisely in the rich nations and especially in States Joined, that are those who more have benefited of liberalisation of the markets, is -paradoxically, wanted to add *yo- scepticism and worry in front of the possibility that globalisation also carry rigged impoverishment, the destruction of the environment and the loss of national sovereignty.
The Commission of Budgetary Control proposes to answer in opinion writing to the *interrogante on the suitability to tackle development of controls and an effective protection of the community finances by means of the creation of public prosecutor charge #european according to diagram proposed in the "*Corpus *Juris" , but in the sense of subsidiariness, #such as *nos posed and cleared the past week in the session of *Bruselas gentleman Commissioner *Barnier.
have achieved to pose with considerable clarity and of consistent way the political requirements associated to cooperation with *Turquía, in particular the need that they respect and develop the human rights, among *ellos the rights of village *kurdo, the requirement of the abolition of death pity, the strengthening of the civil society, a greater participation of the no governmental organisations and the reduction of the social disadvantages and of the regional underdevelopment.
In this sense, tomorrow will propose -to the contrary of it that, apparently, think #others- postponement of the vote of the two reports for a period of back sessions and ask to Speaker of the European Parliament that, in name of the institution that chairs, formulate request expresses to the European Council of *Helsinki so that, #if it keeps the decision of the #turkish authorities, the Council adopt a very firm position in relation with the candidature of *Turquía to the European Union.
Without leaving to respect confidentiality of conversations, *yo #can *decirles, in any case, that my personal impression is that Government #turkish did not wishes to take in any case a decision on the execution of sentence while it last the procedure of *Estrasburgo, but that strategy is directed rather to take advantage of the time like this won for abolish death pity in *Turquía.
But believe that no *le #can dribble to the Presidency in exercise of the Council merit that they have produced substantial advances in the field of the external politics and of common security reorganising works of the Council, giving a clear impulse to the no military management of the crisis, adopting the common strategy on the case of *Ucrania and adopting also a statement in the case of *Chechenia, although to *nosotros *nos had enjoyed that it went a bit more conclusive and believe that time *nos will give reason.
Also suits to remember that, in the report of the Court of Accounts that finishes of #make and that have debated this week, have not found in #all the agricultural sector any indication of massive swindle or fraud on a large scale, but have observed that seems to have *muchísimos problems to hour to reckon the number of livestock, the quantity of hectares by help to surface, etc. Exist small errors in a very wide field and *eso constitutes a grave problem that owe *encarar.
Have to say again that the political intentionality of the Treaty was the to integrate the Secretariat of *Schengen existent in the also existent General Secretariat of the Council without hiring new collaborators or summon procedures of selection of any type, as it #can not be reasonable that #if a task has been made up to now by a Secretariat that goes to be integrated afterwards in #another, solvent the subject planting to 80 new persons according to norms applicable to the general Secretariat and that put in the street to the 80 persons that have taken until then work of the Secretariat of *Schengen.
In the European Union today, for well or for bad, although it still have national cultural traditions, the basic principles, the principles of public order, the principles of the protection of morals, of the right and of minors, follow valid and, therefore, believe that, in this moment, really a directive like the current goes to facilitate integration of legislations by means of defence of some common principles to #all States members.
Lady minister, from the past 11 February, in that it reacted in front of the first informations on slaughterings in *Kosovo, Parliament no has ceased of reporting the atrocities committed in this province, in the that unchained once again the *infernal gear of violence and of fear, cause of *tantos sufferings by the systematic rape of the most elementary rights of human being, in first row of the *cuales appears the to remain in the floor that has seen it be born and conserve culture in the that has raised.
This approach of the interior of the crisis that crosses the Commission (crisis to the that confront #all the #european institutions) #would contribute, in my opinion, to situate effectively the analysis of the independent experts in his global political context, characterised (to use the terms of the document of the mentioned Cell of *Prospectiva) by the exhaustion of form to organise the public action, by a crisis of authority that affects of full to the Union.
In category *I "agricultural costs, support to the markets" are already to the limit of the *margen; in category *IV "external actions" - will go back on *ello - category literally explodes, in category *V do not know it that will cost the administrative reform of the Commission, but see with worry how outlines the problem of retirements without that have foreseen costs adapted; and in category *VII allocated to the *preadhesión, movement in favour of a faster enlargement and wider, #if it #can say like this, do not enjoys of credits adapted.
The Scientific Committee has shown clearly his *convencimiento that meat of bovine #british is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of part of the European Union and in these circumstances am safe that Commissioner will suit *conmigo in that delay of only days is better that the of two or three years in the courts, it that finishes frustrating to #everyone, do not satisfies to nobody and, in particular, do not satisfies to graziers #british that have observed the law, have taken it that *les has asked and are now in conditions to sell an excellent product in #all the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0056\/1999), in name of Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities, concerning the common position, approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to action program community (Program *DAPHNE) (2000-2003) on preventive measures allocated to combat violence exerted on boys, teenagers and women [<lpar>$^9150<num>$/^1<num>$/^1999<num>$-^*C$^5<num>$-^0181<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1998<num>$/^0192<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> (Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea).
Believe that it is just to affirm that it exists general consensus in the European Union - among the Council, Parliament and the Commission - on the two following proposals: in the first place, in spite of the comprehensible indignation by the appalling acts of terrorism in *Moscú, in the *Cáucaso North and in parts - that like citizen of a country that has suffered *demasiadas experiences of terrorism condemn totally -, the #russian action during the last weeks has supposed a reiterated deployment of a disproportionate military strength, the reiterated contempt of the need to look for a political solution and the reiterated contempt of the tragic consequences for persons.
Without embargo, fifty years after the Universal Statement of the Human Rights, know that no exist rights conquered #all at the same time and for ever: think in the *Tíbet, *Birmania, *Timor and in the #asian countries in that it explodes the childish and feminine work; think in *Kosovo, in *Chechenia or in *África, a continent *demasiadas far times and forgotten; think in the 790 millions of persons that happen *hambre in the world or in the 300 millions of boys that are forced to work; think, besides, in the 1.625 executions fulfilled the year happened in the 72 countries that in legislations keep death pity; finally think in destination of the leader *kurdo *Ocalan, #whose life has to be saved by means of effort of #all *nosotros.
And all *ello because, although Parliament has expressed an indeclinable commitment in favour of a moratorium of death pity, as we took in the debate of the last session *plenaria -believe that Speaker has directed already to the #turkish authorities by reason- think that the European Union has to fulfil commitments and, to time, that #can not leave to recognise that in the last fifteen years in *Turquía has not executed death pity.
is not only the case *Ocalan that *me takes to say that the candidature of *Turquía is not mature still. Among things, *Ocalan went practically delivered by the Government of Mr. *D' *Alema -#one dishonours for #Italia- but, on the other hand, precisely of the penal Code Italian *Turquía has copied article 155 of his penal Code that has allowed conviction of *Ocalan - article 155 of the penal Code Turkish, copied of article 241 of the penal Code Italian- and, therefore, also the position of the #italian Government in this case no *me has *extrañado at all.
Report (To5-0074\/1999) of Mr. *Pronk, in name of the Delegation of Parliament for the conciliation Commission on the text attach, approved by the Conciliation Commission, on directive proposal of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of health and of security of workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres. (Commission of Social Subjects and Employment, *Décima *quinta managerial individual relative to article 16(1) of the Directive 89\/391\/*CEE (*C5-0221\/1991 - 1995\/0235(*COD))
will Signal that, from fifteen years ago, in *Turquía exists a moratorium in fact on death pity; that the goal of the report that, precisely, subject to vote is to incite to Government #turkish to that this moratorium in fact convert in moratorium of right; and that, in any case, *me ask #which #would be the reaction of colleagues #if, in countries of origin, existed, as *ellos wish, intrusion of the political power in the judicial power. since at present the cause of Mr. *Ocalan is subjected to the Court of Security of *Estrasburgo.
The technical obstacles that #would pose the greater difficulties to reduce the transitory period are, specifically: manufacture terms of notes and of coins in euros; the considerable importance of the computer adaptations that they have to make , and also the fact that the transition to the euro of the public administrations has been scheduled for the year 2002, to end to take in consideration the complexity of changes that have to introduce in this sector.
Of compliance with article 245 of the constitutive Treaty of the *CE, with article 45 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of Coal and Steel and with article 160 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community of the Atomic Energy, the Council #can change disposals on the maintenance of secret only to request of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0101\/1999) of Mr. *Papayannakis, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer, on regulation proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council that modifies the Regulation (*CE) *nº 820\/97 of the Council by the that it establishes identification system and register of animals of the bovine species and relative to labeling of meat of *vacuno and products to base of meat of *vacuno (*COM(1999) 487 - *C5-0241\/1999 - 1999\/0205(*COD)).
By evident reasons, that have relation with geography but also with history, seemed necessary to Europeans engage, during the years 70, cooperation action of *envergadura with the countries of *África, of the *Caribe and of the Peaceful, under a quite original form known with the name of Agreement of *Lomé, and that allowed that partners of the south benefited of stable prices for products of the that extract his main resources, *ello to coat of a free change in directions of the that it only that sees is how ruins today the most fragile economies.
*Ustedes will remember appointment: «day will happen to history like infamy day», and *ello because the Secretary of North American State, that was perfectly to the common, took to expect in antechamber during varied hours to ambassador #japanese that had attended to deliver war statement, with the only goal to take out party of indignation by attack in front of the North American public opinion and international.
As I believe that it always is possible attenuate the negative effects, stand out three: reform of the *PAC, to the that associate the feeble expression of the concept of «rural development», as the benefited and prejudiced go to follow, at the end, being #the same of always; the reduction of the public copartnership in private projects producers of income that, when prejudicing to companies, lessen employment; bottom concentration of the next community frame in the first years, that, together with the balances that go out of *él, will create complex conditions of utilisation of the structural Bottoms, as known is that, #if they do not use, lose.
Likewise wanted to express the opinion shared by the absolute majority of the Commission of Public Freedoms and of Inner Subjects that no treats of the rights of Parliament, by important that are, but that Parliament pretends *erigirse in lawyer of the fundamental rights, the rights of citizens and the rights of person in the European Union. Now well, results enormously difficult to assume this have to that we have to fulfil of face to the #european citizens *cuando the Council *nos excludes of activities.
Without embargo this question follows without answer and is: -#If it knows the Council that, in accordance with complaints and informations that spread the international media, bombardments of NATO and war of *Yugoslavia have caused catastrophes or damages *irreparables in monuments of the cultural heritage European -among the *cuales also there are churches and monasteries #christian (#orthodox).-#If they show that data are correct: to)How thinks to take so that it do not continue this loss *irremediable, *yb)how thinks to take to restore- in measure of it possible- damages?Obviously, this question refers, in concrete, to a «cultural crime of war» that takes place in *Europa, in *Yugoslavia, in #where it also takes place a «environmental crime of war».
The withdrawal of the directive on cars of the meeting of the Council of Ministers by dictated of Chancellor is fact never seen and *inaudito, as neither has precedents in the recent history of the European Union decision to prevent by dictated the participation of Economy Minister #german in the meeting of the Council of Ministers that celebrated in *Finlandia.
Aspire to that of way in that today it takes it Parliament, the Council direct from *Tampere an audible message to the #european citizens, the message that the European Union really interests and works by his more vital interests: the *reforzamiento of the inner security, the free circulation, the free access to justice, the fight against the international organised delinquency, control of borders, respect of the rights and fundamental freedoms.

Have seen that the Court of Justice has ratified faculty of States members to take decisions in this matter and besides, regarding point that *usted has underlined relative to distribution inside the territory of State, have to add that norms in matter of competition and the principle of no discrimination do not force to States members to take in account looks of regional character to hour to award licences for casinos neither permissions to organise games of chance.

With #everything, although we consider the proposal of common resolution too much bent to hypothesis of missile aerial more that to the of artefact planted in the interior and, especially, although we consider the own proposal too much indulgent and diplomatic with the #italian political authorities, share the need to ask at last cooperation of #all States members of the European Union so that they facilitate it that went *menester for a timely and suitable deepening of investigations, so as to that #can discover the *ejecutores, the *inductores and reasons of this absurd slaughtering.
Gentleman President, in my own name and in the of members of Parliament, although respecting fully the solemn character of the session of today, wanted to signal a question of relative order to article 19 of the Regulation, based in worry by the human rights, since the visit of today of President of *Colombia limits to address in front of Parliament until the official dinner with the bosses of the political groups.
*Tampere has shown that the Union has the political intention to trace common politics in questions that are intimately tied to the daily life, as it is to reinforce security feeling of citizens by means of the fight against crime organised, especially in drugs, in money wash and in the traffic of human beings, with the judicial cooperation and the mutual recognition of the decisions.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0029\/1999) of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market concerning the common position (6884\/171999 - *C5-0029\/1999 - 1998\/0163(*COD)) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to the velocimeters of engine vehicles of two or three tyres and by the that amends the Directive 92\/61\/*CEE of the relative Council to the reception of engine vehicles of two or three tyres (Speaker: Mr. *Ferri)
Is necessary to highlight likewise the need that the Union subject interventions in this matter to a more rigid control and establish systems of review so much of the implication and of information to the #sindical representatives of workers, as of the effective goodness no only economic, but also social of said interventions, had account that no always helps of the Union to companies have had like answer the stable development of activities of #the same and the *salvaguardia of employment taxes.
*Yo believe that it pertinent, taking into account, besides, that the report of the Court of Accounts produces a series of consequences on the own parliamentary activity -and think particularly in the approval of the management-, it that we have to take, is *plantearle to President of the Court of Accounts it that has occurred, reach that it engage publicly, apart from presenting excuses #if *ello was pertinent, to investigation to be able to control this subject, that improve distribution system and information to Parliament, but, in any case, understand that, at the end, it that go to take is *sancionarnos to *nosotros same through this behaviour.
Therefore, is our duty, in century end, *preguntarnos on boy millions that are subjected to prostitution, that *suicidan, that drug and, in moments in that our continent hardly #if it begins to discover the *estragos of the *pedofilia, in front of the that during *muchísimo time have closed the eyes, owe *preguntarnos #which is the cause that, in our democratic countries and economically developed, that #all the years celebrate with pride a new anniversary of the Statement of the the Rights of Man, these same rights see *pisoteados until point *cuando refer to the feeblest, is to say, to boys.
In addition to the three points mentioned of Colony Statements, have arisen in different fields, among other questions, the Court of Justice of the *CE, the Court of Accounts, distribution of seats of Parliament, flexibility and division in two parts of creation Treaty of the *CEE. in our report will Present, in base conversations kept and to sight points received, our own visions on it that consider that it is possible and recommended.
To #that *respecto, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, *permítaseme present an example: #if in the Council had a modification in the weighting of the votes, in the that, in fact, the countries with more population and the greater countries had more can, and enlargement of the qualified majority to the process of *codecisión took that tendency stressed also in the European Parliament, ask: #which will be paper in this *Europa of the small countries or of the poor countries of the European Union?
. (IN) In the weeks that have preceded to the agreement on this resolution, deputies of the European Parliament have procured to achieve that attitude of the Union *propicie really a "Round of Development" in the *OMC, that the countries in development have the possibility to be associated of plenary right in the negotiation process, and stand out that the benefits of trade have to centre in the fight against the *agravación of poverty in our world.
With the argument of enlargement -#whose materialisation no *nos poses problems of principle, but no *nos seems that it #can carry out without measuring the consequences, in diverse levels- and in name of efficiency and democracy, pretends a modification of the Treaties in particular in the institutional sphere: abandonment of unanimity and enlargement to new spheres of the decisions by qualified majority, new weighting of the votes in the decisions of the Council by qualified majority and modification of the composition and of the operation of the institutions (number of Commissioners, Presidency of the Council, composition of the *PE or even consecration of work tongues...)
industry, States Members and the Commission have to collect #all the necessary information to prepare and present complaint on the regulation of the commercial tariffs and evaluate the suitability to resort to action of the *OMC, the Commission has to continue supervision efforts of the market in cooperation with industry and, finally, #all parts involved have to encourage for establishing a field of action for the sector.
By reason, *yo believe that the Conference *Intergubernamental occupies a central place inside the triangle formed by enlargement, the Conference *Intergubernamental and the external politics and of security. In this context, also has to remain absolutely clear that in moment, already was with 12 or with 13 candidates to adhesion, #can admit deviation of the criteria of *Copenhague, and this Assembly do not goes to allow that it produce and do not goes to ratify any treaty in this sense.
Especially, also has reached an agreement -Parliament also conceded importance to look, *justificadamente to my seem- that it answers to #one *constatación political important, to know, that the tasks of the European Union in *Kosovo and in the region of the *Balcanes are tasks of varied years and that fulfillment in the financial look #can require an increase of costs in the field of the external politics regarding the planned at the beginning of this year, on the base of a distinct political situation.
In the first place, the European Parliament; of course, the no governmental organisations, and in point, and since it has posed the question, want to say that movement of woman and the no governmental organisations have exerted and exert paper *excepcionalmente important and have been really strengths *motrices of politics that have gone configuring in the #european field; and, of course, will take part also the Commission, with #many of services, states members, and the Presidency.
Challenge to minister #scottish of Agriculture to that it evade *Londres and support the request of the Scottish Nationalist Party, that delivered yesterday to the #french Government, in the sense that the #french authorities study thoroughly and with character of urgency the scientific proofs, the capacity to determine origin and the situation of labeling in *Escocia; and take a call to #all colleagues #french of this Assembly so that they defend line in front of Government.
An important part of the enlargement process of the European Union are the different programs of existent cooperation among the Union and the aspiring countries to adhesion, and game point is precisely the improvement of the economy of these countries of face to create possibilities of employment in his own territories, so that inhabitants do not see forced to emigrate by economic reasons.
Like solution offers the #french rule, the *cual, as I complement of the national diet of fixed price, contains likewise disposals relative to import, export and *reimportación, is compatible with the Right of the European Union and has shown efficiency in practice. Thus, gentleman Commissioner, the European Parliament, above division in political Groups, as it will be able to check easily, expects the green light for rule of character legal or contractual in *Alemania and *Austria to put good end once and for all to this interminable history.
Believe that #if there #be a reasonable solution from a point of economic sight, with the that publishers agree; #if there #be a solution that takes into account the diverse linguistic fields and cultural; #if there #be a solution that neither comport the greatest restriction of competition in application of the prohibition of *sopesar contained in article 85, then are in the correct path to give with a suitable rule.
Is the question of #if the Commission engages to fulfil with the promise of services for politics in matter of competition of Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, in the sense that before it accept definitively the general diet of exemption by category and before they fix definitively orientations, the present Commission proposals to Parliament and that still have the opportunity to elaborate a report on *ellas.
(OF ) Gentleman President, as I no longer am the youngest of the 626 deputies, as *me occurred in October of 1965 *cuando was member for the first time of Parliament, is natural that the report on the new perspectives of life of age persons in the century *XXI *me interest especially, also in quality of representative of a national organisation and a big #european organisation of women #where, by true, the most ancient members are the most active, without #whose work from charges *honoríficos these organisations -like #a lot of #others also- #can not *subsistir, because youngsters are so overloaded of familiar and labour obligations that hardly are for activities *honoríficas.
The speakers, with #all reason, have not forgotten the cultural looks, especially in section 28, in the that it insists in the need to promote the image of the greater persons in society and, in this sense, have to say that rather we have retreated regarding the ancient societies, especially the #Grecia classical, to the that we have to it essential of civilisation and that, with reason, valued experience cumulus and wisdom that represented the elderly. to this *respecto, *nos confront to an authentic ideology of *desvalorización of the past.
immunity, therefore, is a question of public order and in the case that *me occupies, the of Mr. *Moniz, Mr. *Moniz in moment determined asked that *le raised the parliamentary immunity, *algo that has been taken into account in the resolution of Regulation Commission, that by unanimity voted the suspension of immunity, but no by reason of the will of Mr. *Moniz to appear in front of the Administration of Justice, but because they fulfilled the requirements.
Fortunately, president of #ECB *Duisenberg put of self-evident Monday of the past week in the last session of Parliament that descent of interest types of 8 April was precisely an attempt to contribute *algo to the economic reflation of the Union, said of mood, has recognised *textualmente that the monetary politics also has an economic function.
#If they do not modify relations that there #be in this moment among the countries and the regions of greater economic development and countries and regions in the that this economic development is lower, #can *encontrarnos with #one *Europa economic and social of two speeds, because the countries and the regions that have a greater economic development, like Professor *Prodi knows very well, have tendency to consolidate his economic evolution and, instead, #that #others that are in a situation of worse economic development #can perpetuate in inferiority situation.
The main disposals of this directive include it following: consumer will have of a period of 14 days before celebrating agreement that *le will give time to compare diverse proposals and study agreement in detail before giving his final agreement; consumer will have of a period of 14 days of right of retractation, 30 days for credits *hipotecarios, life insurances and the operations of individual retirement to renounce to agreement without penalties neither obligation of justification.
In measure in that it #can consider the possibility to hire to the current collaborators of the secretariat of *Schengen in the institutions of the EU, disposals of article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen do not prevent of mood #any that the Council hire to the possible interested applying norms established in the Statute of civil servants or resorting to the procedure of alternative contracting foreseen in article 24 of fusion «Treaty».
Subject: Support to a new program *LEADER *III #Can *esbozar the Council his current plans with regard to development of a rural politics fully integrated to scale of the EU, and #can guarantee that part of this political will be support continued to the new program *LEADER *III and the maintenance of denomination, that has been synonymous of endowment of management instruments and help and of a positive image for the European Union?
Wanted to warn to the Council that, in spite of progresses that has carried out in matter of transparency, #if work group continues showing so *restrictivo in front of intervention right by part of Parliament, no will have agreement and will follow, legislative procedure after legislative procedure, blocking measures of *comitología and *oponiéndonos to the approval of measures *restrictivas of this type, at the same time that will follow *mostrándonos very *restrictivos in the votes on the budgets and credits that will take possible in the future the meetings of character committees *comitológico.
To hour to confront this challenge, without embargo, *nos find in front of a paradox: the European Union will be in first line to hour to offer contribution; nevertheless, the impact of help #can dispel in a complex network of structures that compete among himself\/hisself: the Mission of Nations Joined for *Kosovo, the Stability Pact, the Group of the Seven of big importance for the economic coordination, the Office of the High Representative for *Bosnia, the Sent Special for the Republic of *Yugoslavia, #etcetera.
Is confidence *mermada: *mermada as it shows it the fact that it is increasingly under number of the that choose to the European Parliament; and *mermada, to our understand, no only by events that caused the resignation of the previous Commission, but also, and *yo #would say especially, by the fact that the #european citizens often see in the Commission source of *imposiciones bureaucratic, sometimes costly, sometimes no indispensable and neither urgent, sometimes obtuse and even hurtful, *imposiciones that at all have to see with construction process of a *Europa joined and that, by misfortune, in occasions prejudice the ideal Europeans.
More even, although the poured direct of industrial materials, included the military deposit of residual ammunitions, is practice that has been amply abandoned by States members, the locations of these poured follow constituting a real threat for resources *pesqueros and, in #some occasions, for example, no very far of my own coast, *Beaufort *Dyke, a threat for the human security and, often, lives of fishermen are in danger, to the equal that are it health and the welfare of persons that visit the coast or well live there.
Finally, believe that it has got moment that they adopt the proposals to the *respecto presented by #Grecia, among the that include the materialisation of the "fast access of citizen to justice" by means of resource to alternative procedures, like mediation and action *conciliatoria before trial, #as well as the creation of a system harmonised of public order and of resolution of differences, based in the principles of freedom and democracy, and in respect of the fundamental freedoms and right state.
The answer of Commissioner *Nielson went of it more wanders, and *me surprises to check that today the European Parliament have been able to give green light to the signature of this agreement of *librecambio, *cuando even the principle of the protection of denominations of origin is not clearly recognised in the annex of the agreement neither establishes guarantee #any regarding the evolution of type imports #zero and to consequences on the group of the sector *vitivinícola #european.
Postpone the approval of this agreement *interinstitucional or, it that it #would be still worse, not to approve it, and, therefore not being able to apply it in our internal field, #would plant in a very embarrassing situation to the European Parliament, a situation that #would lessen the fine work that Parliament has made with regard to reestablishing the credibility of the European Union in the questions referents to fraud and to the bad financial management.
Regarding the #others lines of the relative budget to the external actions of category 4 of the financial perspectives, a reduction of the fixed amount of assignments attributed goes to avert, to time, that adopt decisions precipitated on rectification of the maximum limits of category, because, as I already have said, the evaluation of the real needs of reconstruction has not concluded still.
Without damage of the positive results that to a large extent finishes to underline President in exercise of the Council, #can not leave to recognise that in #some points the Commission expresses disappointment. The Commission regrets that the European Council did not adopt the concept of only system of asylum, that corresponds, to our understand, to an ambition, but also to the need *imperiosa to tackle asylum questions of collective and coherent form.
Want to report also activation attempt of games allocated to *Turquía, in the frame of the union *aduanera and of impulse to relations *euroturcas; parallel attempt to the presentation of proposals for the approval of the corresponding juridical base necessary, *cuando is known that the situation of the human rights has not improved in *Turquía, that keeps politics regarding the question *kurda, that keeps occupation of a big sector of *Chipre.
In the report asks also to the Commission that support integration process of these environmental goals in the energetic politics by means of investigations on the repercussions of the climatic change and on #all the possible technologies, by means of investigations to determine the best indicators with seen to calibrate attainments in the reduction of broadcasts and by means of the presentation of periodic reports to Parliament.
This proposal constitutes the first, and only the first, of measures, because it offers uniform norms on competition of the courts of States members in matter of divorce and separation, #as well as in matter of relative processes to the regulation of the parental responsibility, and offers also a clear and coherent frame for a fast recognition and practically automatic in each #one of States members of the decisions adopted in another Been member in the field of the application of the regulation.
To the *respecto, the bilateral agreement that States Joined have signed with Chinese to prepare entry of this last in the World-wide Organisation of Trade, has to consider by the European Union, apart from an important contribution to the process *multilateral, also and especially a fundamental moment to check the substantial weight that the human rights have and will have in front of the opportunities that offers a market that enjoys of enormous potentialities like the Chinese.
Are *precipitándonos in road without exit when despising the prerogatives of deputies, when despising history of parliamentarism of the European Union and of #all States members and, as we do not want to correct error that committed six months ago, are had to institutionalise delation in Parliament, to allow that assistant or civil servant of Parliament take complaint, because it suspect that premium of the coined of *Fulano or *Mengano have committed maybe fraud!
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0063\/1999) of Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on the communication of the Commission to the Council, to the European Parliament, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions on an action plan of the European Union in matter of fight against drug (2000-2004) (*COM(1999) 239 - *C5-0093\/1999 - 1999\/2095(*COS))
The Commission prefers, as, that manager call Mr. *Brittan or Mr. *Lamy, *mermar by anticipated our positions on the principle of caution, the sanitary security and the protection of the environment, #as well as the economic interests of the rural zones, and, in the frame of banana, loan *poca attention to the traditional and privileged relations that countries keep, in the frame of international commitments, with the countries *ACP.
For *nosotros, the introduction, in the resolution, of a specific reference to the principle of sovereignty of States #would have involved the risk to put in *entredicho attainments of the system of Nations Joined and, specifically, of the world-wide Conference of 1993, that had that "the promotion and the protection of #all the human rights is a legitimate worry of the international community".
Without embargo, have to think once again, *Señorías, that the report foresees that, #if we adopt the text, the financial cooperation #can suspend in case of rape of the democratic principles of Right State, of the human rights or of the fundamental freedoms No means #this that #if today we concede the financial advantages, slat in matter of human rights, #etcetera, already has fixed and that, in consequence, only shrinking concerning the current situation #can give place to the suspension?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, although the two regulations that today debate do not have, in reality, relation with the debate that will take place next Monday in the Council of General Subjects and days afterwards in the European Council of *Helsinki, *yo comprise, of course, that #can not dispense of the political and temporary context and that, obviously, are forced to consider also, together with said regulations, the general problem of relation of the European Union with *Turquía and vice versa, #such as they already have taken the majority of orators this afternoon.
Regarding the amendment 9 on the content of the annual report, the speaker wants to add article to clear the content of this report that, among things, will have to comprise an analysis of the influence of actions of manufacturers and of factors related with the strategy for tourisms and carbon dioxide in the eventual changes that produce in dioxide broadcasts of carbon.
Only #can confirm that it is a positive answer to the challenge of the will of States members to struggle against fraud, to put order in his own house, to improve control systems, a challenge that, as we signal in the annual report, #can that this year it was still greater, although neither by moment diminishes paper and responsibility of the Commission in this context.
Without embargo, already has of a very precise study of the World-wide Bank and the relative Commission to reconstruction of *Kosovo, of the *cual gives off clearly that the resource total financial pertinent of the external help required will be of 2.300 millions of dollars, or of euros, during the next years, since in addition to damages caused by war, exist damages accumulated because of the disastrous repercussions of the political situation of the last years for persons of *Kosovo.
Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and States members, by part, and the Republic of *Hungría, by #another, to take into account adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of Realm of *Suecia to the European Union (9725\/1999 - *C5-0190\/1999 - 1997\/0272(*AVC)) (Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence)

Also give the thanks to the Commission, included Commissioners that today are presents, for signalling untiringly dynamics fault, change need, especially with regard to paper of the governments and of Parliament, in the taking of measures that relieve the fiscal pressure, that stabilise the public finances and that improve the operation of the labour market and of education in States members.
And was that, really, #few parliamentary will have had fortune and the honour to begin his parliamentary career -that besides coincided with première in a political forum institutionalised- with the directive on suffrage in the municipal elections of citizens of the resident Union in a Been member of the that are not national, and *terminarla with this report on the consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam in relation with the legislative proposals in course.
The European Union confronts with great challenges: transposition of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, negotiations for enlargement, enlargement of the zone euro, negotiation round of the *OMC, the improvement of the common politics in the field of justice and interior subjects, and especially the strengthening of paper in the field of the external relations.
Remember that transparency bases in the definition of responsibilities and assume commitment of *emplearme in depth in this field that was #one of the decisive problems of the last crisis: transparency among the collective political responsibility of the Commission, but also individual of the responsible Commissioners of wallets, #as well as of management, and the big administrative responsibility that, by the contrary, corresponds to the structure of the Directions.
In the amendment 3, asked to the General Secretary that provide to the Commission of Budgetary Control a report on reasons and the circumstances that have carried to the decision of *escindir to the General Direction of the budget, of personnel and of finances, on the effects of said decision, on efficiency of the management of the budget and the politics of personnel.
Together with speaker, *nos cheer of advances registered in implantation of the new budgetary tools and accountants that will guarantee a greater transparency in breast of the Foundation of *Dublín, #as well as of the signature of cooperation agreement among #this and the European Agency for Security and Health in Work of *Bilbao, with seen to avert the *despilfarros and the useless repetitions, to time that develop #all the possible synergies.
Finally, although it was not it less important, trying prepare the improvement of the economic and political relations of the EU with #all the countries of the *Balcanes Western by means of agreements of stabilisation and association, like element and *pilar important of the stability pact that it has talked the Presidency, with seen to the achievement of security, democracy and the economic development and, to time, the supplementary perspective of adhesion to the #european and #euro-atlantic structures.
For quoting an example, lady Commissioner, a same problem -the *despoblación- tackles in Diary 2000 of three distinct forms: by part, the #nordic zones *despobladas access to the Goal 1, is to say, to the main structural Bottoms; on the other hand, the *Highlands #scottish obtain only a special bottom to mood of compensation; and finally third - form to tackle the problem of population density-, other territories -as it is the case of *Aragón- that suffer problem remain *marginados of helps.
In the 55ª Conference of the Commission of Human Rights of the UN celebrated of the 22 to 30 April of this year in Gin, the European Union has taken the initiative of a resolution on the situation of the human rights in the *Iraq that, among things, appeals to the direction *iraquí to continue cooperation in the application of the program «oil by foods» and to a just distribution of the humanitarian imports.
The increase of competitiveness among the regions #can not leave to take into account the danger of disequilibriums created by level differences of employment and of the human resources, the quality of infrastructures, the natural environment and development, especially in this so delicate stage that has opened from the determination of the regions that #can admit in the Goal 2.
is not moment of *analizarlas in detail, but want to underline that the relative problems to assignment of the budgetary resources, to the protection of the financial interests of the Union, to the fight against fraud, to the management of agreements or to decentralisation constitute subjects that involve solutions and answers that need of the active cooperation of the European Parliament and also, and especially, of States members gathered in the Council of Ministers.
Want to call attention on questions like the following: #if it takes seriously the right of self-determination of villages, #this involves also that they have to take seriously the constitutional parliaments of States members, of the regions, of the cultural communities, and that will occupy place in the *Europa subsidiary of the future, because the right of self-determination is a holy principle for #all villages of the world and *eso no comports exclusively to States, since the concepts no always coincide.
To which it is necessary to add other 45 millions of euros that will disburse during the next three years in the frame of a special budgetary line devoted to the countries in development of the different regions of the world, to the equal that 20 millions euros allocated to a regional program *quinquenal for the countries *ACP and other additional bottoms in program frame *indicativos, directed #among others to the countries *ACP, without explaining besides, for example, the *cofinanciación of organisations no governmental or of investigation program.
But, as it has said very well Mr. *Patten, do not owe *subestimar difficulties that still threaten in horizon, that surely *nos will take to drop in critical situations - *ojalá *pasajeras - in the that #all had to have especially presents two considerations: in *primer term, that method to follow advancing has to be always a sincere dialogue, opened and direct among parts and, second, that, anyway, #israeli and Palestinians share an enemy -terrorism- expressed in #any one of forms, that do not has another goal that the destruction of peace, of freedom and of respect of the human rights.
A wanton mind #can, firstly, signal to the Commission that this sentence *nos removes illusions, since *nosotros thought -knows God #if we are not fed up to hear it- that it was to the European Union to the that *le owed, from 50 years ago, stability, the economic growth, the peaceful solution of the *litigios, #etcetera; but mind simply curious #can ask to the Commission it that thinks on purpose of the continuous decline, decade after decade, of the annual tax of half growth of the countries developed.
#If I listen to the Council, to the Commission and to Deputies of Parliament, seem rather to hedgehogs taking love; with fear to puncture and knowing that in #all the important subjects -and step to *enumerarlos once again-, the social looks commented still by Mr. *Hansenne, the sustainable development, culture, the preventive principle in feeding, the agricultural file, the countries in roads of development, the welfare of animals, seems that we are #all simply of agreement.
#Some examples: #would have to impose to companies term of six months of suspension of restructuring plan to allow a *peritaje #sindical independent; #if company has received public helps -already has said-, included Europeans, the *inobservancia of norms established #would have to comport return; in sense, in the directive on the committees of #european company, #would have to strengthen noticeably paper of said committees, #as well as the protection of delegates of personnel.
By it that refers, more precisely, to the nuclear question and of my colleague Mr. *Lamy, His *Señorías know -to *ello has referred Mrs. *Maes- that Mr. *Lamy has sent a letter to president of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, Mr. *Westendorp, today same, in the that takes balance of the situation and says very clearly -and with #this answer also to Mrs. *Maes- that still is missing the official confirmation by part of *Rusia for the signature of the decision of 12 December 1994.
Like member of the academic profession, *me bothers a lot that it go back to pose the question of the readers of foreign tongues in universities #italian without that it have had a resolution to cape of eleven years, after they have dictated three sentences in favour of the rights of these common citizens and currents that try to exert the free circulation and enjoy of the fundamental principle of the Union and of the Inner Market of no discrimination by reasons of nationality.
Is truth that no only in the national level, but also in the community, the main action that #can carry out is complaint action, of #alert, of information, that has to run to charge of the no governmental organisations; on our part, the goal to the that *nos have devoted is sensitisation of the public authorities, of the police, to the that reports or do not reports, of judges that have to judge each concrete case, so that #all comprise the criminal scope of violence against women although it practise in family.
Believe that it is person that has shown in this moment, in #all this historical process, be the more able to take a complex evolution in the that has gone developing the #european identity of defence, in the that NATO and our North American partners go accepting the need of a *pilar strong European no only in the military terrain, but also in the industrial dimension that has to support it, and also stabilisation paper and consolidation of democracy in *Europa and in the Mediterranean.
In reality, uses with an excessive *discrecionalidad owed, with frequency, to political or economic interests particular: this principle of interference that to date has shown his fatal failure because diet of *Milosevic is still strongly anchored in power in a country that has stepped backwards in history and in the economy of at least thirty years, while the greater part of village #albanian has returned to territories, the 10% of the #serbian #kosovar and the whole of the populations of *etnia #gipsy are convicts to exile.
In the last years has come loaning attention to the fact that the neighbouring countries of the European Union, or was, the countries associated of *Europa Central and of the East or the countries integrated in the European Association of Free Trade and the that belong to the Economic Space European take part in #all the important activities of the European Community related with the use of sources of renewable energy and with development of the energetic performance.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, the Council has communicated in different occasions to the authorities of *Myanmar worry by the situation of the country, and the last time took in the session celebrated the 11 and on 12 October, in the that the Council *prorrogó by six months posture conjoint in front of *Myanmar and went back to urge to the Government of *Myanmar to that it begin quickly to apply concrete measures to boost respect of the human rights, democracy and the national reconciliation.

After having said that the economic politics European has like goal employment, after decreeing it and declaim it high and strong, without verifying in any moment of way realistic and pragmatic it justified of affirmation, records in the marble of the treaties subordination relation among it economic and it social, that finishes reducing #this last to a management of competition of #all and of each #one by work place in a labour market increasingly reduced.
Regarding the possibility of a horizontal communication of the Commission, believe that thanks to *ella will be able to focus his organisational effects, alluded in the suggestions of His *Señorías: the creation of unit in the Commission and budget assignment allocated to the protection of boys to improve the public control on the participation of the Union like #such in protection politics to boy.
pretence is to achieve backrest first to the proposal that go to pose -so much to the Commission as, in moment, #if the Commission the takes #his, to the Council of Ministers and to Parliament- precisely for no only follow forward in the incorporation of the Commission to *Eurocontrol, but also advance in it that it is the field of the fifteen countries to treat to achieve space only and, therefore, a common management of space only of the fifteen countries.
*Eso supposes that Mr. #Solana no only will have to occupy of the most immediate dimension of crisis prevention, but also -and #any experience has in *ello- of paper in relation with the world, is to say, with Nations Joined, with the Round of #Millenium, with the future of #FMI and of the *FAO; also is important in measure in that Europeans, building the Union, also are *algo important for the future of humanity and for stability.
In this way has reinforced even more, #if it fits, the guarantee that already appeared in parts of the text, of the full respect of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities -of the *cual want to mention especially article 10 that it is very precise and exhaustive- #as well as of the relative planned norms in article 6 of the Regulation that, in application of orientations of the Protocol, in article that finish to mention, regulates with more precision, #if it fits, immunities of deputies.

Sure enough, have considered that #some of the numerous amendments presented by the countries to the *cuales our position poses problems are, in our opinion, unacceptable, especially the #tending amendment to incorporate in this resolution a reference to section 7 of article 2 of the Letter of Nations Joined, in virtue of the *cual "disposal of the present Letter authorises to Nations Joined to take part in the subjects that are essentially of the national competition of State".
Want to, without embargo, call attention on the fact that it #would be timely that #all costs, #all men, #all means employed in the past to watch the internal borders of the European Union - for example, among #Italia and *Francia, *Francia and *Alemania, #etcetera, or was, among the #european States that now have a common border - employed in the external borders of the European Union, so as to combat better delinquency phenomenon and of illegal immigration.
Therefore, my invitation goes directed to #all #that that believe in #this dip, in these goals - and here have in front of *nosotros to President *Prodi that has declared it in reiterated occasions and that know that it believes in *ello - an invitation to be decided, determined; an invitation to the European Parliament so that, immediately after finalising the Summit of *Helsinki - #if, as I fear, the conclusion will be advance, but too much limited - gather and with big opening, with big value assume #all determinations saying in this moment and thinking, as in moments of the #european history, that Parliament has in front of himself\/hisself a big opportunity and a big task.

Even the *anunciadísima total suppression of the rights of customs in products of the no developed countries goes to accelerate the *usurpación of wealth of these countries, whereas, on the other hand, will flood the market with cheap articles that will displace the corresponding articles of countries like the #mine. The World-wide Organisation of Trade has not created to protect the interests, neither the of villages neither the of workers.
The Commission will go by road that Parliament recommended already takes time, that Mr. *Karlsson finishes also to show and that *yo same signalled also in August in my answers by writing to the parliamentary questions, in concrete, trip to the administration of functions of financial control that they are competent for programs of cost, is to say, decentralisation and with *ello, to time, increase of the financial responsibility in the administrative services that make costs.
Support absolutely this systematic *follow *up and, in consequence, celebrate to a large extent that the Commission in the frame of reform package for the financial management have decided to give to this systematic *follw *up a fixed structure so that in the future was possible to take advantage of of real way for the improvement of the financial management precisions of the Court of Accounts. For this wide project of reforms ask support of the European Parliament.
Also wanted to appeal to #that that have the possibility to benefit of program #Socrates, that #can take advantage of training possibilities, that go to be able to follow forming in the future, so that they contribute to that *Europa grow jointly, so that in the course of training recognise that we #can not, with our vertiginous rhythm that presents at present in development of #all programs, is to say, that to #all #that that #can not advance so fast *les take of hand, since the quality, level and training also demand that we do not give sideways to the feeblest.
Consider that an important opportunity to examine the concrete contribution of the Union to the creation of new places of work in *Europa the will provide the next summit of *Lisboa in March, that will be moment and place to take an evaluation of the three processes that finish to mention -Colony, *Luxemburgo and *Cardiff-, by part, and, by #another, to formulate the strategy, the synthesis of politics *macroeconómicas, innovation *microeconómica business and the imperative of the new society of information.

Gentleman President, on order question: although tonight no *nos accompanies the representative of the Council, *permítaseme ask #if the Commission or representative of the secretariat of Parliament know the reports of press agency that have seen, according to the *cuales yesterday adopted in the Council the decision of *prorrogar the voluntary plan during 12 months, with it that overlooked the procedure of *codecisión and this debate and the morning vote result irrelevant.
Gentleman President, the most palpable character, in our opinion, of the European Council that finishes to celebrate in *Helsinki is the absence of vision political on a long-term basis of State bosses and of government, that have decided enlargement of an unpublished importance with the possible addition of thirteen new members, without giving in moment the conceptual tools that allowed to imagine the able institutional structures of *asumirla.
By #this ask to Parliament, to the Council, to the Commission and to Nations Joined that they do not recognise diet of the Talibans and that promote an action plan in favour of the no governmental organisations that operate in *Afganistán after the fundamental freedoms of women #afghan and his economic and social emancipation and in favour of the no governmental organisations that help to women #afghan refugees.
Gentleman President, as it has announced, substitute to Mrs. *Aglietta that this afternoon #can not be here, and it first that I want to take before presenting my report on the *comitología, is to express my gratitude to Mrs. *Adelaide *Aglietta and recognise seriousness and the importance of work, a competent work, subtle, acute and effective; work that, of course, has had support of #all the secretariat of the Commission of Institutional Subjects, in particular of Mrs. *Patrizia *Prode, #as well as with the continuous help of Mrs. #Monica *Frassoni.
But although they #can not take schematic analyses, *yo #can not *obviar in this context comment: the Common Agricultural Politics and the World-wide Organisation of Trade are increasingly research of competitiveness exacerbated like fundamental element, thing that *me seems absolutely worrisome because this type of *sacralización of competitiveness above #everything it other surely conducts to practices of risk, like the utilisation of hormones or antibiotics, for example, among the matters prevail for the animal feeding.
Like immediate measure, control of the organisations of technical assistance is of form more rigorous and specific, and the radical reform will ensure the meridian definition of the core of the functions of public service of civil servants of the Commission and the effective supervision and the responsible management of the executive agencies.
In this frame, have to express the enormous worry that feels my Group in front of the debate that will celebrate in *Tampere on the police cooperation, the fight against drugs, data protection, the democratic control of *Europol and Information System of *Schengen. Fear once again that participants will not give size in these important points that have a deep impact on democracy in *Europa.
No treats only to ensure, in the frame of globalisation of the economy, growth able to create durable and sustainable employment, or to propose an institutional reform in depth of face to the next Conference *Intergubernamental; neither treats only to carry forward the subject of enlargement of the Union to contribute, like this, to the welfare of the *Europa global, in spite of the importance *innegable of these challenges.
The European Council in Colony examined the capacity of *Europa to carry out functions established in article 17 of the Treaty of the Union, calls of *Petersberg, functions related with the humanitarian help and with rescue measures and pacification, #as well as with the definition of the mission of fight groups in control of the crisis, included pacification, time that *Europa have solvent military means.
Among #others, suffering and the death of productive members of societies and -thing very important- the *apartamiento of women of employment to devote to loan cares and resource deviation of families and the communities to devote savings to pay attention costs of health and, in fact, as it has to know, sure, *usted, the incessant burials that see in countries like *Zimbabwe, #if *te remain stopped in corner of a street.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner *Lamy, gentleman Minister *Sasi, the Round of #Millenium will have to promote necessarily forms of cooperation and integration among the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the International Organisation of Work, the International Monetary Bottom and the World-wide Bank, so as to that liberalisation of the commercial exchanges go accompanied of a renewed stability of the monetary market, of politics of full employment of the human resources, of networks of social protection and of respect generalised of the fundamental labour norms.
Lady Speaker, have written words beautiful after the celebrated summit in *Tampere; nevertheless, the fundamental premise so that these beautiful words convert in reality, is to say, so that they fulfil the principles humanists, is of course that persons #can go in in Strong *Europa, that begin of serious form to put in practice politics in the that it was possible to separate asylum politics of immigration, that begin to put in practice a serious politics of collaboration with the *ACNUR to end to solve the problems of refugees of *Europa and of the world.
On the question of the fundamental rights, the creation of the frame that allow to Parliament take contribution to the preparation of a letter is element, but go to celebrate debates on bottom, as, for *nosotros, this letter has to have direct effects, is to say, that citizens have to can *invocarla to appeal to the Court of Justice and this letter has to *versar on new rights for Europeans of the century *XXI.
Expect then, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, that the European Commission obtain a mandate of institution regarding development of these rights of citizens of third countries, and that #this develop in the widest sense, according to respect of the principle of no discrimination, also *cuando treat of the right of vote, the right to live in family and the right to the free circulation of persons, even *cuando the Summit has not manifested on *ello.
(*IT) The fact that the Commission have exhausted the last term to ask fixation of a date for negotiation is, definitely, regrettable, especially to sight of the global course of #all the question that already in the previous years saw to arise conflict in the institutional frame of query with reference to paper of Parliament in an agreement that has important budgetary repercussions.
In particular, consensus fault on the content of politics *macroeconómicas in the previous period to the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Maastricht and of the first orientations of economic politics played a fundamental paper in amplification of the negative effects, of the external crashes and in the development of greater obstacles to growth and to employment.
But today, remembering *algo that said here in the last Plenary -with *Tampere launches the signal to the #european citizens that *Europa has left to be only a market-, to me *me #would enjoy to say #alto and clear that, with this strategic document on the inner market that *nos has presented to Parliament and that it is today object of intervention, citizen goes to have a clear idea of coherence of this market and that this market has like last and main protagonist *él same.
The participation of the European Parliament *nos seems fundamental, no only because in the #european construction the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission constitute the three points of the triangle that have to conform a construction balanced, but also because the popular representatives gathered in Parliament are the most indicated to transmit the opinion of citizens that, after all, is it that matters, so that the Commission #can take out the timely conclusions.
In #one misses approach *macroeconómico, in #another is missing the realisation of structural reforms, in the third, there #be not an adjust among the economic politics and employment politics. Is evident that have increased the preventive measures as, for example, the insertion of the unemployed of long length in work market, or active measures as, for example, stimuluses to work research and to the creation of places of work.
Goes the Commission to adopt in negotiation time, in the possible decisions of commitment, the necessary measures so that it apply it that *usted has announced during audiences in nomination, is to say, test and labeling for meat of *vacuno, that by it other goes to be compulsory already from the 1-1-2000, #if we do not get to regulation in relation with the suspension of import prohibition and his *imposición in front of the countries that have agreed import prohibitions?
Subject: Law *HelmsBurton Has had knowledge the Commission of demonstrations taken by State Secretary of States Joined, Mrs. *Albright, relative to the impossibility by part of Congress of the #EE.UU. to modify the title *IV of the Law *Helms-*Burton, breaking like this #one of the essential elements of the Agreement among the European Commission and the Administration #Clinton, in the new frame of the Transatlantic Summit among #EE.UU. and the European Union of May of 1998?
Gentleman President, ask the word to remember once again that, from the principle of the term of office, the radical deputies do not take part in the votes neither Plenary neither in the commissions. And #this to call attention of the Presidency and of his *Señorías on the fact that to part of deputies *le denies the possibility to contribute with rights and means, to the parliamentary life.
Subject: Restrictions to navigation freedom imposed by *Turquía The 27 May 1997, the #turkish authorities adopted a Decision registered with number 2646 and signed by State Secretary of Maritime Subjects, Mr. *Nazmi *Kumral, in virtue of the *cual forbids access to *Turquía of #all fuselages *mercantes with pavilion #cypriot or that belong to *armadores Cypriots or of nationalities, included the of States members of the European Union, *cuando place of origin or of destination was *algún port of the free zone of the Republic of *Chipre.
discussion that have had in the Commission of relative Constitutional Subjects to road so that any possible illegal activity was put in knowledge of the *OLAF, believe that *nos has carried to find the suitable road, because a political organ has to have filter that examine #if sure enough informations are or no founded and #if they attack or no against immunity or word inviolability that have deputies.
Of way will be able to have of financial assistance with charge to the community budget for the reception, integration and the voluntary return of refugees, persons displaced and asylum applicants and will have an important instrument that gives a human dimension to asylum politics of the Union, as #one of deputies finishes to ask takes moments.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, had wished that the debate and the vote of this report had not taken place necessarily today, because *nosotros -and #this want to say it to the principle of my intervention -, because of the circumstances that *nos have forced to modify the agenda, and because of the fact that vote hour has extended so much owing to the long length of the reports *Napolitano, *Leinen, *Dimitrakopoulos and *Schwaiger that the report of Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou will vote it tomorrow early.
In accordance with the philosophy that inspires the new diet of the regions *ultraperiféricas -that besides has confirmed the European Council of Colony asking to the Commission that before 31 December present measures for the regions *ultraperiféricas- in this moment the incorporation of these regions to the European Union do not happens necessarily by harmonisation *arancelaria and fiscal, but that allows treatment differentiated, for example the maintenance of the *octroi of *mer in the #french departments of *Ultramar and the of special diets in *Azores and *Madeira.
Another question that have to consider *cuando talk of the construction of new ships is the problem of waste and means to treat waste, and no only *me refer to waste that derive of the operation of ships but also to rubbish produced during trip, because pollution of the sea is an important fed up question and ships are in very fine responsible measure of *ella.
Coincide fully in assessment that it is absolutely necessary to reaffirm the international presence of the European Union in the international scene, especially in security looks and defence, for the that the Presidency #finnish -and it is necessary to say it with legitimate pride- has given a decisive impulse with this historical meeting of ministers of External Subjects and of ministers of Defence, that is the first time that produces in history of the European Union.
*Yo always repeat that *Turquía already #would have advanced more in approximation to *Europa #if it had adopted before, in the timely moment, other more radical measures in the field of the human rights, of the rights of minorities, especially regarding the problem *kurdo, and of democracy in the frame of relations with #Grecia, and had contributed to the solution of the problem of *Chipre.
With time, obviously, #any one that request it and fulfil with the requirements will find place in the political level; without embargo, #if today we do not proceed quickly in this sense and think in expanding bending almost number of States members without institutional reforms *meditadas and checked -no longer there #be time to experience- condemn to death to dream of #one *Europa political able to respect identities, cultures and traditions and to contribute, nevertheless, to create a new model of #european citizen.
Also have to value with caution the improvements ascertained by the Commission and the Presidency of the Council in the interior of *Turquía, #if have present ratification of death conviction of Mr. *Ocalan, that the awarded with Prize *Sajarov *Leyla *Zana continues imprisoned for having claimed right to freedom of opinion, solution fault to the problem *kurdo and all it that expresses in said document in relation with progresses of *Turquía.
#- - Proposal of decision of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of the Protocol for adaptation of the institutional looks of the European Agreement among the European Communities and States members, by part, and *Rumanía, by #another, to take into account adhesion of the Republic of *Austria, of the Republic of *Finlandia and of Realm of *Suecia to the European Union (9730\/1999 - *C5-0195\/1999 - 1997\/0277(*AVC)) (Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Security and Political of Defence)
Support that taxes of the heavy transports are taxed in accordance with his real level of pollution and that destination of these amounts devote to investments in the railway and to investments in transport combined among road and railway and, finally, aim the idea to deliver the 91% of permissions that do not distribute according to an equal quota among #all States members attending no only to the needs of transport in himself\/hisself same but also considering the origin and destination, for example, of commodities that cross Swiss pertinent of airports or ports like *Hamburgo, *Rotterdam, *Génova or *Marsella.

Gentleman President, for me the greater problem that presents the text that go to vote tomorrow -finish to collect it in distribution- resides in article 3 of the proposal of the Commission, according to the *cual #would forbid substances inside the European Union -pray to the Commission that *me listen, because I want to ask explanation-; as *eso, it that #would vote is that we forbid substances inside the European Union, but admit that prohibition do not affect to manufacture and commercialisation inside the European Union, since the #would send to another Been member with seen to export to third countries.
The Scientific Committee on Health and the Animal Welfare approved on 10 March 1999 report on looks of utilisation of *somatotropina bovine relative to the animal welfare and declared that the *BST increases the risk of *mastitis clinical and the length of treatment, increases the incidence of disorders in legs, #can affect negatively to reproduction and induce varied severe reactions in the zone of injection.
regretting that the Council have decided to accept to *Turquía like candidate to adhesion, expect that, at least, do not give new steps while Government have not adopted the necessary measures in the field of the human rights, of the international right regarding border delimitation, of the application of the resolutions of Nations Joined on *Chipre and of a political solution for the question *kurda;
Without embargo, it #would be necessary to abstain of excess of zeal putting in *entredicho a system that has worked well, especially #if this review of politics of competition on the vertical restrictions runs the risk to put in danger #all a sector that, thanks to exclusive agreements of distribution, in particular beer agreements, has worked well until the present, giving satisfaction to time to the *cerveceras, by part, and, by #another, to the sector of coffees, hotels and restaurants.
Gentleman President, #would wish to take part about an only question, of a subject of the greater importance for the European Parliament: *usted has engaged in the exert of activities like President of the Commission to undertake of way *convincente reforms that Parliament expects of the new Commission, by it that *cuando, got moment, carry out selection work together with the Governments of States members, will have to demand individually to each #one of the future members, #as well as to the group of the Commission, this same commitment of reform.
The participation of *Rusia means first of all that will renounce to exert the blockade in the Security Council, so that it was possible to adopt a resolution on the base of Chapter *VII, with an international juridical foundation clear, founded in a decision of the Security Council like title of the monopoly of the use of strength in the frame of the international political system.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0224\/99) by Mrs. *Kuhn, in name of the Delegation of the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee, on the conjoint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on determined looks of sale and the guarantees of consumption sakes (*C4-0042\/99 - *C4-0171\/99-96\/0161(*COD))
Quote *textualmente: «*Nos pleases the statement of the European Rabbit of *Berlín with regard to the peace process, in particular regarding the right of the Palestinians to self-determination without reservations, included the right to create State, with regard to the *cual the European Union is had to foresee recognition in moment, #as well as commitments assumed by the European Union regarding the future solution to conflict».

Gentleman President, *Señorías, *les appreciate very sincerely this debate that has been deep, clear and, in cases, exhaustive and that, in group, has put of self-evident a wide confidence in our future work: a wide confidence because #all orators, even the that have directed critical to the composition of the Commission, have recognised the need of a big and solid work in common, #as well as the fact that the future of the European Union assent in collaboration among Parliament and the Commission.
Yes, gentleman President, arms *callan, but mines *antipersonal continue taking *estragos. The horror of war has finished, but no the horror of the finding, day after day, of the common pits, tragic and heartbreaking testimony of contempt of the right to life of persons and of villages that *nos is more that respect to diversities, to identity of village by #whose affirmation will struggle in Plenary and struggle in our national Parliaments.
Although obviously I #can not force to my colleague Mrs. *Loyola of Palace, that in these moments is *felizmente deputy in Parliament, regarding politics and relations with this Assembly, do not is missing the one who considers that it has got hour that the Commission and Parliament deepen in negotiations on the procedures and the conventions of this Assembly that, as it is known, gathers in more of place, #as well as on the conventions and the procedures of School.
To sight of these circumstances, wanted to *recalcar once again that the problem of refugees no only has not resolved, but that converts day in more dramatic, as I have been able to check in my recent trips to the fields of #palestinian refugees in *Líbano, *Jordania and Syrian, #as well as in the distinct reports of the *OOPS and of Mr. *Menéndez of Valley, in quality of Representative of the humanitarian help of the European Union in *Jordania.
With #everything, want to say simply that congratulate to #all his *Señorías by interventions, because *algo has emerged with strength: further of rapidity with that it is necessary to carry out program, it important is that the European Union and the European Parliament exert a very active paper, very strong so that in Orient Half, and especially among Palestinian and #Israel, establish a stable and durable peace, so as to find a solution to the problem of refugees and so that a #palestinian State #can live peacefully with the #israeli State.
Exist two basic principles of the operation of the *OMC: by part, discrimination, impassable, among products #whose processes of production are different -*me refer to the environmental conditions or the social conditions in the *cuales elaborates product-; on the other hand, the fact that it is necessary to reduce to the minimum the negative effects on the *librecambio of measure political relative to the public health, to the protection of the environment or to the social protection.
But the Council, afterwards, opened the box of #Pandora introducing two purportedly technical amendments: #one, to article 3, in the that establishes legislation species delegated, with a continuous reference to the Regulation of the Economic Commission for *Europa of Nations Joined; and #another, to article 6, expanding entrance term in vigour of the directive because of the need of adaptation time of industry.
The Commission #can accept the spirit, on condition that they introduce modifications in #some cases to the text of the relative amendments to the complementary measures, the participation of the local communities in reconstruction, coordination with organisations no governmental, query to Parliament before the Agency extend activities to zones of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and, of course, to the budgetary transparency.
(Parliament approves the legislative resolution)- Report (To5-0037\/1999) of Mrs. *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the juridical subjects and the inner market (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219\/1999)
Although the decisions on the possibility by part of *Turquía to receive to programs in the frame of the current proposals do not allow an immediate effective participation of country, will allow to the European Union send a positive signal to the #turkish civil society and express once again will to develop the sectorial cooperation with *Turquía.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0040\/1999) of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer, on the common position of the Council [<lpar>$^5617<num>$/^2<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0037<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1998<num>$/^0272<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to information on fuel consumption facilitated to consumer when commercialising vehicles of new tourism (Speaker: Mr. *Sterckx).
*Yo am absolutely convinced that it was error -and want to signal it by time- that the ancient European Commission did not continue, *cuando initiated the previous legislative period, work on a right of #european obligations, that already had initiated Mr. *Lando and his commission, although this Assembly, that Parliament, already had put to disposal the corresponding resources.
did not has to be it to scale #european neither, obviously, neither to scale national, because *cuando exists the social dialogue - that in reality consists in dialogue among the great unions of workers, often of the most traditional sectors of the economy, and the big company - with frequency are dialogues, cooperations, *concertaciones that have like result exclude to the one who today remains to the *margen of the economic systems Europeans, is to say, the unemployed, immigrants, convicts to remain out of the system of the privileged, the that they find out of work system guaranteed.
Gentleman President, in proposal on the guidelines for employment politics of States members in the year 2000, the Commission splits of bottom consideration: progresses made by employment process, after the launching taken in the extraordinary Summit, are considerable; signals data - million #eight hundred one thousand places of work created in *Europa - and confirms, therefore, the structure based in four *pilares and the fundamental character of the guidelines.
do not share the document on the guidelines for employment politics, since it inspires in the ideas and the principles of the economic liberalism; without embargo, the European Parliament proposes #some indications to improve equality of opportunities among men and women in matter of employment, the constant research of dialogue among the social speakers and the necessary query and information of workers by part of companies.
But believe that, for a so difficult directive - and Parliament knows perfectly that it is difficult - have to take into account the reality of country, data of the social dialogue and postures of the social speakers, the distinct nuances, in #all points that have mentioned previously, and afterwards take a surgical combination, find a very fragile balance to have the greater possible hit.
No fits the lower doubt that in this important matter of family right, the extensive zone of absence of resultant right of the loss of efficiency of the judicial decisions in front of borders has affected juridical and morally to thousands of citizens and has prejudiced to the social and psychological stability of families, in particular his more fragile links that are women and boys.
The improvement of relations among #Grecia and *Turquía, no longer like merit of the earthquakes, but like a fact aside, and the change of attitude that notes in *Turquía with regard to the juridical and constitutional reform, in relation with the human rights and regarding posture in front of the *kurdos are #worthy advances of applause, as also they are it commitments and recognition of the reality that give off of the letter that Mr. *Bülent *Ecevit directed to Chancellor #german, Mr. #Gerhard *Schröder, in May of the present year.
resolution proposal constitutes a clear signal to the international community that, in spite of that #news on *Timor have disappeared of the main #european newspapers or have left to be the first #news of the most important televisions in *Europa, attention of the international community and of the European Union on this problem has to continue.
there #be not doubt that the seventeen years that *Mumia *Abu-#Jamal finishes to happen rotting in runners of death, after a parody of process, are related with the fact that it is #black, with fight against of the institutional racism, with freedom of opinion that has practised journalist, when having value to report corruption that reigns in rows of the police of *Filadelfia.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0050\/1999) of Mr. Newton *Dunn in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects on the initiative of the Federal Republic of *Alemania for the adoption of a decision of the Council (8357\/1999 - *C5-0011\/1999 - 1999\/0804(*SNS)) relative to the improvement of information exchange to combat the documents of false trip.
The fact that the #german Government have procured to avert the parliamentary examination posing this question in the field of the *tercer *pilar and the fact that the Presidency #finnish have not come at least to answer to our questions, was in the parliamentary commission, was in session *plenaria, regret to say that it is stain for the reputation of Finns, that up to now had an excellent reputation of opening and democracy.
In time that remains until *Helsinki, is fundamental that analyse also Right state, the situation of the human rights, respect to minorities, the protection and recognition of his cultural identity and support to measures directed to abolish pity capital, that is #one of the amendments to the Report *Morillon presented in our commission this week.
The proposal of the Commission do not tackles specifically the problems of pollution of the air acclimatise in the countries candidates, and had account of the imminent enlargement, consider little responsible that Parliament do not receive information relative to pollution levels in countries like *Polonia and the Czech Republic, #as well as on the #likely cost and the calendar that will be necessary to achieve that these countries adjust to the new norms.
Gentleman President, when hailing the Report of the Court of Accounts, so useful, and that this Assembly has to support because like this we support to *Europa, #can not avert *referirme to unrest that produces the that again they have been #some media the that have advanced partial versions and interested of the report, taken that apart from producing, gentleman *Karlsson, unnecessary damages to citizens, civil servants and institutions, gives the impression of that the Court of Accounts is a political organ that it has to *rendir accounts to the constituents through the public opinion.
And *yo believe that really Parliament, with action a bit more audacious of the Commission, a bit more ambitious and also -why not to say it- a bit more engaged with the reform process of the institutions, #can achieve that the *desencuentros that have produced in the past transform in harmony in the future and that we #can #all promote reform project of the European Union, knowing, as we know, that, #if they do not take in consideration and leave to the *margen worries of citizens, these reforms will not be able to concretise and will not be able to culminate with hit.
Only to confirm to Mrs. *Riis-*Jø*rgensen, #whose continuous and deep interest by the relative questions to the state help is very known and appreciated by the Commission, that investigation goes to continue, that the effective applicability of disposals relative to #SME is #one of worries and that in the analysis of #all investigations on state help have very present effects in trade among States members.
Without embargo, also want to manifest with clarity, so that it do not remain place to doubts, that the corresponding statements of the institutions, also on the subject of the review limited of the financial perspectives, that expect to receive of the Commission from the month of April, and the consequent answers of the Council, represent change operation, as #if it treated of change office of currencies, for saying it like this. And the one who no credits change, loses credit.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation (To5-0079\/1999) of Mr. *Bodrato, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement on establishment of technical regulations world-wide applicable to tyre vehicles, and to squads and pieces that #can mount or use in said vehicles ("Parallel Agreement") (10167\/1999 - *COM(1999) 27 - *C5-0073\/1999 - 1999\/0011(*AVC)).
Go to mention #some of actions assumed by the Commission, to stress that I am convinced that there #be a big field for a still greater activation so much of the Commission as of states members and that, of course, requires a specific politics for treatment of these subjects, so much in the frame of the preparation of follow-up meeting of the Conference of *Beijing, as, later, in the frame of the *quinto plan of action for woman.
On the base of restructuring of collaboration among the EU and *Centroamérica in the frame of Congress of Saint #José in #Florencia in 1996, and of strategy documents elaborated in 1999 for collaboration among the EU and *Nicaragua, have to indicate that, in collaboration for development with *Nicaragua in particular, the European Union concentrates *primordialmente in the strengthening of Right State and the promotion of a just social politics.
The fact is that the only person that really knows finances of the European Union, to know, the Boss of our Court of Accounts, Mr. *Friedmann, do not takes long was in work group Bread-*Europa here in the European Parliament and in exhibition *nos said that the costs of enlargement exaggerate enormously as they never include the costs of the no enlargement.
Equally is important that continue in the future the fine cooperation that have come developing among Request Commission and Defender of Village, and that #this succeed to time with defenders of the national village or with the corresponding institutions to be able to, of way, combat rapes of the rights of citizens that commit precisely in the community legislative frame.
Gentleman President, when talking today here, fifty-eight days before the elections to the European Parliament, in the last days of the operation of this European Parliament, seat that the conjoint debate on Request Commission and on Defender of the European Village has a special significance and comes, like a balance of #all a term of office *quinquenal, to give a message in these next elections.
Gentleman President, wanted to present a brief oral amendment that #would involve that competition regarding the new article 13 against of discrimination continued *recayendo in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens, but as with this amendment pretends to endow also of competitions to the Commission of Social Subjects and Employment, #would wish to present to this *respecto an oral amendment in the sense that, also by it that *respecta Right Commission of Woman, #would fit to take a small observation.
Although #some community legislative norms apply to vehicle users deprived -for example taxes on fuel, taxes on consumption, VAT-our current approach in matter of *tarificación centres in the commercial traffic, as it treats of a problem that only #can resolve with hit through a community statutory frame, that protect the operation of the inner market of transports to time that integrates totally the environmental goals.
In effect, fusions and scale economies in this sector, tendency to the «*megabancos» and to the agglutinations, the #tending technological developments to improve productivity, pressures on employment or even on dimension actors more regional, have his own logical, the *cual do not coincides necessarily with the general interest or with employment goals.
In reality, our Community has employed in depth in the fight against violence underlining value of the right to life, security, freedom and the physical and mental integrity with #all a series of programs like the that today we treat to perfect: program *DAPHNE that struggles against violence against women, teenagers and boys.
In the votes of yesterday in the morning, of decision proposal on number and competitions of the parliamentary commissions, Parliament approved two contradictory amendments regarding competitions in matter of juridical protection of consumers, to know, the amendment 31, of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, and the amendment 60, of the Group of the Popular Party European.
Like this as, have two requirements that formulate to #european level: that the calculation of restitutions to production take from price of corn to world-wide level, and no from price of wheat, because it is in industry of corn in the that bases industry of starch; and, second, that procure likewise -as they have remembered takes moment mates *Sonneveld and *Mulder- conserve a true balance among starch and starch produced from cereals.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted colleagues, of the recent conflicts with States Joined have learnt two things: first, the need to develop dialogue no only with the Americans but also with other regions of the world because we will need and, in fact, already need new allies, and second the need of a greater surveillance by part of the European Union of negotiations of the *OMC, having besides in account his increasing importance, all *ello is obviously a collective problem that *atañe also to the #european Parliament.
Like this things, no *me remains more that *decirles with the maximum clarity that am deeply conscious of this difficult moment and of the big confidence that have, #as well as of the fact that *me are to proof *ustedes and more still, #if it fits, the next Parliament, in front of the *cual will have to go back with squad of the Commission to the complete and, to *través of squad of the Commission, will have to offer a concrete guarantee of the promises and of commitments that have assumed in the debate of 13 April and in the debate of today.
Coincide, in wide majority, in the radical conviction of the criminal practices designated of ethnic cleansing, of the that it is guilty *Milosevic, in that we have to show solidarity specifically with refugees, in affirmation of the right of these last to return to country and in the need to guarantee respect of this right by means of the presence of an international strength in a *Kosovo to the that *le concede a real autonomy and, finally, in the perspective of a conference on the *Balcanes.
In relation with the #another proposal that the Council has been asking, to know, the audits of our general diets of secretariat, there #be not reason so that on 20 July, #if we do not have an agreement on the statute of deputies, do not have to say that it will carry out an annual audit of the general diets of secretariat that have to present to Parliament, made by auditors of *bona *vide and that it was precise to present to Parliament so that deputies receive his annual diets.
The Commission approved the text of the conjoint statement in meeting of the past 9 March; the Council took it the past week, and corresponds now to Parliament give agreement, with the end that the three Presidents #can confirm the agreement of institutions to the conjoint statement in signature ceremony this week.
Basing in this strategy, Parliament, in his first reading, integrated in an only regulation so much regulation proposal of the relative Council to the structural measures of the sector *pesquero, integrated in Diary 2000, as equally regulation proposal of the Council by the that they defined modalities and conditions of interventions with structural purpose in the sector of fishing.
Has a stable democracy, and although for countries has *prorrogado a year the financial protocol no exist structures for stage of *preadhesión, and #if it thinks in species of *mini *PHARE, then #would request that the Commission showed prompt to candidates the perspectives under the *cuales #can begin stage of *preadhesión, so that they receive planning security that the other since precisely *nosotros the that come of States members greater of the European Union also #would owe *sentirnos managers of the small candidates.
Consider that this case confirms also the fine diplomatic utilisation of argument recently arisen in the international political scene: that the international community #can not use two weights and two measures; that the international community, *cuando demands respect of the human rights in *Kosovo, has to be consistent with the requirement of respect in parts of the world.
Regarding death pity and the establishment of a universal moratorium of the capital executions, as *ustedes know, the past 28 April, precisely the European Union took the initiative to present in front of the Commission of Human Rights resolution project on the question of death pity.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0253\/99) of Mrs. *Gebhardt, for the Delegation of Parliament in the Conciliation Committee, on the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes recognition mechanism of titles for the professional activities to that refer liberalisation directives and of transitory measures and completes the general system of recognition of titles (3612\/99 - *C4-0209\/99-96\/0031(*COD))
Like general indication of the opinion that *sustenta the Commission about the questions that poses the proposal subjected to the Assembly, remit to His *Señorías to the final section of the statement of the Commission of 1 July 1999, in the that manifested the opinion that «it #would be advisable of face the future clear the application of article 213 regarding activities of members of the Commission after having ceased in charge».
#Such as I have commented previously, have been speaker in a series of questions, and #can take a brief outline of *cuán extensive will be this review and of it that will cover: universal services, frequencies, satellites, regulation, licences, interconnections, numbering, mobile telephones, convergence of the *radiotelevisión, data transmission and telecommunications; which means an explosion of legislation and affects to an enormous segment of the industrial and commercial base of the European Union by own right, but also like help of #many industries.
Is true, of course have arisen some gigantic problems in *Bélgica and of course the European Commission, with reason, has said that in the #belgian situation have committed some grave errors; but the colleagues Deputies, that to these heights know at least *algo of file, know that the #belgian Government has taken some very drastic measures and that now #can give guarantees to #all consumers of #all the #european Union.
With regard to the subjects that President designated has posed on reform, that Commissioner *Kinnock will present the next month of February with the owed query, politics program of the next month of January, the imperative moral and politician to confront the challenge of enlargement and the preparation of the Conference *Intergubernamental, promise that my Group will assume a positive and constructive commitment with the Commission in this sense.
As frankly I believe that in the attempt of #some in moving his domestic debates to the community institutions; in #some governments that play with the #european charges to satisfy requirements of pacts in countries, and also in #some parties in the opposition that want to elevate to instances it that do not achieve home, like the of Mr. Baron, in *España, to the one who *le have commanded to prolong the internal electoral debate attacking -and *él knows it- of unfair and disloyal way to vice-president proposed of the European Commission.
Tomorrow, deputy group of diverse political groups will initiate works to create a *intergrupo that work in this sense, with the intention to create a spirit of cooperation with the Commission and with the Institutions of the Union in the sense that the collective rights and recognition are a prolongation of recognition of the individual rights.
Product of negotiations among governments, paper is the to contribute to create the most favourable conditions for multinationals in his permanent efforts for increasing benefits to coast of his own employees, the most recent example is the of *Michelin, and besides, in damage of the majority of the population of the European Union and of the poorest villages.
since tomorrow we will not be able to vote in favour of determined Commissioners and place that #can not take state with my individual vote in this Assembly that my colleague Mr. *Patten #would be an excellent Commissioner of External Subjects, simply do not have more option that vote against of this Commission in group to send the message to Mr. *Prodi and to colleagues that #if they go out chosen, will have to answer in front of Parliament, accept that things #can not follow as up to now and that we have to change of habits #if we want *infundir to the population of *Europa confidence that have to have in Parliament and institutions.
As they explain the workers of humanitarian help of the international community, the Cross employees #Red International and of other organisations of human rights were forced to abandon the zone, with the end to be able to commit crimes without the presence of foreign witnesses.
The Council also has expressed worry by the fact that, in addition to the #serbian population, other ethnic groups no *albanos have seen forced to abandon *Kosovo; in this sense, the Council has remembered that in virtue of the resolution 1244 of the Security Council of the UN, #all refugees and the displaced have right to return to zones of origin.
)#Can, then, be acceptable that, after the competent organ of the European Union considered timely to raise the prohibition, determined States, without presenting neither take public a clear justification from sight point of the *inocuidad of foods, keep the relative prohibition to meat of bovine? This decision, adopted by the #french Government the past week, constitutes hit particularly last for the *criadores of bovine livestock of *Escocia, #whose herds are fed predominantly with grass and that, first of all, did not have problem of *EEB.
Without embargo, as it has affirmed here, the subject did not remains resolved with program, but that the increase of the sustainable use of sources of renewable energy demands still study, pilot projects, the exchange of results in investigation, harmonisation of legislation, the review of attitudes, campaigns of information #as well as private and public investments, that will amortise only in the future.
Is a modern agreement that adjusts to the needs of times. Loans special attention to liberalisation of rates, to the creation of a zone of free trade, to commitments in the field of development and of the economic cooperation, to commitments in terrain of science and technology and to the relative commitments to the political dialogue.
Subject: Measures of the Commission to restrict armament transfer and promote the, disarmament Taking into account the *primer annual report that will publish *próximamente on the #european code of behaviour relative to armament transfer for 1998, #can indicate the responsible commissioner for the external relations #if it #would support enlargement of competitions of the Commission to include the subjects referents to arm trade in the next Conference *Intergubernamental?
In consequence, to my understand, it is necessary to ask to President of the Commission, to the Council and to #all *nosotros that keep and respect #all the agreements with the #turkish State, and that keep besides a punctual action and it more specific possible of the competent organs of the Community, oriented to follow attentively that the process of democratisation and the peaceful solution to divergences with the States carry advance specifically and no only to hit of statements of the #turkish State.
Happen to other three subjects: the protection of the environment, health of consumers and the audiovisual sector, that, further of the existent tensions among technical progress and cultural traditions, reflect shots of civilisation that *singularizan to *Europa: quality requirement -for example, in the field of feeding-, the cultural identity in an open world, preference by it "no *vendible" in number of activities.
Subject: free Sales of taxes #Can the Council inform of strategy to help to airports, ports, aerial lines and companies of maritime transport of *pasajeros of *Irlanda to surpass the loss of income that results of the suppression of the free sales of taxes? How foresees the Council protect to consumers against the *encarecimiento of notes, boost and protect employment and support the development of essential infrastructures, *cuando all *eso took before thanks to the free sales of taxes?
Have said "stone angular" , because from the year happened Parliament has to observe the most rigorous disposals of the that apply to almost #all the other #european parliaments by it that refers to the statement of the financial interests of deputies and has already in the Regulation #one of disposal groups more rigorous that apply to group behaviour of interest in the frame of the institution.
Gentleman President, with rhythms of development underneath of the 2%, with a new promotion of the interests, with deflation and with a rigorous application of the stability pact, intensifies pressure to the rights of social security and to the social rights of workers, and the immediate result is impairment of conditions of life and of the labour conditions of workers.
Although no fit doubt that transparency has increased and, for example, information sessions after the meetings of Government Council have represented a clear improvement in work methods, the goal has to be the continuation of the increase of the opening, #as well as that the operation of the Bank consolidate and was possible to leave backwards the problems of the initial stage.
Regarding transparency, to the *cual define like the *ofrecimiento to the public or to Parliament of the maximum possible information on the evolution of the economy, on the monetary evolution, on the result of the deliberations of Government Council, create -and like this *me manifested in my introductory intervention-, that the Central Bank European #can watch directly to the eyes of any central bank of the world.
In States members - history of these years *nos remembers it - exist cases of restructuring: history, as I finish to say, is full of cases of restructurings, *deslocalizaciones, closings of companies - Mr. *Wurtz has referred to #some of *ellos - that no only reduce employment, but that put in danger the economic and social cohesion of the zones affected, create a climate of social insecurity among workers and a climate that no favours at all development and growth.
Even believe that have interest, in the field of the legislative and institutional interventions, the proposals on transfer of taxation, of the territory of the labour cost, of taxation of workers, to the territory of the environment. And already there #be a *primer positive breath of the directives on employment, in this direction.
Regarding the nuclear arms, exist two essential documents. By part is the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms, in the that the countries with armament type have forced to *desactivar his nuclear arms to change that countries no the manufacture and, by #another, the Treaty of total prohibition of nuclear proofs, that is extraordinarily important since proofs are to develop the nuclear armament.
Gentleman President, to time that *subscribo the words of the colleagues that *me have preceded, wanted to express, in name of the Group *Europa of Nations, the enormous joy that, in world many times motivated by a hierarchy of interests and no by a hierarchy of values, Parliament recognise to a valuable man that struggled by value, the of freedom of village, and *le concede prize *Sajarov.
Nevertheless, in Austrian quality, have to manifest, second, that dialogue among the social speakers, among the political institutions, among the fiscal politics and the political mandators, comes developing and practising under an analogous form from takes years in my country, *Austria, and has contributed of appreciable way to that *Austria #can present now like a country with a high level of employment and unemployment figures inferior to the of countries.
In moment in that the economic recovery #would allow at the same time a reduction of the public deficit and support politics to growth, an effective coordination of the budgetary politics centred *prioritariamente in investments *infraestructurales, investigation, education and training #can have effect of economic reflation durable.
In these proposals demands to States members that force to reach a balance among men and women in places of direction, to appoint to number of men and women in the committees and groups of work in the EU, to improve legislation of the labour market so that #this reflect the problems and needs of women and to form to persons that design the national guidelines of politics of employment so that they integrate more effectively criteria of equality of opportunities in work and, finally, to that in the countries members establish goals *mensurables of annual character.
did not has felt that we have to negotiate with the European Commission, after #all events of the last months, a new code of behaviour that, among things, insist in that, *cuando have subjects of importance, the Commission has to come to say to this Assembly #which are these subjects first, and afterwards has to initiate a procedure, like the annual report of the Court of Accounts, and say: there #be had leak, is unpleasant, but follow with the subject as #if #nothing had happened.
Already has remembered in interventions that, takes #some years, the European Parliament had promoted pilot projects in support of the no governmental organisations and of the local authorities that, from takes time, confront with actions of fight against violence to women and boys: a phenomenon, #this of violence to women and boys, by misfortune, no only very spread, but that goes in increase and that self-evident under forms increasingly sophisticated and, therefore, more difficult to combat.
Insist in the current logic of cost, in the that stands out the corresponding to the Common Agricultural Politics, that, in addition to put in *entredicho equity goal recognised like principle in the Treaties, of politics only has denomination, insist in income system in vigour, fruit of diverse and contradictory interests among yes, results *indefectiblemente *inconciliable with deepening wish of the enlargement project of the geographic space.

Although Prime minister #turkish have declared the next day of the Summit that belonging to the European Union was for *Turquía, quote: "a right of birth" -it that gives, by it other, an idea of modesty with the *cual is decided to open the door of the European Union-, is evident for #all observers that conserve the free mind that entrance #would change deeply nature of the Union.
States members of the European Union have to answer to questions by it that refers to his own support in the past to the #indonesian authorities *cuando #this *oprimía to village of *Timor Oriental, and by the fact that these countries and manufacture companies of armament have obtained enormous benefits to coast of innocent lives, of the welfare and of the right of persons to live freely, without being subjected to tightness #any neither to rapes of the human rights.
In summary, it is necessary to say that, in any case, enlargement of the European Union eastwards will have a positive repercussion in the #european environment, since adhesion will see accompanied by an environmental rule more strict in these countries candidates, the economic growth will endow of a sustainable base and the own countries will be able to fulfil the international agreements in environmental matter.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0136\/99) of Mrs. *Peijs, in name of the Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary and of Industrial Politics, on decision proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Decision of 19 December 1996 by the that adopts action program for customs in the Community ( "Customs 2000») (*COM(98)0644 - *C4-0639\/98-98\/0314(*COD)).
That the military aggression of NATO was the cause of the dramatic aggravation of the humanitarian situation of the region of the *Balcanes, put in risk stability of the political future of that region and in grave danger the world-wide peace remains to *obscuras for the political blindness of this majority that before prefers to insist in agreements that never were accepted by the negotiators, are only *imposiciones negotiators of NATO and put in risk sovereignty, borders and ancestral realities.
Wish to underline urgency and the need of intervention of NATO in the region to protect the fundamental rights of the population of *Kosovo and signal that this tragedy perhaps #would have been able to avert #if the European Union, in addition to being an economic and monetary institution, had been from takes time also a unitary political reality.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the second inform (To4-0114\/99) of Mr. go *Dam, in name of Transport Commission and Tourism, on directive proposal of the Council by the that modifies the Directive 96\/53\/*CE of the Council by the that establish, for determined vehicles of road that circulate in the Community, the maximum dimensions authorised in the national and international traffic and the maximum weights authorised in the international traffic (*COM(98)0414 - *C4-0486\/98-98\/0227(*SYN))
In *tercer place, *les signal that, apart from the regulate attention that the Council of Ministers loans to the #burmese question, attention has manifested also in the suspension of the conference EU-*ASEAN, foreseen for the past month or six weeks ago in *Berlín, since it #can not reach an agreement regarding the participation of *Birmania and because the special formula offered by the Council so that the question of the human rights in *Birmania #can treat with the #burmese, was not accepted by the *ASEAN.
Also will be able to enjoy of fiscal advantages small and medium enterprises that believe employment in city without prejudice surroundings. actions complete with the creation of models of sustainable tourism that #can include rule that regulate access to city in periods of maximum influx and measures of support directed to the local economy that base in the sustainable use of the natural resources and the historical heritage of city.
To initiative of Commissioner *Flynn, the Commission has examined the problem of the future of the social security and have taste in saying -recently to instances also of the Presidency #german and of the European Parliament- that very prompt go to present a communication on pension bottoms, in the that will take out the conclusions that give off of the application of the Green Book.
Therefore, the proposal that take, and that know that it is the General Direction *I, is the to create compensation bottom and to propose to the budgetary Authority include in the budget, precisely for *facilitarles to *ustedes, to our common commercial politics, means, bottom, reservation that #can compensate to the #european companies that they are innocent victims of this just and necessary common commercial politics.
The goal of these proposals is modernisation of the administration and the politics of personnel, the solution of the problems in the field of the budgetary management, the financial control and the fight against fraud, #as well as reform of the financial management by means of a financial control more effective.
But is likewise contrary, evidently, to the Letter of Nations Joined, that establishes explicitly that the use of strength, except in case of legitimate defence, will be reserved to permissions of the Security Council, to the that has ignored with an incredible cynicism in despise of this fundamental law of the international society: has not requested permission of the Security Council, because it knew that the Council #would not give it.
Gentleman President, *cuando #one visits *Belgrado #can not leave to feel ire and indignation in front of show of the destruction and death caused by bombardments of NATO, neither #can leave to feel admiration by strength and value of village #serbian, to feel *conmovido by form and the content of demonstrations of village that transforms in shield alive to protect the bridges of *Belgrado.
In the meantime, in the world-wide level and in spite of manipulation generalised, the self-evident public opinion and demands intervention of Nations Joined and a political solution that allow the return of refugees and respect of the current borders, the Americans and the #european Governments subordinated #his talk of terrestrial operations, answer with the called «total war» that all considers it strategic white, rehabilitate and rearm movement that till lately #all considered terrorist and fundamentalist.
But fortunately, achieved this commitment in *Berlín, to the that *sucedieron negotiations among the Council, Parliament and, of course, the Commission, that brought three positive changes: the *primer change concerned to the community initiative *Urban; the second to the European Bottom of Regional Development, on actions by culture and tourism, and the *tercer change *atañe to the special emphasis that the Regulation of the European Bottom of Regional Development puts in the insular regions.
are not the financial pot of the that #one #can serve freely *cuando in *algún that spot needs money but that they are a half to boost a very concrete goal, to know, the to boost the economic and social cohesion of this Union and stand out in practice the principle that solidarity is #one of the essential foundations for the existence of the #european Union.
The Council of «General Subjects» has underlined in meeting of 26 April 1999 the intention of the European Union to respect fully the last decision of the *OMC in war of banana and to modify of the corresponding mood and without delay diet for bananas of the EU.
Subject: Contracting of civil servants without the previous celebration of an opposition In answer to my relative question to the intention to hire to collaborators pertinent of the secretariat of *Schengen, the Council indicates that, of compliance with article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen *anejo to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, is forced to integrate to personnel of *Schengen, since this Protocol has to be considered like part of the Treaty and, therefore, like part of the primary community Right.
Gentleman President, my colleague, Mr. *Hoppenstedt already has explained -and very well- the position of my Group on the report of Mrs. *Oddy, to the one who *le give graces; but, in the agitated debate that has developed on purpose of the electronic trade in *Europa and of the difficult question of the content in line, of origin, of destination, of legality, #can say and underline that in the public networks, like Internet, has to have spot for freedom of expression.
Gentleman President, *permítame that conclude my intervention with the following words. Expect of heart -*usted will be able to check it in person- that the next Parliament continue this debate, that do not sacrifice it in name of the economic subjects or the subjects related with enlargement, by important that are, but that consider the question of the human rights like a political goal #whose materialisation depends of politics of the #european Union, and especially of the external politics and politics in matter of enlargement.
#Can *usted confirm that the Table agreed yesterday send a delegation to see to Mr. *Rugova and, #if #this is the case, #can *usted call attention of the political groups on Article 9.1 of the code of behaviour, Annex 1, Articles 1 and 2, that establishes that before Deputy #can be appointed *válidamente for the exercise of a mandate, or take part in an official delegation, has to have completed in form owed the planned statement in Article 2?
Declare restarted session period of the European Parliament, interrupted on 7 May 1999, and opened the planned session in section 3 of article 10 of Record relative to the election of the representatives in the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, #as well as in section 3 of article 10 of the Regulation of Parliament.
Of course is well that in Colony have *desbrozado the path for reforms, but *nosotros have an answer for the *interrogantes that has posed *usted here, gentleman President of the Council, in relation with the widest perspective of enlargement of the European Union and the institutional configuration of our Union, for #this *interrogantes have an answer and this answer is clear: wish a big reform of the previous institutions to enlargement.
#All this process of change will require time, but already have set up a first reorganisation of the Commission: will simplify and *racionalizará the bureaucratic device reducing the number of General Directions; Commissioners will have offices, or was, cabinets, in building of the General Directions to charge; cabinets and Commissioners will be more agile and more *supranacionales.
*Me states, like speaker of the recent managerial on earth filling, that it that is is that the European Commission is norms on the base that they go to be approved and adequately applied in States members whereas, to time, direction general of the European Union knows perfectly that in areas of politics no exist inspections able of *averiguar #if norms are applied in #some States members of the European Union.
And in front of this dangerous panorama no only do not remain indifferent, no only condemn it, and vote against of the new Commission, but that besides call to workers and to villages of *Europa to carry advance fights, to raise a wall against the disastrous plans that *ciernen on future, the call to *darle turn to the current situation, by #one *Europa different, by a *Europa of villages, of peace and solidarity, of the mutually beneficial collaboration.
Thus I believe that our more urgent task consists in fulfilling the previous conditions to the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice. In concrete, have to begin for elaborating Letter of fundamental rights #european place that no treats only to centralise the state and police power, but that also it is necessary *europeizar the rights of citizens.
have taken It so much more easily what that the procedure chosen for said auditions has allowed to remember commitment contracted by the Commission to present, before the end of the year 1999, a group of proposals allocated to give at last concrete content to section 2 of article 299 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that consecrates the specificity of the regions *ultraperiféricas and *instituye in *pro of *ellas the right to particular disposals, derogatory, for *permitirles confront his structural difficulties.
On the other hand, for treating of the *PTU associated to the European Union, Commissioner *Nielson has recognised the need to present with the greater shortness a group of proposals directed to give to countries a statute adapted to his current situation with seen to the next agreement of association, with the consequence in particular of the renewal of the financial instrument assigned to development.
treats of a political decision that the parliamentary commission and the Commission of Budgetary Control have to adopt, and the message that, therefore, it is necessary to transmit to Mrs. *Schreyer -#if it do not comes from of *usted, Mr. Commissioner, that come from, at least, of services of the Commission- is that we want to celebrate early a meeting with Mrs. *Schreyer to argue about the content of a *PRS5 that it will have to present to Parliament it before possible and, it that it is even more important, include the additional personnel for *OLAF.
This Agreement went in in vigour on 24 October 1996 and goal is to reach and keep a high level of nuclear security to scale world-wide, developing national measures and tightening the international cooperation, #as well as cater to the nuclear head offices of effective protections in front of possible radioactive leakages so that individuals, society and the environment find to save of the harmful effects of the pertinent ionic radiations of head offices.
Support it that has said before Mr. *Swoboda, but in front of the situation that have at present in *Turquía, is to say, in front of disposal to take advantage of relations with the #european speakers, in the resolution proposal of today #would have to talk of mood much more concretise on helps to *Turquía and show to friends #turkish that are here *cuando need help and *transmitirles the feeling of that they are not seen by *nosotros of a general mood like enemies, it that before the earthquake with frequency was like this.
The main purpose is to give break to the budget *rectificativo and supplementary *nº 4\/99, approved the past 16 September, proposing, in accordance with the proposal formulated by the Commission in moment, fund greater credits; to know: for *PHARE 98 millions of euros, for *TACIS 68 millions of euros, for the humanitarian helps to *Turquía 15 millions of euros, for *Kosovo 21 millions of euros, for cooperation with *Sudáfrica 20 millions of euros, for the environment and the tropical forests 10 millions of euros.
#If I have not understood badly, the next week will be *usted available also to examine the relative questions to enlargement, but, like general principle, it that has initiated *usted today here is important and #would appreciate the opportunity to continue dialogue among our two institutions by means of appropriate mechanisms and formalised, already take part *usted personally or by mediation of members of Commissioner School, as it proceed, in celebration weeks of partial periods of sessions, in function of the agenda.
In equality of conditions, #if it wants to, #can situate it in the first place, without embargo, in my opinion, the problem of the human resources is dramatically important for our continent and, #if no *le put remedy with urgency by means of a very wide program that take part in this sector, believe that not even the reduction of taxes, in spite of having a content and to offer a very strong contribution, will suffice to achieve development of the #european industry.
The *segunda question, that is related with the main object of my question, is #if it has not thought the Commission that, of way that there #be a directive, the directive *SEVESO, that foresees the protection of workers and of citizens, in the zones of facilities, in front of accidents in industrial companies, it #would be necessary to take #some measures for the protection, of the industrial companies especially, in front of natural catastrophes like seisms.
It that then *sucedería is that the European Union *jactaría to have reduced pollution, to have reduced broadcasts, but to price of, in the first place, the loss of places of #european work, and second, the world #would not have reduced pollution levels in it more minimum; simply #would have exported pollution.
This plan proposes also measures oriented to diverse sectors of consumption and allocated to intensify knowledges in matter of energy and practice in spheres like the acquisition of appliances, energy utilisation in home, facilities of buildings, heating systems, the energetic management in industry, the sector of services and the public sector.
Wanted to add that, along the debate celebrated on 14 October in the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, and to sight of worry shown in particular by article 2, #all members of the commission agree amendment that now appears like last paragraph of article 2 and that prays it following: "Said article will apply without damage of confidentiality requirements established in the law, or was, in the Treaties, or established in the Regulation of the European Parliament" .
Is, for the European Union, occasion to reaffirm his moral duty that consists in tending hand to the world in development; occasion to show until how point want to struggle against poverty, against injustice, against discriminations of type, against the fault of democracy, against attacks to the human rights and against freedom.
In front of this Central Bank or to this saint Bank - do not know exactly how describe it -, of the *cual vice-president, Mr. *Noyer, *nos explained recently of form affected, but in English, until how point #this felt manager of the long term *cuando the governments yielded to the whims of the short term since they were subjected to uncertainties of the universal suffrage, front, therefore, to power of this Bank, the excellent report of Mr. *Huhne demands more transparency, without *atreverse on the other hand to *reclamarle it that it #can happen by exhibition, is to say, go out of anonymity of the decisions.
The #european citizens, gentleman President, interest and concern mainly by the content of politics of the Central Bank European, of the European Union and of States members; politics that gives absolute priority to the called monetary stability and to the interests of the big financial capital, and price that have to pay is a dramatic reduction of employment and the total destruction of the called social model European.
The monetary orientations of #ECB, that base in fulfillment of the Stability Pact and of criteria of nominal convergence and prevail price stability, finish being determinants for the national and #european politics in the most diverse economic and social spheres, included the budgetary perspectives of the European Union and of States members.
As probably it expected Parliament, the summit was dominated inevitably by the direct conversations on *Chechenia, as it has indicated the Presidency, in the that the European Union *presionó by a reduction of climbing, by turn to the political dialogue, by a proportional utilisation of strength to cut across terrorism and by that find a solution to the humanitarian crisis.
In this sense, want to manifest my coincidence with Mr. *Hatzidakis and with *algún orator and regret that the European Committee of Normalisation have not reached still an agreement that #would allow to States members legislate according to it that it has to be the definite rule; and not seeing *abocados, #if it is that today and along the next weeks are not able to modify the current Managerial, to legislate to go back to change shortly time legislation, with #all the problems that *ello #would involve.
In the case of *Marruecos and of fishing agreement, neither is possible to go back to ignore the rights of village *saharaui, beginning by right to self-determination, right to constitute an independent State, #if it opts thus, and to protect the natural wealths of territory, already treat of the *yacimientos of phosphate or, in particular, of resources of his maritime seaboard, that find loomed by this agreement.
The question of the alimentary security has converted in look of crucial importance in societies, #would say even a requirement of our *conciudadanos Thus, think that it is precise to proceed to scientific examinations more exhaustive in breast of the Scientific Committee taking into account #all the most recent data in wait of diagnostic proofs precocious that #can apply to animals alive and reinforcing controls to #all levels.
In the first place, #that, like the social speakers or the Central Bank, that have a direct influence in factors of the equation #such as training of wages or level of interest types and afterwards, second, in a particular group, the European Commission and advisers of the Commission with seen, for example, to the combination of politics.
the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0041\/1999) of Mrs. *Smet, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Directive 93\/104\/*CE of the relative Council to determined looks of ordination of work time, to include the sectors and activities excluded of said Managerial (8642\/1\/1999 - *C5-0036\/1999 - 1998\/0318 (*COD)).
And among the socialist amendments, there #be #one, that put of relief Mrs. *Wallis, that signals the special position of the regions *ultraperiféricas, that find totally separated of the community territory, very moved away of *él and that, therefore, in the application of the community Right, of compliance with the new article 299.2 of the Treaty, #can not be regulated by norms that apply to the community inner market in the continental field.
In effect, like European Union and like States members, #would have to have value to ask and favour the entrance of *cientos of thousands of persons that, today, only by the fact to come of out of the European Union #can cover works with innovation level higher because it is not only training of drama hand, of work strength at present existent inside the European Union that it #can take it.
. (IN) Gentleman President, the Commission has the pleasure to take part in it that it is the final step for the adoption of Program *Daphne 2000-2003, action program community, of four years of length, based in experience of the initiative *Daphne, *cuando the European Parliament in 1997, for the first time, included budgetary games to combat violence against boys, teenagers and women.
The Commission has employed in the last years credits to ensure service security of the nuclear head offices on the that today talk here while no *desconecten, #if well measures centre in improving security culture in countries, in creation of authorities supervisory independent or in the training of persons that #can exert supervision.
Known is that in the European Union keeps in levels elevated violence against boys, teenagers and women, it that constitutes rape of right to life, security, freedom, the dignity and the physical and emotional integrity, #as well as a grave threat for the physical and mental health of the victims of violence.
The central goals in the case of *Afganistán are, #among others, the achievement of a stable peace, the promotion of the internal dialogue in *Afganistán backing, in particular, the fundamental paper of Nations Joined, advance of the stabilisation and of development of *Afganistán by means of peace and the intensification of the fight against the illegal drugs and terrorism.
But, to answer to the question, #would signal that in *Yugoslavia, taking into account, for example, measures of the police and his aggressive behaviour to demonstrations, #as well as attitude of diet of *Milosevic to the press and to freedom of information, the current circumstances are #such, that, by moment, do not give the necessary conditions to organise some free democratic elections in *Yugoslavia.
Without embargo, this report collects fundamental principles that *nos seem essential, like the principle of caution, norms on methods and production procedures; the report takes upsetting, in particular, in labeling of foods, to guarantee the application of the alimentary security, and in the need to adopt a more favourable position to the countries in roads of development.
building *antipopular, *antidemocrático and authoritarian, built to serve to the big capital, will be demolished by the own villages, by means of resistance, intervention, change of strength correlation. To build the *Europa of peace and cooperation, of friendship and equality among villages, of the true Democracy and of Freedom, of the economic prosperity in benefit of workers.
Is important that in this legislative diary collect the special treatments that establishes section 2 of article 299 of the Treaty *CE for the #french departments of *Ultramar, the *Azores, *Madeira and the Canarian islands, because, of not being like this, #would get to a position and to a situation in the *cual these #european regions, vital for each #one of States and for the European Union, #would find in absolute disadvantage regarding the group of the European Union.
Curiously, disarmament *arancelario of the *APIM has not produced the effect wished in the sensitive industries of Canarians, by it that the #spanish authorities, the #canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested to the community authorities the modification of the Regulation *nº 1911\/91 so as to paralyse disarmament of the *APIM until June of the year 2000, subject that the European Commission has understood.
And finally, *permítanme take a reference to an absolutely key subject for *nosotros: growth, stability and employment, subject in the that line initiated in *Luxemburgo, followed in *Cardiff, Colony and *Helsinki, has to concretise in the next summit of face to the Presidency #portuguese because we understand that, to have a prosperous future in the Union, have to be able to be more competitive and generate more economic growth, but putting emphasis in employment and in the social cohesion, that is and has to be #ours first priority.
*Yo believe that #all agree in that citizens and citizen of *Europa have right to breathe a healthier air, and in the last publication of the European Agency of Environment signals that in the majority of cities reigns pollution of the air that results hurtful for health and that in the 115 #european cities of greater size almost 40 millions of persons are subjected to an upper level to the established in the guidelines for the quality of the air of the WHO, regarding a *contaminante at least.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5­0064\/1999) of Mrs. *González *Álvarez, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer, on the common position adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes follow-up plan of specific broadcasts averages of dioxide of carbon of the new tourisms (*COM(1998) 348  *C­0041\/1999  1998\/0202(*COD)).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0044\/1999) of Mr. *Sjöstedt, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer, on decision proposal of the Council on the approval, in name of the Community, of the amendments to the Annexes of the Agreement on the protection of the half marine of the zone of the sea *Báltico (Agreement of *Helsinki) (*COM(1999) 128 - *C4-0218\/1999 - 1999\/0077(*CNS)).
To reflect in the text of the proposal a suitable treatment of problem no resolved, in breast of the Council is *consensuando the incorporation of a new point 7 in the that they collect the external characteristics that they have to gather, for commercialisation in the #mediterranean areas of the Community, the better forest species adapted to his difficult conditions of floor and climate.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, #all agree in that the common coin constitutes the previous condition so that the inner market work, in that a stable coin constitutes also contribution to the social and economic security of *Europa and in that, by reason, the euro is also, in definite, a successful history as it has had like consequence the reduction of deficit in States members and descent of inflation.
Although in this subject commitment in our commission was especially arduous, the facts seem *darnos reason since, after the political agreement reached in the Council of last ministers, so much tuna loins like herring go out of suspension system *arancelarias, in addition to another series of corrections that affect to products comprised in the annex *V.
In it *concerniente to producer organisations, is truth that it is necessary *responsabilizarlas even more, #if it fits, so much regarding the organisation of the market as to the rational management of resources; without embargo, #would be convenient -and in this sense underline the relevance of the amendment 67, presented by my political Group- that States members #can concede complementary helps to producer organisations that boost measured of assessment of species fished and of *adecuación of offer to demand through structural actions of the *IFOP.
Gentleman President, Commissioner *Lamy and orators have referred to the meeting of *Seattle like a failure, but follow believing that #if the European Union and States Joined, in particular, learn the lesson of these last weeks, the meeting of *Seattle #can happen to history no like a failure, but like moment in that the leaders of the world gave account at last that they have to focus the international trade of a radically different way.
In general terms, treats of approach or, better said, of an intention *loable and in line with the Protocol of *Montreal that to time, without embargo, do not takes into account #some facts. In the first place, the fact that the countries signatories of the Protocol, among the *cuales are States Joined, foresee terms longer for the cessation of production of the *hidroclorofluorocarburos; second, that the *hidroclorofluorocarburos, to sight of the current knowledges, represent the only true alternative, in the field of the *antiincendio, to the *halógenos, main enemies of ozone coat, #whose use is generalised in the countries in roads of development.
. Gentleman President, Program *TACIS has devoted his best efforts to support to *Mongolia, *Rusia and the rest of the New Independent States in reform realisation and in the political and administrative restructuring of his social and economic institutions to facilitate the construction of a democratic society that support in market economy free.
To finalise wanted to reiterate my gratitude to #all the colleagues of the Environment Commission, Public and Political Health of Consumers for having given green light to the amendments presented by the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Consider fundamental that the European Parliament talk today with an alone voice and issue a univocal signal regarding this crucial subject for consumers.
criticise the decision to develop means of the European Union for the military management of crisis, in the field of a #european common politics reinforced in matter of security and defence, conceived in development and the strengthening of the *pilar #european of NATO, of mood that refuse the militaristic vision of resource to war for the resolution of international conflicts.
On our part, do not see any better solution that the restoration of a new international order of trade, that respect sovereignty of States, rhythm and development modalities, that respect traditions also, traditions that will not dissolve of hit of magic wand because we will have imposed the elections, the human rights and it that call, too much *apresuradamente, democracy.

The resolution approved yesterday by Parliament will remain in the political history of this hemicycle like a characteristic central piece of the total absence by heart political, *definidora of the political hysteria that today is imposed by manipulation *mediática to interest service *belicistas and aggressors and takes to forget values of peace, justice and sovereignty of nations.

Like breweries *luxemburguesas #would not take at all in reaching said ceiling given the reduced dimensions of market, this rule #would end in a totally absurd situation. #Can give the case that a big #german brewery, as for example the *Bitburger, #whose production surpasses with grow the of the greater brewery *luxemburguesa, #can follow signing agreements of supply of beer in *Luxemburgo with the bars *luxemburgueses, since it still #would not have reached the limit of the 40 % in the enormous market of #german reference, whereas brewery *luxemburguesa no longer #would have this right and #would remain deleted.
This discussion comes of long and *yo say therefore that the European Commission acts in #this as #if it was the secretariat of the conservative strengths of #ECB, that argue that the *segunda task that has #ECB according to article 105 of the Treaty, is to say support to the economic politics *cuando price stability remains sufficiently ensured, already is it sufficiently attended guaranteeing price stability same.
*Cuando in the preparation of the Summit of *Luxemburgo presented the proposal on the designated social VAT -by true, was not the first because already *me had preceded #some *selectos members of Parliament- was convinced of acting following the spirit of the White Book of *Delors, that already had signalled that in *Europa *nos had dipped in head a system that has #put a lot work, very expensive in comparison with the *despilfarro of energy, of matters prevail and with the total freedom of circulation of capitals.
*Usted has situated the market in the central place and has declared that it is precise to take advantage of fully and in whole the opportunities that #this offers, since #this is road more adapted for promote growth and employment, but also has mentioned the frame of conditions and rules of the game *equitativas that they are necessary, since the market no the establishes by himself\/hisself same.

The Presidency #german of the EU always has marked like goal inform to the European Parliament on advances of the *preparativos related with integration of *Schengen.

Entrust in that the request of the European Parliament carry so much to the Council as to the Commission to quantify the financial endowment and\/or population number admitted and the possibility to be able to award helps of State, without damage of *falsear competition, on the base of the letter *c) of section 3 of article 92 of the Treaty, as it has taken in cases called special.
The Group of the Greens votes against the recommendation on the regulation of Cohesion Bottom because in *él has not had seriously in account almost #any of the innovative requests formulated by the European Parliament in the first reading with the end to strengthen and integrate paper of Cohesion Bottom inside the #european structural politics.

Gentleman President, *Señorías, sure enough, as *usted has mentioned, the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers had presented a resolution proposal but, to sight of the presented so much by the Group of the European Popular Party as by the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, do not have problem in *sumarnos to #the same, and #this is reason by the that have withdrawn the #ours.
negotiation on the *OMC, the world-wide trade, will be proof bank for *Europa, to see #if it will be able to condition the absolute primacy of the free exchange of commodities, today dominant, to protection needs of conditions of workers in the world, of the environmental and sanitary conditions of the populations of the world and of *Europa in particular.
Finally, since have time explained, wanted to simply *lanzarle a call saying that the Commission is not only the *ejecutante of the decisions of the Council or of the European Parliament and that now maybe have lost a bit taste by the discreet charm of norms with the lengths of elevator springs and that #would wish more initiatives of the Commission in relation with the problems of the civil society.
In effect, #if it reaches to carry to good term at the same time the extraordinary Summit of *Tampere, that *versará on security of citizens, the preparation of the *Europa of defence by means of integration of the *UEO in the European Union, the launching of a new round on enlargement in December and, finally, the application of the Stability Pact for the *sudeste of *Europa, the Presidency #finnish will have been a big Presidency of transition to the century *XXI.
Believe that, in front of seriousness of the subject, had been preferable to have a statement of President of the Commission, with seen to the document that expect of Mr. *Kinnock, on the institutional reform, expect to a report elaborated by the competent organ of this Assembly and pose, in moment, the position of Parliament on the future operation of the Commission.
Regarding transparency -already have said it, gentleman President- Group *le awards his full confidence, confidence that, obviously, depends of the results that *usted and his Commission will reach, confidence that depends of demonstration of the force of these great qualities moral and professional of each #one of Commissioners, on the *cuales go to watch with #all means and in #all forms, also in those better forms of transparency that *usted *nos has guaranteed.

#If well we underline the interesting movement initiated in relations among this institution and Parliament, #as well as our will to work in *pro of hit of the administrative reform announced, expressed the *convencimiento that, to answer to hopes *apremiantes of our *conciudadanos, #would have taken is missing to take the initiative of significant changes that affect no only to the operation of the Commission, but also to his own political orientations.
The proposals on help in the police and judicial collaboration in the penal questions, #as well as the distinct proposals on the creation of the juridical field European, conceal help and the back enlargement of the operative possibilities of the *Europol and of the national authorities putting in grave danger the fundamental democratic rights and the public freedoms.
But precisely these same feelings *solidarios to village #turkish, are the that demand that this catastrophe of the earthquakes was not considered like #one *coartada and that no unblock finance bottoms #if diet #turkish do not advances in fulfillment of conditions on respect of the human rights, of *Chipre and of the question *kurda, of way that show that, anyway, has the intention to give determined steps.
In *tercer place, finally, it is necessary to add, in the scientific field, the need to examine in detail and complete knowledges and scientific methods that we have for food production and *piensos safe; likewise, detection methods and the maximum of the different substances that contaminate foods, #as well as the *adecuación of the pertinent alimentary ingredients of different animal or vegetal waste or of recycling, as, for example, of oil recycling.
It same fits to say on the review of the financial perspectives that it is necessary also owing to help to *Kosovo, of repair of damages of the earthquakes of *Turquía and fishing agreements of *Marruecos, and is not *desligada of the fact that in category *IV no have in this moment sufficient money to make #all projects that the Council and the Commission want to carry out with proposals.
The evaluation put of relief that *SAVE is a valuable normative instrument to boost the energetic efficiency, but underlined that it was necessary a clear and coherent strategy for the experimental actions, that diffusion of the results is the key for hit on a long-term basis and that efficiency on a long-term basis requires to improve the permanent supervision and the analysis of the repercussions.
Of course, is precise that work together with organisations and thus had special care in giving account of work with Cross #Red, with the World-wide Program of Foods, with the *ACNUR and with organisations involved, for example, the WHO, precisely to achieve that it remained clear that #this is a humanitarian operation; without embargo, believe that it also is positive that the population and the #serbian political class see that the rest of the world also is prepared to help of form.
candidate statute and opening signals are well, always that have value to repeat first of all to *nosotros same that it will be difficult to receive to *Turquía in the European Union while Government #turkish follow ignoring the resolutions of the Security Council on the invasion of *Chipre, while I continued denying the existence of minority *kurda talking *genéricamente of terrorists, and while *Öcalan do not remain free of the threat of death pity.
*Le #would ask to President in exercise of the Council -since it do not has data on the reduction of tuna populations- #if has news on the failure of the *desovación of salmon during the last year in river of *Tornio, among *Finlandia and *Suecia, and #if President in exercise of the Council will call attention of the responsible Commissioner of fishing on the fact that fishing with networks of mesh to the derives #would have to be limited also in the *Báltico and no only in the zones mentioned of the #atlantic tuna.
work market, the initial training and the continuous training are key sectors for the active promotion of woman, and accompaniment measures, as for example attention of persons dependent, are very important precisely in the case of women and contribute to *facilitarles access to work market.
Also have problems with the categories, as for example in category 3, that includes the that have been traditionally the central points of politics: the environmental politics, training programs of youngsters, investigation, networks *transeuropeas, with opportunities for the creation of employment and the improvement of competitiveness to scale world-wide.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, wish first of all congratulate to the Presidency #finnish by hit that has been *Tampere when opening a new stage in development of the #european citizenship, attending to the always difficult balance among freedom and security, and *ello shows that no only are a Union based in freedoms for commodities, services and capitals, but also to answer to freedom of establishment and of trip of citizens and citizens.
reform, that #all know, in it deeper of *nosotros, that is necessary, is not only and neither in the first place question of time, is in the first place a question of political will, of lucidity on our own current operation and insufficiencies; is question of value, of collective value, that will have or will not have, to concede time the priority to the Union, to concede the priority to vision on a long-term basis, that surpasses -know it perfectly, although it was difficult- prudences and the immediate interests.
And #this because, in spite of the fine will of each #one and of colleagues - to those who *les give graces - this Institution has not found any solution to the situation of deputies no inscribed, a situation that is intolerable from the sight point administrative and financial and even more from sight point of the parliamentary prerogatives. In effect, do not have faculties neither of amendment neither of resolution.
Before beginning to expose the position of the relative Commission to the amendments approved by Parliament on 16 September, *permítanme take upsetting in that the Commission has tried to examine the suggestions of Parliament with spirit with the that am sure that the presented Parliament, to know, #which is the best way to make our collective effort European on terrain in *Kosovo and in #all the region.
In mood, cynicism of method "*Michelin" has had like consequence #one *decuplicación of rejection phenomenon that causes increasingly this modern capitalist strategy, the of *share-*holder *value, the creation of values for #shareholders, that consists in subordinating it all, and in the first place costs *insoportables, in his opinion, that represent work places, to the requirements *bulímicas of the financial shareholders of company.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0027\/1999) of Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of Transport Commission, Regional Politics and Tourism, on directive proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Directive 96\/49\/*CE on approximation of legislations of States members relative to the transport of dangerous commodities by railway [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0157<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0005<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1999<num>$/^0087<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>.
But helping of the best possible way to parts: to *Angola, on the one hand, and to States of the European Union and to the regions that fish, by #another, with control of Parliament and in accordance with the amendments that Fishing Commission has presented with regard to this important Agreement, that has, as it finishes to be reflected here, a remarkable political dimension, in addition to some economic and financial dimensions.
Believe that #if we do not tackle look of form production integrated, is to say, from moment in that they choose the matters prevail of car happening by the *manufactura of #the same, production process, the use and, finally, the recycled or final disposal of car *cuando no longer uses it buyer, do not go really to achieve take measures that are really significant in the field of the reduction of effect gases *invernadero.
Am totally in accordance with observations of Mr. *MacCormick on the situation of artists, that it #would be necessary to extend to #all the field of the intellectual creation, that finds with deficit inside the European Community, especially in matter of external competitiveness, and am also in accordance with observation on the need to guarantee the free circulation and the free exercise of the intellectual profession inside the European Community.
There #where the nuclear energy contributes to reach reduction goals of CO2 broadcasts, increase simultaneously our environmental problems by the nuclear waste and *eso goes against of the goals of the communication of the Commission here presented, that pleads by a more effective integration of the environment in the energetic politics.
Without embargo also believe that it exists contradiction that perhaps have to see in whole with decision fault that exists in the energetic politics inside the European Union *cuando *usted sees to dessert security in the cases mentioned in the closing -in it that coincide with *usted-, but *cuando treats of nuclear head offices *equiparables in States of the *CEI, wants to guarantee said security by means of modernisations and impulse of security measures by part of the European Union.
Thinks the European Commission keep commitment purchased by Commissioner Mr. *Brittan, in front of the Commission of External Subjects of the European Parliament, that of not fulfilling entirely the terms of the Agreement, the European Union #would go back to request the opening of signpost in front of instances of the World-wide Organisation of Trade?
As it put of self-evident in the historical meeting -is adjective that, aptly, has used the High Representative- that has celebrated this week the Council of General Subjects to the that assisted Defence ministers, States members believe that a greater cooperation in the field of security and defence in the European Union will contribute two main advantages.
In effect, of compliance with article 18 of the Treaty of the European Union, the European Commission has to take part fully in #all looks of the External Politics and of Common Security and Group proposes to defend, therefore, in moment the interests of the Commission, because #this are also the interests of the European Union, and by #this go to collect also collaboration in interest of *Europa, collaboration that *yo believe that personality of #both guarantees that it will be excellent.
And regarding paper of Parliament, believe that we have shown in these years help capacity and of accompaniment and understand that, from sight point of it that they #can and have to be dimension and development of defence and the common security of the Union, #can exert an important paper in relation with the rest of the world; believe that in occasion have to offer collaboration and #ours better attitude.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0056\/1999) of Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities, on the common position of the Council (9150\/1\/1999 - *C5-0181\/1999 - 1998\/0192(*COD)))with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves action program community (Program *DAPHNE) (2000-2003), on preventive measures allocated to combat violence exerted on boys, teenagers and women (Speaker: Mrs. *Avilés *Perea)

Precisely diffusion of death pity represents #one of the most intolerable rapes of the dignity and of the right to life of individual: rape that regret deeply and to the that we want to face up remembering, for example, that enlargement process of the Union is no only like peace factor and of security of the Continent, but also like path so that the countries candidates surpass said barbarism.
Wanted to respect roughly use time of the word, but in the frame of this debate suits to remember that we do not have to take in consideration only sight point #nordic, neither passion *desbordada of the *enamorados of the #austrian forests, but that go in in zone, in the centre of the EU, and also in *Alemania, concede a big importance to the liberalisation clauses, so as to that #all the approach follow being really feasible.
On #one of products, for putting an example, the of tuna loins, said study is levels of deficit of among 1.500 and 3.000 tonnes, is to say that, cheerfully and without data contrasted, the Commission was had to drown a community sector with thousands of places of work, #as well as his own systems of help to development to the countries *SPG-Drugs and *ACP by a need of inferior real import to 3.000 tonnes that #can cover perfectly with the current system of contingents *arancelarios.
Also foresees the Regulation that #if deputy elect abandoned Parliament before it approve in Plenary the present report, will examine vacancy and the provision of #the same, of compliance with article 8 of our internal Regulation and in accordance with disposals applicable of Record of 20 September 1976, in a separate procedure, independent of this report and that will take place in the timely moment.
since we consider to *Turquía like a fellow country, *nosotros wish that it achieve to build an authentic civil society, that achieve to concede a true identity to the *kurdos, as it splits ethnically differentiated of the population, obviously inside the #turkish state unit and in the frame of nation #turkish, and entrust in that the military power Turkish, that is #allied of Occident -and #this is in reality it tragic-, also take into account the *proporcionalidad of means in front of the problem *kurdo and, every time that they arise problems with the *kurdos, do not try *resolverlos by military means in place to resort to dialogue.
The European Council of Colony decided that it drafted a Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union before the European Council of December of 2000 and that the editorial ran to charge of organ composed of 15 representatives of State Bosses or of Government, 16 deputies to the European Parliament, included His *Señoría, 30 deputies to the national parliaments and *yo, in representation of President of the Commission.
Gentleman President, the budgetary discussion of this year has been so odd that, even among the speech of the general speaker, to the beginning of the debate, and my own intervention has *sucedido, by chronological order, it following: an informal meeting of Budget Commission, a meeting of the budgetary Council and a meeting of the political groups.
Fifteen members are five less of the that has the Commission, but in a relatively small institution as it is the Court of Accounts, any new enlargement will suppose a marked increase of weight of the cusp and a greater inertia, that already self-evident very *nítidamente in actuality in the excessive slowness of the necessary procedure until the Court of Accounts #make report.
The plan no *carecía of this requirement and, therefore, focus this debate on the base that export plan in base to the date did not demand the establishment of said terms #would induce to deception, because it #would be unfair for scientists that determined the necessary measures to guarantee that meat export of *vacuno #british no encloses danger, and also #would be unfair for the Commission in the approach that has adopted up to now.
do not believe that they estimate adequately neither that take seriously in consideration, at least to judge by the debates that have kept up to now -am new euro-deputy- the economic and social repercussions of the phenomenon of the illegal immigration, or, #if it wants, of the real immigration, even to *través of the legal procedure, by the parallel flow of illegal immigrants and the imminent pertinent flow of countries that will be community after enlargement of the European Union.
The third question treats of worry by #round-up, because it do not believes *usted that because of #round-up through States members of a same linguistic territory is very easy *torpedear the only price of books and that results little effective protect the special value of book like cultural object and the special meaning of the market of book for culture?
It that has reached in one hundred years in space *germanófono among *Austria, *Alemania and Swiss; it that has taken possible and guaranteed a big diversity; it that do not deletes in any case competition, but that has by consequence ensure supply to scale general by means of great and small bookshops in cities and in the field, #can not abandon to the *desenfrenada #blackmailer pressure of the strongest operators in the market, neither in business of bookshops, neither in the of sale by catalogue, neither in the electronic trade.
Parliament, the European Parliament, has the moral obligation to express solidarity with women #afghan, to request to the UN that take part more actively, to ask to States members that follow without recognising diet of the Talibans until #this access to respect the human rights and put end to discrimination of woman.
Subject: The euro and the speech of Mr. *Joschka *Fischer on 12 January 1999 In speech in front of the European Parliament, President of the Council said that the introduction of the euro supposes no only great changes but also an equal risk of great, for example, #if, like logical consequence of this audacious step, the EU did not give also equal steps of audacious to a total integration.
Second, investigation made by own initiative concerning the public access to the documents, supported by the parliamentary commission by pipe of the report of Mrs. *Thors and by the European Parliament, has taken that #all the institutions and the community organs interested have adopted norms on the public access to the documents, except in the case of the Court of Justice.
Regarding the governments of States members -that when seeming are not represented today- by pipe of representations in front of the European Union or collectively in the Council, cooperation with the Commission no #be *rebasar the minimum possible level and are not had to send civil servants to the parliamentary commission to argue with members about value of request.
Gentleman President, gentleman Defender of Village, as every year, discussion of the relative annual reports to activities of Request Commission and of Defender of Village *nos offers occasion to remember the importance that *revisten these two organisms in the establishment of bonds of confidence among the community institutions and citizens of States members.
Ask likewise that the European Parliament *erija in promoter of solidarity initiative, also economic, in favour of the inhabitants of *Apulia that no only have received and follow receiving generously to *decenas of thousands of #albanian and #kosovar refugees, but that pay *duramente the cost of war in terms of logistical difficulties with the closing of airports of the region and with damages *ocasionados to #all the tourist sector *pullés that suffers the cancellations of the that renounce to happen holidays in said region.
Like an important part of common effort, the Commission proposes to give the possibility to transport companies of the Community to use a maximum weight of vehicle of 44 tonnes, but exclusively *cuando transport by road referred to a specific part of transport combined and only in routes relatively short of the total distance of transport combined.
Have given #ours more cordial thanks to president of Regulation Commission, Mr. #Ben *Fayot, -and in point coincide fully with colleague, Mr. *Corbett- for having treated of way so fast and so cooperative the wish that manifested the Commission of Budgetary Control to Regulation Commission, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities.
Besides have to *decirles, *Señorías, that the economic orientations here presented only follow betting by saving politics even more strict for States members, with the idea that it #can create employment with flexible wages, with deregulation of the labour market and with the dismantlement of the social protection, and *eso is not exactly my idea of a #european strategy for employment.
This vote, with the that deputies exert condition of representatives of the #european citizens without any *condicionamiento of the national Governments, goes to be decided in the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left\/Nordic Green Left in accordance with commitments that purchases candidate in his political orientations generals and in a clear program of reforms of the own Commission.
Gentleman President, so much in the statement of President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, of the past month as in the of today, have valued commitment to make the necessary reforms to renew and reinforce the European Institutions, and especially commitment of an increasingly transparent Commission, school and effective, #as well as the of a greater paper of Parliament and of enlargement of the vote by majority of the Council.
In modification proposal, the Commission inserts, in article 28 of the directive, section 6 new, by the that introduces permission procedure so that the Council resolve by unanimity to proposal of the Commission, allowing that States members that wish it apply a type reduced to determined local services with big intensity of hand of drama and that fulfil precise requirements, during the period comprised among 1 January 2000 and on 31 December 2002.
Gentleman President, the great orientations of the economic politics for the next year are dominated by an unexpected shadow to the eyes of the official experts: #one *desaceleración of growth in *Europa of roughly the 2 %, joined to the maintenance of unemployment tax elevated, of roughly the 10 % in the whole of *Europa, whereas States Joined register growth of more of the double and unemployment of two times lower.
But the Environment Commission has accepted a series of proposals with the intention to intensify seriously the protection of consumer. Without embargo, am convinced that with a minimum directive, retractation right of 30 days, delivery during negotiations of a complete agreement complicated *jurídicamente and summary, did not achieves the goal that pretends.
In the big debate that today *nos occupies on the minimum and maximum harmonisation, the that defend, as it takes it the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer, the minimum harmonisation, take it no because they wish to put *coto to Internet demands, but because they do not want to see diminish the protection to consumer of significant way in each Been member in it individual, it that it #can *suceder, had explains information level provided in the managerial #such as it is.
Is hit that today #can it debate, since with this regulation will take an important contribution for the protection of the environment, but also facilitates commercialisation of tractors inside the European Community #as well as also the access of #european manufacturers to the market of third countries through equivalence created among the community legislation and the regulation of the *EC-UN *nº 96.
serenity, capacity to mediate among differences and opposite points *nos have impressed really of deep mood and personally have learnt to know in *usted beside sense of impartiality also understanding by the increasing tasks of this Assembly, as this Assembly has grown in term of office period at least head.
Consider that, in a context of budgetary austerity, the Council and the Commission have had the good sense to concentrate helps in the Objective regions 1, it that goes to allow that, in terms of help *per *cápita , keep the current levels of support and that, besides, keep Cohesion Bottom, collaborating to accelerate recovery of the structural dynamics in the less prosperous States.
Suffices with saying that, like result of the debates that have taken place during the #austrian and #german presidencies -the last of the *cuales has carried out great and *loables efforts to be able to get to an agreement with the Council before finals of June-, and thanks to the remarkable parliamentary contribution by means of the resolution of the past September and, now, of the report of Mrs. *Aglietta, #everything seems to indicate -like this expect it- that we have got to the final stage of negotiations.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate on the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To4-0155\/99) of Mr. *Pronk, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on directive proposal of the relative Council to the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of health and of security of workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres (13836\/4\/98 - *C4-0003\/99-95\/0235(*SYN)).
Once again, the Group of Independent by the *Europa of Nations reiterates wish that the European Union allocate efforts to the existent common politics (*PAC, *PCP...), in place to disperse among some fields always more numerous, to risk of aggravating the dissemination, necessarily ineffective, of the public bottoms and to boost inflation, always *perniciosa, of the public cost.
In look, the European Union has expressed conviction that the creation of a #palestinian State sovereign, democratic, viable and peaceful, on the base of the existent agreements and by road of negotiation #would be the best guarantee of security for #Israel and of regional acceptance, by it that has declared had to consider in moment recognition of a #palestinian State.
commitment fault with the basic principle of no discrimination, character limited of the field of relative application to persons and to the objects and the definition little *convincente of the obligations are sufficient reasons to ask how the European Parliament #can *erigirse in front of the affected like *garante of minimum norms and minimum commitments *cuando the representatives of interests do not know to negotiate.
Gentleman President, *me *congratulo that my last intervention of this term of office refer to an important sector: the textile industry and of the #european preparation, industry that employs generally hand of feminine drama, industry pertaining to the frame of #SME that often covers the rural zones, industry, finally, #whose future depends closely of the application of commercial norms *equitativas.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, *Señorías, of course the Presidency #german of the Council has seen *eclipsada by war of *Kosovo. Thus, it is necessary to ascertain that the position of the Presidency, of the that it is responsible the Federal Government German in this question, only has been able to keep because it has been supported without reservations by the parties of the Union whereas *usted, estimated colleague *Fischer, #would have left abandoned *gustosamente to his own followers in sport shoes #if it is that still the carry.
For *reconquistar said confidence have to act with decision, without embargo, will reach it only #if we confront those problems that have an authentic importance in the daily life of citizens as, for example, employment, the economic growth and the challenge of the sustainable development to ensure the balance among the creation of wealth, the social justice and quality of life.
Here yes, gentleman President, #would take lacking flexibility, no of work market, but of the Stability Pact, to reach perhaps suspension and, anyway, to be able to consider out of *él investments of growth and to be able to propose expansion politics of quality, things without the *cuales no exists possibility #any neither of *paliar the democratic deficit neither to reduce distrust that the #european populations have to his current Institutions.
As well, #if *usted considers that, in these conditions, *Pristina constitutes an ideal place to install direction centre, a central administration of program for the group the *Balcanes, no only for *Kosovo, then *me fear that observations are not sincere, observations are loaded of political intention, and *me ask how a Commission that *carece already of political mandate and #whose credibility is in *entredicho, especially as a result of the case *Bangermann, *atreve to adopt position and rush forward against the decisions of the Council of Ministers.
Gentleman President, is a pity that in the first intervention that *me allows to make as new deputy have to talk of some grave errors committed in my country, in the first place in companies that supply the matter prevails of the *piensos for animals, afterwards in control services commissioned to discover any failure that produce and to limit consequences; also, and especially, in the Administration of #that then that was time during weeks and that *nos has prejudiced enormously by not communicating to time to the European Commission and to States members it that was.
And *yo wanted to, through *usted, ask to the European Parliament that, in the first place, support efforts of #all the political strengths for *propiciar dialogue among #all the political representatives; second, that Parliament request *encarecidamente to ETA the definite abandonment of violence, and, in *tercer and last place, that also #can agree programs to help to the victims, to the *reinserción of prisoners and by education for peace in the Basque Country and in *Irlanda of the North.
Have despised the capacity of Parliament to exert of autonomous way competitions that *le attribute the Treaties, with the result of the current situation: the impression, in the public opinion, that we #can not *pronunciarnos on the future Commission without a report that, by very important that was and by very expert that they are authors, is not determinant for our political decision.
A complex organism like the European Union #can not dispense of the continuous relation with inhabitants, final addressees of #all decisions and political; without embargo, unification process #can not advance without backrest conscious of citizens, without the disappearance of unemployment and the creation of a new economic development.
Gentleman *Prodi, the Group of Environmentalists *le has suggested to modify wallet cast in breast of squad because, in addition to the integrity and competitions of commissioner, consider that his personal commitment and determination to defend the matters that *les have entrusted in the perspective of #one *Europa federal are also an element of important assessment.
In the first place, commitment to gather what before with members of the commission to conceive a new program of social action that cover #all the mandate of the new Commission and recognise the realities of the new world that has brought achieve the euro and the new possibilities that give off of the Treaty of *Amsterdam to boost employment and the opportunities and struggle against insecurity and exclusion.
Gentleman *Prodi, estimated candidates to Commissioners, enlargement, the external politics and of security, the strengthening of the free trade in the world, the opening of new markets, the continuation of liberalism in *Europa with a greater competitiveness for our common coin and a forceful environmental politics, are subjects for the that *Europa goes to need a strong Commission and that work well in the that *usted, professor *Prodi, goes to have confidence and approval for squad.
The European Parliament, by part, loans to the game with *delectación, since the text presented to vote titles "Project of decision on the election of the Commission designated", *cuando, in reality, results more that evident that no treats of an election neither in level of our Assembly, in the that of it that treats *jurídicamente is of the approval of the designation of Commissioners, neither to *fortiori in level of the constituents that, at least in *Francia, and surely in #many countries never have heard to talk of Mr. *Prodi.
In wait of an indispensable *reorientación of the political axes of the Commission and a debate on the future action, has to interpret the positive vote of today like the option in *pro of not multiplying the crisis, the blockades, in our institutions, like the refusal to look for individual piacular goats *cuando it that is in *entredicho is the political orientation and the model of civilisation of *Europa.
Therefore, is necessary a firm political will to end to support the following steps of the international community so that no have #indonesian conditions in relation with intervention of strengths and so that, was *cual was conflict grade in the territory, #can guarantee peace and security to the *timorenses and the humanitarian support and development that *Timor so much needs.
Also want to take part actively in the corresponding negotiations and *asegurarnos that the instruments of the Union are in concordance with the future Convention. With this end, the last Presidencies of the Union, after the request presented by the Council in October of 1998, have conciliated positions regarding the fight against delinquency organised in the meetings in *Bruselas of mixed commissions and of the Committee *K.4, the *cual works in fulfillment of article 36, #as well as in negotiations that celebrate in *Viena.
Among dispatch and services of Parliament has glided *algún error and #would want to say, to facilitate things to President in exercise, that the question is the following: whereas citizens of States Joined go in freely in #all the countries of the European Union, citizens of determined countries of the European Union need visa of the North American embassy to go to States Joined.
Subject: Construction of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos Has knowledge the Council of construction project of a nuclear head office in the south of *Marruecos for *desalinizar waters of the sea and, in case, #can consider argue with the alternative #moroccan government to project, in view of his eventual environmental effect and of the dangers for security of the zone?
To begin, *permítame express the gratitude of the Commission by the thorough report of Development Commission and Cooperation and by support received during query procedure to efforts of face Commission to the celebration of the *Décimo Agreement among the Community and Organism of public dramas and aid of Nations Joined for Palestinian refugees in Orient Half.
By reasons, receive with *beneplácito commitment of Commissioner *Byrne to concede the maximum priority to the *inocuidad of foods and also the statement that took President of the Commission, Roman *Prodi, in this Assembly on 23 July, *cuando said that #one of the first tasks of his Commission #would be the to restore confidence of consumers in security of the alimentary products.
In this context, two have to be, to trial, the immediate goals of this Assembly: take operative the parliamentary structures of the forum *euromediterráneo in understanding that it #can mean an useful instrument to ensure peace, and translate to practice the initiative of Speaker of Parliament, Mrs. *Fontaine, to make #one turns by the region.
Now well, States Joined are *signatarios of the International Agreement of Civil Rights and Politicians, of the Agreement against the Racial Discrimination, #as well as of the Agreement against Torture, that applies in the case of *Moumia, since the racial factor weighed a lot in process, and the seventeen years that has happened in runner of death constitute, according to these treaties, an unfair punishment, equivalent to torture.
Gentleman President, costs pity stand out that we are at the end of a period of five centuries during the *cual the only way to authenticate documents and transactions was the signature written or the signature certified, etc. Now, in less time that half of life of person, go in in a world that goes to be dominated by the electronic trade, by new technologies and by signatures that no exist in the ancient meaning of the word and that, therefore, it will be necessary to authenticate of an unpublished way.
The most important has been that this year have had to live experience of war in #european territory, war caused by the gravest rapes of the human rights and by expulsion politics of population and ethnic cleansing carried out by diet of *Milosevic; a political that #one *Europa democratic and a democratic community of nations, engaged with defence of the human rights, #can not tolerate.
In this context *yo also wanted to highlight, nevertheless, that no only treats to begin to give answer to the priorities in the field of the external politics, as for example reconstruction of *Kosovo, but that to be able to *organizarlas and *impulsarlas of reasonable way is precise that the Council also approximate to the position of Parliament regarding the organisation of help and to the operation of the future agency for reconstruction of *Kosovo.
Without embargo, *me disappoints that they are reductions in the global budgetary endowment, but expect that the European Council, *cuando get moment to review the *segunda reading of the budget of the EU for the year 2000, take into account the recommendation of Parliament to increase finance of program until 67 millions of euros or 53 millions of pounds #irish in assignment of the next year.
Given commitment collected in the Treaty of *Amsterdam to incorporate the interests of consumers to #all the areas of performance of the EU and level *irrisorio of the budget for politics of consumers, that situates in a 0,25% of the total of cost of the EU, is necessary to begin by *asegurarnos that they keep valuable programs like distribution plan of milk in schools.
Has to treat of misunderstanding because it that the Federal Reservation publishes two times to the year in report *Humphrey *Hawkins for the Senate is a series of figures for #one those that indicators constituting the series the individual forecasts of members of the Federal Committee of the Open Market, *provenientes of the regional banks of the Federal Reservation.
Is an integral strategy and unified oriented to strengthen the fundamental subjects of the country like research of peace, reflation of our economy and employment generation, the protection of the human rights, the strengthening of justice and the increase of the social participation.
#If the package is wider, #can result easier reach an agreement and easier ratification in States members, but in name of my Group #can affirm that we are had to that Parliament collaborate closely with the Commission in the spirit that finishes to indicate Mr. *Barnier, so that together #can put on the table of the *CIG a package balanced of proposals that *él and representatives in #all the meetings of the *CIG #can defend: a package that prepare to the Union so that it work *cuando have more of 20 States members.
(Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98\/4 relative to the maximum limits of broadcast and poured to chloride production of vinyl *monomérico, and the Decision *OSPAR 98\/5 relative to the maximum limits of broadcast and poured in the sector of vinyl chloride (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0016\/1999 - 1999\/0098(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of Consumer)
By it other, *Señorías, this new and grave case, that has impressed in *Francia to the media and to the political world, sample, #if it still was necessary, the urgency of measures firm and pertinent in *Europa to conciliate the economic performance and the social guarantees, growth and employment, freedom of company and defence of wages.
#If now the Commission do not uses #all the necessary energy to protect this *pilar fundamental of the common politics of fishing, as they are the agreements *pesqueros, then pressure of professionals of the sector #would be important and founded, to end to demand the *cuestionamiento of politics *pesquera common and the *restablecimiento of a bilateral frame, that allow the direct celebration of agreements of fishing among States members and third countries, that #would respect and #would defend better the vital interests of villages.
#There is an agreement reached among the two parts of industry of the maritime sector, there #be a specific proposal relative to persons of the sea that take scale in ports of the Community, but also there #be an Agreement of the *OIT, the *nº 180, and, in fact, the agreement among the two parts of industry of the maritime sector based in very big measure in the Agreement 180 of the *OIT.
Sure that it is not a fully satisfactory solution for doctors, but in this subject so complex have to take into account politics of States members on the systems of national health, on the reality of country, on the period in the that doctors are in training and that it is a transitory period and like this try find, with realism, an intermediate solution that *nos allow, finally, step but.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0048\/1999) of Mrs. *Quisthoudt-*Rowohl, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the relative Council to the conclusion of Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Russian Federation [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0324<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0083<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1999<num>$/^0133<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>
amplitude of discussion and the varied suggestions that produced in breast of Employment Commission and Social Subjects and that referred of way very general to employment politics *me moved to make in project of my report division in conclusions, on the one hand, and in a legislative part, by #another, the *cual concentrates in the proposals for the guidelines of the year 2000 that they have to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in December of 1999.
*Me seems insufficient coordination among the labour politics, of employment, of government of work market and politics that *inciden in the structural factors and in the frame *macroeconómico; *me seems insufficient structuring level, of investment in effective community Institutions and able to govern these processes for the *cuales no only is sufficient respect to competitions and to the prerogatives of the national states.
And since they have listened interventions and proposals of his *señorías on paper of the Commission in the institutionalisation of goals for action more resolved, want to stress that the #european strategy for employment happens by support and impulse of the national politics and in this frame try to keep the narrowest collaboration possible with States members.
Gentleman President, have to say that it manifested by Mr. *Vattimo do not corresponds to the reality because Speaker of Parliament limited to mention *cual was the vote in Plenary on a resolution of the European Parliament that invited to #all States members to respect commitment of parity of the educational system, or was, to facilitate parity of the educational system.
Regarding the question of the permeability among these two categories, *me allow to call attention on the fact that we will debate on how #can *reagrupar credits that in the agricultural sector -and here in categories 1To and regulation measures of market that did not employ because of the evolution of prices and of the market and that then #can be available for measures- in the frame of the debate on the next report.
In my opinion, only the EU is able to take it, needing an active strategy that, by part, take upsetting in efforts in the community field and in the active cooperation, especially with the countries in development, *ayudándoles so that his energetic systems are more ecological and, by #another, show that in fact it #can change of course without great costs, since they are #many the environmental benefits that obtain when limiting dependency of fossils.
The Commission follows very concerned by that it do not have had tangible advances up to now by part of States Joined in commitment with seen to the modification by Congress of the Title 4 of the law *Helms-*Burton, especially because the Government of States Joined has remembered periodically that, of not taking modification, President is forced to impose the application of the Title 4.
Cover, among things, compensation, the psychological treatment and doctor, assistance to the victims for the collection of debts, transmission of the decisions of a Been member to #another to improve the protection of the victims or ask to the courts that accept testimonies written of the victims that #can not assist to the seen of the courts against aggressors for living in another Been member.
Besides, the Council has communicated that is had to support, using #all means near at hand of the European Union and of States members, development of sources of electrical energy to substitute to the nuclear head offices little reliable, taking into account, to time, the global situation and characteristics and own needs of country.
My question to the Council is the following: had account of this terrible precedent, is had the Council to consider the possibility of *presionar to the authorities of *Myanmar so that they declare a total amnesty for this type of political prisoners and, in this same sense, has treated in #any occasion the Council on the possibility to impose economic sanctions to *Myanmar until it adopt a political more humanitarian?
. (*FR) The cycle of #Millenium, that will initiate *próximamente in breast of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the *OMC, has to be occasion, for *Europa -place that *nos has imposed condition of having to talk with an alone voice-, to show no only joined during the course of negotiations, but also show the greater firmness regarding the results, specifically regarding agriculture and to the cultural exception.
It true is that this goal appears around questions so notable like the alimentary security, the public services or the "intellectual property", always in favour of a blind liberalisation of the financial capital and without respecting the labour norms of the *OIT and the environmental norms internationally approved and with consequences *nefastas for the cultural identity of villages and the own development of *decenas of countries, in particular of the poorest.
No fits the lower doubt that difficulties are still #many, already was in the sphere of the humanitarian help or in the of support to reconstruction or even because they follow producing grave rapes of the human rights, especially in the western part of *Timor, with activity of militias, that have prevented the *reagrupamiento and the return of refugees of *Timor Oriental to houses and to earths.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the continuation of the debate of the report (To5-0063\/1999) of Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, of Justice and of Inner Subjects, on the communication of the European Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on an action plan of the European Union in matter of fight against drug (2000-2004) (*COM(1999)239).
say It also in name of mate absent #Jan *Andersson, the one who - now will go back on *ello -, in what deputy #swedish, was in an especially difficult situation because *Suecia is #one of States members that has a very special approach in politics of resultant drugs of experience and of his national tradition and, without embargo, create, has procured, precisely in transaction amendments, Mrs. Deputy, get to a wide agreement with *usted in the final editorial of this report.
Believe that the words of Mr. *Medina *Ortega have been *clarificadoras regarding the approach and to posture -to the that it has got by unanimity in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market- with regard to a transcendental subject, an important subject for the Canarian islands, but that has a reflection on the rest of regions *ultraperiféricas of the European Union.
knows that country has *subscrito agreements to inferior price to the real cost of production benefiting of the international supports, by mediation of the International Monetary Bottom, after the #asian crisis, it that is request wallets of the countries of the European Union, as they have manifested the business organisations of the sector.
Finally, wish *referirme, because I proceed also of a peripheral region, to the enormous impact in the regional development that has the naval industry, *asentada in #many of these regions, in big part included also in the Goal *nº 1 of the #european regional politics, with *importantísimos dockyards generators of employments direct and indirect, a social balance of the that so needed are the countries of cohesion, that demand the #european solidarity.
works initiated in *Tampere with seen to the preparation of a Letter of fundamental rights and the possible reform of the Treaty to separate the fundamental and essential acts of application disposals: in this way, #would convert in more comprehensible the essential acts and #would speed up modification procedure of the less essential acts.
Believe that Parliament do not has to conform with asking take part in works of the Conference, #as well as in the of the preparation of the Letter of fundamental rights, but that it has to pretend act like a true Parliament and pretend likewise that, with occasion of the Conference *Intergubernamental, *le return the right to decide *autónomamente place of meeting not to be forced to work with Secretariat in three different forums.
Finally, wanted to remember that, #if disposals relative to the group of the planned helps, comport finance in three years of 150 millions of euros, the balance in favour of the Union of the commercial scales among *Turquía and the European Union duplicated from the entrance in vigour onº 1 January 1996 of the agreement on the Union *Aduanera and in four years happened of four one thousand millions to eight one thousand millions of euros.
The monetary politics do not goes to be in conditions to reinforce the credibility of the #european integration in favour of growth, of employment and even of investment, #if to time that in the unification and centralisation of the monetary politics States members of the European Union do not put of agreement also in the signals against the *dumping public prosecutor, against the *dumping social and in favour of a greater employment.
. (*FR) In spite of his very limited character and clearly insufficient in attention to the problem treated, *nosotros will vote positively directive relative to "the minimum disposals for the improvement of the protection of health and security of workers exposed to the risks derived of explosive atmospheres", in measure in that it #can represent progress in the countries in that workers are less protected.
Also in relation with the day of Monday, is to say, today, concerning the recommendation for the *segunda reading on substances that exhaust ozone coat and the resolution proposal on labeling of edible produced from organisms genetically modified, the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer asks that they displace these two points, in view of that examination in Plenary #would coincide with the meeting of the Commission, it that #would not be practical precisely.
negotiations have to restart in the field of the World-wide Organisation of Trade and *Europa has to be fully conscious of paper, balance paper and responsibility, with regard to globalisation with human face, open and available to changes and to the accelerations of the economy, but also able to protect the right to work and to defence of the environment and of health.
Believe that *ustedes have put in clear that the European Union is in conditions no only to assume paper leader in the frame of negotiation round and also in the frame of the next world-wide round, that do not take part here like players of *póker to impose our interests but that also are had to receive on board to the nations, especially to nations in roads of development and to the less developed countries.
Parliament wished to go further of it that proposes the Council in the fight against the juvenile unemployment and of long length, especially by means of integration on a long-term basis in work market through an intensification of the active measures in front of the passive, or was, increasing the proportion of unemployed that receive initial professional training and of improvement or of professional reconversion, as the fault of places of work is only face of coin.
Since it listens and reads with frequency that the responsible networks of traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of transport of material in question makes by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
Taking into account the existent bonds among the Council *ECOFIN and the Council of Governors of the *BEI, #can indicate the Council #if it thinks to take measures to take more transparent and accessible information relative to the decisions of the *BEI, in particular *cuando these decisions have important repercussions in development of a region, and #if it do not considers that it is necessary to improve efficiency of activities of the *BEI introducing procedures of management and financial accounting in the that they take fully in consideration to the costs related with the environment?
Subject: 50 anniversary of Gin Agreements In the context of the 50 anniversary of Gin Agreements, and to sight of conflicts armed that they have developed in the world in the last years, especially the that have had like stage the #european continent, how reflection #can take the Council on fulfillment state of the humanitarian International Right that contain the mentioned agreements of Gin?
Gentleman President, the Council *le remembers to Mr. deputy to Parliament that the Council adopted the Directive 91\/628\/*CEE, that remained modified by the Directive 95\/29\/*CE, on the protection of animals alive during transport, by means of the *cual remained ratified rule applicable to animal transport in #all the territory of the EU, included norms on the maximum time of transport for different animal species.
Since it listens and reads with frequency that the responsible networks of traffic in question have his main bases in *Ucrania, the Czech Republic and *Rusia, that cities of *Estambul and *Budapest constitute the most important centres of said traffic and that big part of transport of material in question makes by routes that cross the *Balcanes, #many of the *cuales cross *Kosovo, #which is posture of the Commission in this grave question and how the confront countries in #whose territory takes place this dangerous illegal traffic?
The Council has not agreed that it produce postponement of a year, but that has given by fine a conclusion that is of the following tenor: #if Parliament accepts amendment to this report, that treats of labeling, and do not leaves to happen the proposal of the Commission without presenting amendments, the Council, then, will not accept this modification and will not follow the procedure simplified.
Subject: The insular regions in the new context of the Treaty of *Amsterdam article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam establishes that the Community will propose to reduce delay of the less favoured regions or insular and the statement *nº 30 *aneja to the Treaty recognises that «the insular regions suffer of structural disadvantages linked to his insular character #whose permanence prejudices to his economic and social development».
*Me seems, in this sense, important #emphasize the importance of acceptance by part of *Praga of the principles in the that is based the external politics and of common security and that, even, have been the Government of the Czech Republic the one who have taken the initiative to reinforce the political cooperation among the countries candidates to adhesion to the European Union.
In the current proposal, the Commission presents it following: integration in a budgetary line of #all activities in the field of customs, training of civil servants and computer projects. The creation of representative committee of States members has to conduct to a greater implication of States members in program and, as *tercer point, the opening of program to the countries associated.
From sight point of the industrial development there are responsibilities, also of the #italian Government: development of the petrochemical company of Carry *Marghera has revealed, definitely, *desestabilizador for the delicate balances of lagoon, without embargo, #if we want to #one *Europa -as it said President commissioned Mr. *Prodi- that head the new business initiatives, obligation is to reach that these new business initiatives have in #Venecia #one of his main centres propellants.
#All know that in numerous occasions Parliament has shown favourable to the introduction of a #european tax, and in this case, *socarronamente, when declaring in favour of a text that allows to States members reduce taxes, tries to modify the juridical foundation of the Treaties modifying approval procedure of the fiscal proposals of the Commission in breast of the Council.
From Colony has to split a signal in this direction; has to take a decision that give start to the political union; has to remain patent the will to follow this path and has to remain clear that the European Union has the intention of *erigirse in subject active in the international relations and in the eventual crises, because has the purpose to endow of #all the necessary instruments, indispensable and apt to guarantee sovereignty and autonomy.
With regard to the financial system: the European Council has recognised the existence of budgetary disequilibriums in finance of the Union and has foreseen modifications in the system of own resources existent that have more in account the financial capacity of States members establishing like this a greater justice in the contributions.
In this frame and, #if well *nos #would enjoy to support and *incentivar unconditionally the new agreement *interinstitucional by reasons of principle and to guarantee stability and allow planning, is not less true that commitment that comports regarding the financial frame approved with the quoted characteristic *nos arouses #some reservations, that increase more by the absence of a deep reform of the *PAC, that advocate, or also by tenor *innegablemente limiting of norms that will regulate #some of the instruments related with cohesion, but on looks will pronounce members of my Group.
Go to conclude my intervention, gentleman President, but did not want to *acabarla without taking attention call on a fact that *me seems important: modernisation of the fleet *pesquera is certainly important, the structural intervention is of big importance, but development of fishing, for fleet, depends to a large extent of the existence of international agreements with third countries that allow to find *caladeros in the *cuales fish and develop performance of this fleet.
In particular, has not modified neither article 4 of the Treaty of the European Union, that converts to the Council (and, therefore, to the hierarchy of the different Councils) in the centre from #where promote politics of the Union, neither article 202 of the Treaty *CE, that entrusts only to the Council the committed to determine execution competitions that will confer to the Commission.
After having taken *alarde during the #german electoral campaign that with the rise to power of the socialists #would change all and #would begin path *modélico that #would create places of work, investing the negative tendency that lives *Europa from takes at least a decade, did not take initiative #any in this direction and neither debated any proposal in favour of development of the #european economy.
First of all wanted to say to #all colleagues that in January and February *opusieron to the motion that created the Committee of Independent Experts thinking that it treated of hit species of hand to sink it #everything through the creation of a committee, that think that now they give account that *equivocaron of plane so much of point of sight as of reasoning, and that, at least, #would have to withdraw #all criticisms that took then to dynamics undertaken, *me seems that positively, by the European Parliament, by #that that voted in favour of the creation of the Committee of Independent Experts.
In the European Union that day to day develops more relations with third countries; politics that, as #all comprise, is connected with #some looks of chapter on justice, security and freedom in *Europa, as, for example, look of immigration and asylum. The Council of *Tampere is called also, *señorías, to confront the questions of freedom, security and justice for citizens in relation with the new realities that result of the new challenges that compose the step of the century *XX to the century *XXI.
Also is true that experiences of the past have carried to Parliament to *desconfiar and to suspect that the reallocations of pertinent resources of budgetary lines no exhausted in bottom are practice *premeditada, since the budget always includes priorities of Parliament that do not enjoy of popularity and that the institutions are not had to apply unconditionally.
The "#european letter of the fundamental rights" , that supposes has to elaborate the European Council of *Tampere, will not be more that a group of hollow words #if it do not contains like minimum the total freedom of circulation and of installation for #all #that that reside and work in the European Union, #any one was nationality of origin, #as well as the complete equality of rights, included the right of vote.
Believe that, in the first place, recommends aptly the foundation of organisation, but that do not has to limit to investigation of the seismic phenomenons and to prevention of the earthquakes, that until moment is scientifically impossible, #such as they ensure the *sismólogos, and #this #would have to know it colleagues, that propose the creation of an institute for earthquake prevention, but that it will have to indicate regulations and specifications of constructions *antisísmicas, of materials of construction adapted, etc., and will have to contribute to the best information of the #european citizens, loomed by the diverse calamities #as well as to that comport adequately in #this.
But believe that #all have to recognise, gentleman President, that have had five years of prolonged and tortuous negotiations on product class: from apples, pears and asparagus until flowers, fish, wine, port and sherry, but now see that in moment will have an agreement and is to expect that the firm Monday in *Sudáfrica.
Therefore I approve the amendments presented by Mr. *Langen, to demand that the Commission exert a more active paper to end to boost promotion strategy coordinated in breast of States members and to develop the potential of *Europa in the field of export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
#If it do not wishes to engage in road, will correspond then to Parliament go back to the strict application of the Treaty, article 272, and give means - *algo that it #can take - so much in the field of commitments as of payments, to vote credits to the height of commitments that are the political commitments of the European Union and in the strict respect by the Treaty.
The *ECON also considers that it is an absolute priority the finance of measures on taxation, because this sector follows being a field of irregularities in the inner market and, therefore, line *B5-3001 on the application and the evolution of the inner market will have to keep in level that has proposed the Commission in project.
To my seem, in the decision of Thursday happened also influenced descent already registered and the *ulteriores reductions that expect in prices for consumer in the sectors of telecommunications, electricity and the financial services, like result of competition and liberalisation of the markets, to the equal that the fall of prices of oil.
To part of the fact -and #this #can be *algo embarrassing- that virtually, in Government Council, never vote, so that it never #there is at all that publish, do not go to repeat #all the arguments against of #this, the *cuales already have presented to Parliament in previous occasions, but it is necessary to remember that the decisions of Government Council of the system of the Euro adopt of collegiate form and therefore only it arises an only decision.
For *ello have set up a wide politics of State to struggle inside the frame of the law against the groups armed to the *margen of #this; to guarantee security, protection, support and freedom of action for defenders of the human rights; to attend to persons displaced by violence; to adopt the legal instruments that protect the human rights and strengthen our device of justice.
point has been the adoption of concrete measures in relation to the fight against crime organised, as, for example, a greater operative competition for the *Europol, an Academy of European Police or measures more strict against money wash and cooperation with the countries candidates, as with frequency are the countries origin of crime organised.
*Segunda contradiction: the Council of *Tampere announces the platonic will to administer the migratory currents and struggle against immigration *clandestina in the origin, but to time proclaims firmly, in varied occasions, that it is necessary to concede to the legal immigrants -quote- "a group of uniform rights so next as it was possible to the of citizens of the Union" and that has to apply *prioritariamente integration politics that *les allow to remain.
Already is more that hour to act in level of the Council and of the Commission and -*me *atrevo to say it like conclusion of my intervention- of *ello depends, of course, coherence of societies, the social peace, the own survival of the #european idea, but also interest very understood of company in his *globalidad and, therefore, the solidity of the #european economy.
In the last years, included the #spanish democratic stage, have known varied situations #where fishing always has been subject pending among parts by the subject of the existent dispute to hour to define our territorial waters in relation to the neighbouring villages #african.
Memory that, with occasion of negotiation of fishing Agreement that now expires, Left Group Unitary European *opuso to that got to the signature of the Agreement *pesquero by means of the granting of additional contingents for fruit import and vegetables in the frame of the parallel negotiation of the association Agreement.
On the one hand, there #be the need of *sustanciar the same existence of the European Union converting in effective in #all States members the application of the decisions taken in the competent instances in the matters of community competition and, in particular, in the cases like the tackled, susceptible of invalidating #one of the fundamental suppositions of the Union, is to say, the free circulation of commodities.
Goals that, in accordance with the strategy of the great orientations of economic politics, are not thing that achieve facilitate the stability goal of the monetary politics by means of some budgetary measures and an evolution *salarial suitable and more favourable, in conditions, to growth and to employment, included the types of change and interest types on a long-term basis.

Gentleman President, *me seems that the #many things that have said #can schematise of the following mood: or dialogue *macroeconómico is a pure hypocrisy for *paliar the fault of a true economic politics for the Union, and then it that said the colleagues is totally useless, calque and a loss of time; or well dialogue *macroeconómico is *algo true, substantial, and then there #be hypocrisy by the #another side, is to say, tries to hide with words *insustanciales a danger that, in my opinion, evolves to the *dirigismo in the #european economy.
Certainly is to appreciate that it recognise the fundamental paper of school to win unemployment, without embargo, lacking any reference to the need that school act in the field of a global territorial planning that see the participation of the social speakers, the local entities and the business world.
Wish, in particular, take #some observations on reasons that *me have carried to vote in favour of the strategy for the inner market, but before taking it, *permítanme say also that have voted against in the question of procedure to postpone the vote on the subject of fishing, because *me will be of the all impossible assist to *Estrasburgo inside two weeks and #would have wished enormously express solidarity with fishermen to part of *Escocia, in particular, with #that of the islands and zones separated.
The European Parliament and the Council buy to very low price consciousness tranquility, because in addition to the private violence and of the relative to the sexual exploitation, it is necessary to recognise the increase of the social violence, that results of the aggravation of poverty and of the intensification of misfortune in the popular classes.
The insistence in the need to influence on the reflections of the population and consumption habits and to establish currents of communication with citizens and small and medium enterprises confirms the importance that will have the political leadership on change of consumption habits and the promotion of a sustainable development.
The resolution of Parliament *nos remembers to #all the external dimension, #this is, the enlargement process and relations with third countries, especially with the countries in roads of development; *nos invites to adopt a realistic approach, balanced and flexible in the preparation of politics, look especially important to hour to examine the energetic combination and evolution in time.
And, finally, in relation with the amendment *nº 19, comprise the sense of the proposal, but signal to attention of His *Señorías that norm relative to translation of the decisions no fits in a regulation on competition, recognition and execution of judicial decisions: the own place for norm on translations is the directive on transmission of acts, the #another instrument that today debate and in the that it establishes precisely translation possibility.
In speaker quality of opinion of the Commission of External Subjects for the report on actions in the nuclear sector in favour of the *PECOS and of the new independent States, approved by unanimity on 27 October of the past year, have underlined the capital importance of security *considerándola a requirement for adhesion to the Union of new States members.
The Council of the Union, in his Common Action of 24 February 1997 relative to action against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of boys, requests to States members that proceed to a review of legislation and of the procedures in vigour in these spheres to end to watch by that the types of behaviour mentioned are object of effective penal sanctions.

Therefore, to respect the Regulation of this Assembly and the Regulation by the that they govern deputies, to guarantee that deputies enjoy of the rights that *les awards said Regulation, the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, with support, as it announced before, of the Group *PEE, requested postponement to guarantee that *nos adjusted to article 112 of Regulation on the application of urgency procedure.
#would Be Presidency #finnish #willing to recognise that they still have to celebrate varied meetings of the Council before it finalise Presidency and that it #can *utilizarlas like a very useful precedent to establish his *credenciales in terms of opening - *algo that, *me fear, no exists in these moments - guaranteeing like minimum that *cuando publish press communiqués at the end of the meetings of the Council, said communiqués of press collect exactly the sense of the vote of country on each #one of the subjects subjected to vote?
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0059\/1999) of Mr. *Pirker, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on regulation proposal (*CE) of the Council (*COM(1999) 260 - *C­0082\/1999 - 1999\/0116(*CNS)) relative to the creation of the system "*EURODAC" for comparison of the digital prints of asylum applicants and foreigners.
Regarding enlargement of the *OMC so that it include also investments, volume notes with satisfaction that the European Parliament has manifested *fírmemente #one and time in the sense that no it is necessary to repeat errors of *AMI, that responsibilities of investors according to the guidelines of the *OIT and of the *OCDE have to define to time that the right of investors, and that -by a clear majority- it is necessary to establish a European Code of Behaviour for companies multinationals (amendment 15).
4) in accordance with the positions that always have defended in Parliament, on purpose of the review of the Treaties of *Maastricht and of *Amsterdam, in the sense to keep consecrated the historical balance founder among great and small States, #can not approve this resolution that opens the "box of #Pandora" for a Treaty that accepts like just the supremacy of States on #others, in comparison with the principle of equality among #all the #european citizens.
Know well that alcohol produces dependency and also that there are persons that dies owing to alcohol abuse, without embargo, there #be a fundamental difference in the case of substances, because in the majority of the cases to persons *le results possible to control tobacco consumption and alcohol in a different measure to the that *les is possible to youngsters immersed in drug abuse.
In general lines, also is favourable trial on strength of fast intervention of the European Union, although there #be had #some #discordant voices regarding this matter, as it always has *sucedido in history no only of the European Parliament, but of Parliaments national, *cuando treats of problems that in mood *atañen to military looks, that #can or #can not talk of a #european army.
Recently the Court has confirmed that, although a Been member authorise games of chance, #the same has faculty to put limits to offer gave said games and *ello in consideration to the goals of public interest like control of the wish to play, prevention of frauds or of offences and employment of the benefits obtained for ends of public interest.
*Me #would enjoy to know #if Commissioner #would suit in that the two last deputies that have asked to the Commission the adoption of measures #would take better in asking to the leader of his own party, Mr. *Blair, that reduce the very high level of the pound -kept in level too much #alto by the high types of interests of Realm Joined- to a realistic level and also achieve that Mr. *Blair initiate the campaign to adhere to the euro, with it that #would have greater transparency.
Therefore, to sight of the previous experiences and also of the statement of today, *yo want to direct a very clear warning to the Council: #if for the spring has not reached a satisfactory solution for programs *plurianuales bear *Kosovo and the *Balcanes western, accompanied of the corresponding commitment of the Council, will have to manoeuvre in waters very difficult in the frame of the budgetary procedure of the year 2001.
Is true that, in the #european budget, acts worse *cuando carries out of the #european continent: 10 millions of euros for #Asia central, 14 millions and half for the populations *desarraigadas of *América #latin, 4 millions for the human rights in *África *austral and in *Timor, etc. *Eso #would be well #if, during time, did not consider the possibility to reduce in 5 millions of euros credits in favour of beekeepers, by true, to the that take competition honey imports adulterated of foreigner.
#One of advances achieved in the meeting of Monday of the Environment Council is the adoption of a common posture by part of the Council, in relation with the strategic Managerial call of evaluation of repercussions in the environment, the *cual offers a splendid instrument to evaluate the effects in the environment of different programs and activities, included the effects of the atmospheric broadcasts.
The conciliation Committee has got likewise to commitment according to the *cual program *Socrates will contribute to development of a "#european dimension of education and of training" , in place of "an educational space European" , as it had asked Parliament, or of "an educational cooperation" , formulation of character feebler, that the Council had preferred to the principle.
It that has put in *entredicho is not the existence of #tending norms to organise the international trade or the own existence of a world-wide organisation of trade, but the fact that the *OMC pretends to be source of #all normative, referee of #all things, the supreme judge of the future world.
According to the rules of the external politics and of common defence, according to the *cual States members coordinate, after all, performance in the international organisations, the initiative and decision power are totally in hands of the Council, in practice, in hands of a group of skilled civil servants that have a natural tendency to concentrate in his own problems.
By #everything *ello, in the 50º anniversary of Gin Agreements, and *cuando owe *comprometernos #all -Parliament, the Commission and the Council- to boost knowledge of the humanitarian international Right and support to the organisations that have like responsibility defence, *le occurs to the Council #any concrete initiative to spread the humanitarian international Right among citizens of the Union?
#If Mr. deputy to Parliament wants to know more of the real conditions of animal transport or wants to put the subject in knowledge of the Commission, perhaps was convenient that *le formulate the question directly to the Commission, since it is specific task of the Commission control fulfillment of disposals of Directives valid or take part in the subject *cuando disposals are not fulfilled.
Improve small and medium enterprises and favour measures that contribute to improve competitiveness has been #one of the goals of Parliament by the fundamental paper that exert in the creation of employment and for considering that #any one actions oriented to the small and average economic operators boost the economic growth European in general and signal a safe path to reach the economic and social cohesion of the Community.
#If well the current normative capacity in the frame of the European Union did not allows still the adoption of a legal diet *transfronterizo in this field, expect that in a future #this was possible, especially after Culture Ministers of *Austria and *Alemania, in February of the past year, considered that this question, in what #such, *reviste character *transfronterizo and like this have manifested it by writing.
Believe that it is very important that explain that the terrible rapes of the human rights, like the that have lived and live in #Sierra Lion, are *algo that to *nosotros like Europeans *nos *incumbe, because according to conception the human rights and the human dignity are indivisible all over the world and because we are not had to tolerate this selective conception that conducts to that we allow that the acts of violence that produce in vicinities *nos seem more conclusive that violence eruptions, like the that witness in #Sierra Lion from takes years.
Like this as, in spite of disappointment that *me produces the fact that President in exercise was to reach an agreement among the two States members, #this is beyond all doubt a field in the that the Council #can adopt positive measures attending to worry by the human rights and respecting norms of an institution that, #if well it did not forms part of the EU, yes has respect and remains mentioned in part of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Anyway want to take advantage of also this opportunity to appreciate of heart to Parliament, especially to the speakers and to #all the that have shown a big interest or that have been involved in the debate of the enlargement process, for having given spirit #one and time to the Commission so that it took also his own initiatives with the end of *salvaguardar the good rhythm of the process of enlargement.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted to say in the first place that the Subject Commission Economic and Monetary *congratula of the presentation of these two directives because enlargement to entities no banking of broadcast of electronic money *nos seems a fine measure to increase competition in this matter and, therefore, improve the quality of service loaned and prices that will earn to consumers.
treats of the problem -and the problem is only east- of the minimum prudential norms that, ensuring stability and the solidity of entities of electronic money, open the path to the mutual recognition of permission and supervision and, through road, to the free circulation of operators and of services.
#This #can seem dared regarding definitions that appear in the national public rights, but had account at the same time of urgency that exists and of pressure of the Council by that respect terms established -have some calendars-, is indispensable to continue work, and *nos satisfies the request formulated in this sense, especially because have in front of our Assembly to commissioner that has shown that dominated perfectly these questions, that knew to listen it that asks Parliament and that has authority in front of the governments and, specifically, to the Council *ECOFIN.
The Group *Europa of Nations has presented six amendments that clear the principle of prevention, that expand the of sanitary security of the alimentary products, including organisms modified genetically, the phytosanitary products or hormones used like factor of growth, #as well as the prohibition to use meats pertinent of slaughterhouses or bones of animals for the manufacture of animal flour.
In this sense, this crisis, that began with the approval or no approval of the management for 1996 and of the continuation for 1997, concerning the *cual neither recommend approval of the management in this week but postponement of the approval of the management, has been a necessary crisis to extract of here the positive approaches that *nos #would enjoy to have taken get still, gentleman *Liikanen, to this Commission.
Group has been coherent in position; graces also to the *tozudez or to rigour of speaker, Mr. *Elles, #all Plenary has followed at the end this approach, and today register hit that in principle only have to appreciate it to person, in concrete, to the speaker, Mr. *Elles, by report on the approval of the management of the budget 1996.
The nomination of Mr. Roman *Prodi in the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of *Berlín was the *primer step. State Bosses and of Government have shown with the designation of Mr. *Prodi performance capacity of the European Union and determination to resolve of fast way and *convincente the crisis occurred.
In intervention has mentioned *usted almost #all the key words for the next five years: agriculture and cities, competition and it social, youth, the greater persons, the anonymous societies, small and medium enterprises, the protection of consumer and liberalisation, enlargement and relation with States Joined.
The that we have voted in favour of the proposal of the Council obeys to the fact that the present majority in Parliament will follow earning in practice 1.000 euros by trip that costs 400 crowns, for example, and *nosotros want to give priority to renewal process and cleansing regarding the *viáticos before that to our opposition to some labour conditions and *retributivas common, taking special emphasis in point in the need that it was possible to tax the community wage nationally.
To the contrary that fears that have expressed, seems that *Europa is rows in front of the crisis and that integration processes are inwardly and also *exteriormente a new dynamic, simply because the #european alternatives #can see better that never in crisis time. On the one hand, alternative that represents Parliament, the *Europa of integration, that means #one *Europa in peace, with stability and welfare and, on the other hand, the old image of *Europa that find in wars of the *Balcanes: nationalism with the consequence of wars, trips and misfortune.
Regarding the amendments 3 and 4, the Commission has approved a conjoint statement in the Regulation according to the *cual, the Commission will provide #all the oral information to the Council and to Parliament on the economic situation of the countries *beneficiarios that receive loans, #as well as on the risks that have explained to hour to present the annual report.
Is #this the main protest, the most vehement protest, that *les transmit by part of the commission. And in name of #the same urge to the Presidency of the Council to that it promote a culture of collaboration with the radically new Parliament in a field #where the state authority and power on the rights of citizens and the fundamental rights leave to feel with special virulence.
The #one of May, the Council decided by means of procedure written integrate to personnel of the Secretariat of *Schengen in the General Secretariat of the Council. Expect that like this we reach to put final point to the debates on this subject that have come *sucediendo lately and that the Presidency, States members and also personnel of the Secretariat of the Council #can go back to concentrate fully in work that *nos awaits in these two last months of the Presidency #german.
Have to achieve a balance among the civil freedoms, freedom of expression, freedom of persons to put in Internet it that they want to, without more *entrometimiento official of it that #would have in the postal services or in telephone, and *contrapesar the #another argument that companies do not have why find with persons that *infrinjan the rights of intellectual property, that *infrinjan logos and pretend to be company that are not.
Although in the period immediately back to the resignation of president *Suharto had great hopes that at last it #would remain opened the path to a peaceful solution of the problems of *Timor Oriental, after century chamber of *derramamiento of blood in the that has died a third part of the population like consequence of the #indonesian invasion of 1975, hopes have not fulfilled.
Gentleman President, security of the existent nuclear plants and of the that are, represents a goal *prioritario in front of the perspective of adhesion, #such as they have highlighted in reiterated occasions Parliament and the Commission with occasion of the relative package to Diary 2000, #as well as the Council in the field of the nuclear security with regard to the future enlargements of our Union.
The strict fulfillment of norms of the World-wide Organisation of Trade and of the Agreement on the Textile, in particular the calendar of liberalisation, control of the *dumping and the fraudulent practices, access to the market of third countries and limitation of the bilateral agreements, will have to constitute requirements *ineludibles of the European Union.
am not *yo the one who has to *recordarle that #this *Europa has 20 millions of unemployed -unemployment is a problem that mine his social cohesion-, that #this *Europa is in *entredicho in the conquests of civilisation made like the of the welfare, by politics *neoliberales, these same politics *neoliberales of the *cuales *usted has *ensalzado the *ulterior need of flexibility in his previous speeches and that, by the contrary, has supposed decrease of the quality of work and of quality of life, to difference of it that proposes for the future.
The fault of Mr. *Bangemann consists in having taken patent this basically corrupt system, so that any #european voter #can see it and in consequence prefer to remain home day of the elections, as it already took the majority days 10, 11, 12 and 13 June depriving of form to this assembly of any type of democratic legitimacy.
Obviously, #this is not the opinion of my Group, neither neither the opinion of the Expert Committee, that in chapter 7 declares *pertinentemente that the distinction in breast of the Commission among politics and management is not *defendible, quote, neither *jurídicamente neither in practice, that this distinction allows to skew the political responsibilities, that it logical is that it was deleted in benefit of the hierarchical subordination regarding the politically responsible commissioners.
*Usted *nos has presented in person of Mrs. *Schreyer to politics experienced that it still will need shooting in #any that another subject of #european field, since first it will have to adapt to #some moods of operation, but that has put to day quickly and of exhaustive way on the very complex subject of the budgetary politics and that it is very conscious of the future challenges in this field.
Gentleman President of the European Commission, #would wish to begin in point in that it has remained Mr. *Donnelly, the *segunda splits of mission, work program, because I believe that, more that of the collective or individual responsibilities, that, of course, consider also important subject, restoration work of the prestige and of creativity of the European Commission depends especially of work program.
Have to say that so much to pensioners that *me have commanded to seat number 270 of the European Parliament, as to me *nos has satisfied the comment of Commissioner designated Mrs. #Anna *Diamantopulu that, when answering to #one of my questions during auditions -with regard to the *cuales it is necessary to remember so much it that it was very as it that no- answered that has very in account the problem of the greater persons that expect pension and that the fifteen States members no longer is in situation to pay, since Insurances are feeble and have deficit.
To time, at all has advanced on the need of *imposición public prosecutor to capital movements, regarding adaptation need of the national social diets to the current demographic tendencies, it that shows that, to end of accounts, the goal is not a greater social justice, but, to the contrary, #one *agravación of the social inequalities.
Request that the institutions of the European Union support the sending *urgentísimo of a strong civil mission and of security strength of Nations Joined, of proportional dimension to the gravity of the situation, to achieve that *Timor constitute like independent State, it that will demand long along the *cual Nations Joined will have to keep an unambiguous support and the European Union help *apolítica and economic indispensable.
The *segunda is the following: Want to take an urgent appeal to our European Parliament so that, when talking of the #indonesian question, take a clear distinction among the military diet of Indonesian, the elections that celebrated and that they were a reflection of a long and deep process of transformation that only finishes to begin in an enormous empire of the that *Timor Oriental is not more that a small fragment, and the big suffering of village #indonesian.
concealment of a common pit in the that *yacían the bodies of 15 #serbian murdered around the middle of July in the outskirts of *Gnjilane, zone under responsibility of troops #american, poses serious *interrogantes around paper of call *Afuerza of peace\@, since in function of tolerance or support, the #serbian population of *Kosovo is victim of an extended ethnic cleansing that shows sensitivity difference of the international community about the protection of the human rights, that gives by safe.
Without embargo, regarding the composition of the direction council of the agency, do not comprise reasons that #would have to induce to Parliament to foresee the nomination of seven independent experts only by part of the Commission and #this against of the proposals formulated by the own Commission that, in dissonance with the Committee attach to #the same, has foreseen, by the contrary, the presence of representative of each #one of States members.
In section 3, the European Parliament demands "an open and innovative approach on character of the Letter, nature of the rights that will have to appear in *ella, #as well as on paper and the position of #this in the constitutional evolution of the Union" , it that shows will of no limit , simply, to collect the rights in vigour, as it asked the Council.
A fraudulent escape of the money of foreign help, capital flight #russian in the last ten years estimated among the 150.000 and 300.000 millions of dollars and a #russian economy that has gone back to barter trade *nos prevent to have really contrives of the *envergadura of the financial crisis in the Russian Federation.
Lady Speaker, in my opinion Parliament #would not have to leave without taking advantage of the opportunity to take a statement on the mandate in turn of the *WTO, because the Council of Ministers will give the mandate to the Commission on 13 October and #would be really a pity #if this mandate awarded without knowing it that thinks Parliament of *Europa on the subject.
Of course, results ironic, as we said yesterday in Development Commission, that Budget Commission voted the past week to reduce the budgetary line on attention of the reproductive health and the work in matter of *HIV\/AIDS to half -of 25 millions to 12 millions of euros- and that now are investment need in this sector.
Therefore, welcome are information campaigns oriented to sensitise to the public opinion on the subjects related with saving energetic, without embargo, do not see how the adoption of legislative measures excessively strict #can be the most effective method to improve the energetic intensity of the final demand.
Consistently with obligation to defend the interests of States members; consistently with the values of equity and social progress that proclaim like #ours; consistently with world project that want to contribute to build, more balanced and more *solidario; but consistently also with performance kept by #many of *nosotros and #many of our compatriots in *Europa during four decades *esforzándonos for finishing with apartheid and dreaming with instauration in *Sudáfrica of a diet of freedom and of dignity for #all the #south african.
Our new Parliament sends today a new and clear signal of forceful -support and sustained- to a peace process that goes to open the path to progress, democracy, respect to the human rights and hope in the future for #all villages of the region and for the peaceful coexistence among #Israel and the independent state of Palestinian.
Have to respect measures, because of mood will be of *facto colonisation politics, and *eso that the European Union, together with the rest of the International Community, States Joined included, always have condemned politics and #all know that politics #israeli of settlements constitutes a big obstacle in the long path to peace and to an authentic #palestinian State.
So that in occasion the road of hope that opens after the signature of *Sharm The-*Sheikh do not remain again closed in the future, is necessary that sensitivity and the political intelligence of the new ruling of State of #Israel, #whose security want guaranteed, promote measures able to create confidence sustained in the #palestinian part, so that the peaceful road, recently reopened, scope, it before possible, the dip definite.
Regarding the external politics, believe that it is necessary to insist in the fact that no only have commercial commitments, but that are linked by agreements *multilaterales on the environment, by international agreements relative to respect of the human rights, and in my opinion -that create share colleagues-, these commitments have at the same time in the ethical plane and in the political plane a more important value that the *librecambio.
Anyway, have to say that negotiations of the Round of #Millenium do not have to prejudice the essential elements of the agricultural model European neither the necessary reforms so that, in addition to it agreed in Diary 2000, protect the internal development of the territories of the goal 1 with familiar exploitations based in earth, in front of the interests of the great industrial companies and of big distribution.
To me *me #would enjoy to ask to the Council, that no to the Commission, how values in general lines development of this campaign; #if it is truth that #this has been a good year for tuna and #if therefore they have averted conflicts among the distinct fleets that fish in the *Cantábrico; how number of ships has reduced country like consequence of the moratorium; #if this method is as valid to brake pressure on tuna populations.
Regarding the question of assignments for the structural measures, divergences among the Council and Parliament summary in two points: in the first place, the amount of advance of the relative payment to the new structural actions and, second, the calendar of settlement of the ancient permissions that still have not paid.
Since a big part of the community budget executes by means of States members, *yo *le #would recommend sincerely to the Council that watch by efficiency, transparency and a clean execution in this field, so that the Commission do not go back to see forced to follow resorting in the future to approval procedure of the management in interest of a clean execution of the budget.
*Yo want to express, therefore, first of all my *congratulaciones and my gratitude to the Monetary Institute European, to the national banks, to the Central Bank European, represented today here by President, Mr. *Duisenberg, but likewise to States members, that promoted through numerous necessary political reforms the *ulteriores structural and institutional reforms and fulfilled convergence criteria, and also to citizens, that are with an increasing consensus this necessary step to the #european integration
Group receives with satisfaction training of organ for the preparation of the Letter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in the belief that the wide parliamentary scope of composition reflects the realisation of the process of democratisation of the better EU that the usual Conference *Intergubernamental.
Remain, without embargo, two obstacles: firstly, the abandonment of the community preference in the agricultural field, and already know the problems that exist in the sectors of tomato, or of horticulture; and, the second point, with regard to the *cual #can not yield, #would consist in exchange of fishing right for Spaniards by immigration supplement, in #one *Europa that has 18 millions of unemployed.
By it that refers to the report *Cunha on the celebration of a new Protocol by the that they fix fishing possibilities and the financial compensation, foreseen in the Agreement with the Republic of *Angola for the period comprised among 3 May 1999 and on 2 May of the 2000, wanted to signal that it treats of a classical protocol, that makes possible access to resources *pesqueros during a determined and fixed period #one *contrapartida financial.
With my innocence and naivety, *yo had thought that, *cuando the Managerial Committee Scientist gathered the past week and took announcement -in fact, took it Mr. *Pascale, French *él, like President of said Committee-, in the that indicated the unanimous approval of said committee, in the sense that meat of bovine British is so innocuous like any #another meat of bovine of the EU or possibly more that #any of the world, already had got to the top of the pyramid.
Gentleman President, wanted to congratulate to the speaker Mr. *Hughes, regarding ordination of work time of persons of the sea, by proposal to Parliament to approve, without modifications, the common position of the Council with regard to the application of the labour day of persons of the sea on board of ships that use community ports.
Also expect that the procedure by the that *nos have seen forced to examine the present Communication in Parliament do not take like model for the future, since it also has been the cause, gentleman colleague *Lehne, that we have not had the opportunity to debate the amendments in commission and *nos to forced to proceed of a very atypical way for this House.
But a true social support to the goals that determine with persons in difficulty in the frame of procedures formalised is the only mood that helps and incentives for employment research *surtan #all effects, no only in the own access to employment, but also in *algo that is intimately associated to #this, is to say, the *reinserción durable of persons that are totally worn out by the destructive process of unemployment.
Consider important that carry out in programming stage to allow to workers anticipate change, expand the field of application of the directive and guarantee that #the same contain minimum prescriptions to scale community that #can not break but in the most favourable sense for workers, #as well as extend the content to the matters that affect directly to the rights of workers and future.
This strategic option referred, first of all, to the approval of the directive on the #european company and afterwards to the approval of the directive on query and information; and all #this in the logical that #if had priority the directive on the that are, #would be *complicadísima the vote of the directive on employment that, as well they know, carries in the negotiation table more of 14 years.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, agrees with considerations that with the proposal that *usted takes, practically suspend the obligations of the Council derived of the compulsory credits but that keep rights, to know, the reduction of credits no employees, and that in this way happen in fact of the compulsory credits to the no compulsory without that Parliament obtain the rights of sovereignty on this sector in the budget?

Up to now, and although the *PE has requested it clearly, these purposes have not materialised from sight point operative in program integrated for the insular regions of the EU, #where live 14 millions of citizens of 12 States members, so as to that they #can compete in the market in conditions *equitativas with the other continental regions that do not suffer from the principle of the derivative geographic disadvantage of the *insularidad.
Am in favour without place to doubts of enlargement to these new countries, but fear that, given the situation of the financial perspectives and for being these less rich countries that the current members of the Union, stress the *perifericidad and eccentricity of regions like *Galicia and *Portugal with decreases of the structural Bottoms, with it that will hamper the necessary economic cohesion and social #european.
So much more express hopes -and #can not hide worry to the *respecto- that it #can go back to study thoroughly the Law of language and the Law of parliamentary and municipal elections, that were approved after the publication of our last report, since laws, according to a first #ours impression, #can go in in conflict with the international norms in this field.
Since, in virtue of article 255, to the Commission *le corresponds the task to elaborate a relative legislative proposal to the general principles and to the limits that regulate the exercise of said right, our Institution will present in useful time proposal to the *respecto and Plenary will have like this the possibility to manifest position in the procedure of *codecisión.
posture adopted so much by the Commission as by our economic commission is more *matizada: while price stability keep and was guaranteed, #can *permitirnos a monetary politics more flexible, to condition of course that it keep and consolidate the budgetary discipline; sure enough, by fault of the enormous debt accumulated and of the important resources consecrated to service of said debt and to finance of deficit, have had to reduce during years the productive private investments.

Certainly, gentleman President, *usted today has remembered the need of an ecological tax to face up to the challenges that poses, for example, the climatic change -and #this *me satisfies- and has talked of sustainable development, without embargo, how not highlighting contradiction among affirmations and his exaggerated confidence in the results that will derive of the full liberalisation of the commercial exchanges in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade?
The 112 or 115 deputies that have voted in favour of these amendments honour with *ello to Parliament, because they express conviction that Parliament is in right to control to the Commission, control the execution of the community budget by the Commission, and that #this has the duty to respect the Treaties and provide to Parliament the necessary information.
*Yo consider that it treats of an important step with seen to the preparation of a resolution of the Security Council based in the foundation of Chapter *VII and wanted to take advantage of occasion to urge also to the permanent members of the Security Council to that they assume an active paper in the preparation of a resolution of characteristics.
politics that has developed up to now the European Union regarding *Rusia no always has been exemplary, but even so *yo want to manifest my confidence in that the combination of a global strategy and the new Regulation of *TACIS that it has to go in in vigour in the year 2000 will translate in a clear improvement of the adoption and execution of the decisions of the European Union in the field of politics relative to *Rusia.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate on the recommendation for the *segunda reading of the report (To4-0245\/99) by part of Mr. *Jarzembowsky in name of Transport Commission and Tourism relative to the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the relative Council to the application of *gravámenes to the heavy vehicles of transport of commodities by utilisation of determined infrastructures (13651\/3\/98 - *C4-0037\/99-96\/0182(*SYN)).

Consider that it is necessary that carry out two things: in the first place, the *restablecimiento of a constitutional and civil order and the end of the coup d'état that -as they said my colleagues- is the *decimoctavo from half of the years seventy; second and to time, is precise to continue the process of national agreement also with strengths that no only are military and that pretend to follow keeping the hegemony of population groups of an island with regard to the other.
Finally, some last words directed to Mr. *Poettering, without spirit of *referirme of special way to the political decisions interns, since I consider that we are in the European Parliament and here #would not have to talk of *Alemania like main subject. Without embargo, *yo #can *asegurarle thing, gentleman *Poettering: precisely the green Party learnt the lesson of *Bosnia and also has learnt now the of *Kosovo, and also #would have assumed responsibility with another composition of the Government.
To the colleague of the *PDS that, on the one hand, *nos has criticised that have ignored the #french positions #as well as the goals of the #french politics but that, to time, *nos has thrown strongly in face the deficient results of commitment of the agricultural market of the summit of *Berlín, only #can *decirle that they are looks in mood interrelated. #would Have to examine more exactly #if at the end, by like this say it, do not drops *usted same in a tangle of contradictions.

#would Give *usted to the majority of the Assembly, of circumstantial form, the possibility to pronounce on the political affinities that they #can exist among #such or *cual deputy that has stamped signature to foot of constitution writing of group and know very well that exist, also in breast of the majority groups, factions that are not neither with a lot of agreement among *ellas on a common political program.
Therefore, wanted to go back to remember that in the last session *plenaria *yo signalled that, of compliance with Regulation, the Assembly decides on the composition of the tables of the delegations *interparlamentarias, but corresponds to the mixed parliamentary commissions proceed, as they take it also the parliamentary commissions, to the election of tables, #such as we have taken it in the Commission of Inner Subjects, for example, and in #all the commissions.
For example, is not possible to detain delinquency organised, the traffic of persons, money bleaching and terrorism only through the police collaboration, #if to time allows the free circulation among the countries members, so much of citizens community as of #all the other, and much less #if surveillance of the external borders sees weakened, it that it is unavoidable with enlargement of the Union.
#can not admit that the key field of justice, that no only affects to the protection of face citizen to outside, but that also guarantees the protection of citizen in front of the state institutions, do not take into account the protection against erroneous executive measures neither the corresponding control in benefit of citizens.
Amen of *eso, has not had objection in access to the proposal of the #french Government to assign to Pascal *Lamy wallet of External Trade, although this gentleman is architect of the "system #Jacques *Delors" .

Always have been of the opinion that a military intervention foreigner only had to take place in the national interest of nation-Been that it treat, and without embargo the grave deterioration and the spiral of violence in the region required the adoption of measures and fulfilled conditions of the new external politics ethical concerning the *cual *Portugal is Been member of plenary right.
In the resolutions adopted in June of 1999 on the *preparativos of the third meeting of Ministers of the *OMC, the Council remitted clearly to the agreements of State Bosses in Colony Summit days 3 and 4 June 1999, in the *cuales supported negotiations that cover a wide fan of subjects, among *ellos the labour norms, like the best half to achieve substantial results and balanced in benefit of #all members of the *OMC.
The Commission already has remitted a document to the Presidency of the Council and to Parliament in the that proposes a clear division of functions of services of the agency and of personnel among *Pristina and *Salónica, with #all the operative services centred in *Pristina and the director of the agency rooted there in operation centre.
Report (To5-0010\/99) of Mrs. *Morgantini, in name of Development Commission and Cooperation on decision proposal of the Council (*COM(1999) 334 - *C5-0059\/1999 - 1999\/0143(*CNS)) by the that approves the text of the *Décimo Agreement *CE-*OOPS for the period 1999-2001, before the signature of the Agreement by the Commission and Organism of Public Dramas and Aid of Nations Joined for Palestinian refugees in the Near Orient
Likewise, services of the Commission, that has managed helps to *Rusia, have to elaborate a report on employment modalities of bottoms and, finally, asks the creation of investigation commission, composed by the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the *BEI and the *BERD, that check how many and #which finances sent to *Rusia have used for the planned ends, for example, program *TACIS.
Regarding #Grecia, already has said, damages also have been great, have thrown roots in the population - have visited the zone - anxiety by the morning, especially for having ascertained that, in the construction of the houses, it that predominated was the benefit and no care to persons that were for buying a house.
The *avispados advisers that are to side *me say that according to Regulation, has been correct behaviour of Parliament and of session President, my predecessor, as in the agenda says that among the 15 and 16 hours will take place the statement of the Commission on the financial crisis in *Rusia and that urgency debate will begin immediately after the statement of the Commission or to more take to the 16 hours.
The *segunda will be the of how competitions will transfer *usted of the Commission to this new agency and maybe to #some of the that already exist, so that they #can exert better tasks and assist to the agency commissioned of the *inocuidad of foods in the resolution of the relative problems to foods in *Europa. )How will guarantee the surrender of accounts of these new agencies? )#would Examine *usted, for example, the possibility to celebrate auditions here, in the European Parliament, to choose to the directors of said agencies?
Alas, to date, in cases, citizen only receives with hindsight information on these subjects of the daily life that *le affect, *cuando in a so delicate field performances #would have to have preventive character, of mood that chain alimentary ensure really the corporal and mental welfare of consumers and do not convert in object of speculation for the economic interests.
The resolution is at least a statement of our position on relations with our big neighbour, and #if Parliament had not expressed his opinion on this important subject, #would have supposed a *incumplimiento of responsibility like international parliament, and a #sad indication that politics of Fortress *Europa is alive and receives more support of the that had to in breast of this Assembly.
In the Protocol of *Kioto, and also in the agreement on the climate, stipulates that #if a community of nations with economic cooperation, as it is EU case, do not fulfils in group commitments purchased, responsibility *recae on each #one of the integral states of the community, is to say, that #if #some States members do not fulfil the goals, #all the Union suffers the consequences.
But also has to ask to services of *Euratom that effect a complete analysis of the group of the official regulations of security of head offices, and around head offices, in *Europa, to know #if it respects the group of security conditions; to know #if they still #can add procedures of urgency in case that they produce regrettable human negligences, that are worse, especially in these last years, that an unpredictable accident that, by definition, #can seed panic.
#can not finish my presentation without *indicarles that #this is not the only solution of the problem and that our Parliamentary Commission wishes to put of relief the need that other parliamentary commissions occupy of this risk for security in the next directive on broadcasts of commercial vehicles weighed and also in proof norms of vehicles, for *cerciorarse that the cover defective of deposits of fuel withdraw of circulation, was in full road, was in annual proofs of the commercial vehicles.
Concerning worry of Parliament by the possible resultant consequences of transfer of assignments of category 4 allocated to help provision to the less advanced countries, do not have to forget that, of compliance with the Agreement of *Lomé, the European Bottom of Development funds helps of the EU to countries.
principle positions in this sense, together with the balance among independence, reliability, transparent advertising and the necessary consolidation of the monetary dialogue, are from point of seen decisive elements to judge work of #ECB and also for the formulation of our report and the approach of work procedure of Parliament.
Wail, therefore, that frustrated in commission stage and have not presented today in front of this Assembly the attempts to demand to the Bank that published the names of assistants, the vote on the monetary measures, after grace period of some two years, #as well as the publication of the models *econométricos of #ECB.
The Commission will open also a debate on other important political fields. conflict prevention, the previous forecast to the crisis and to catastrophes and the humanitarian help based and focused to the human rights, is to say, the humanitarian help that centres more in the human rights of the victims.
The new global approach that has decided to give to immigration subjects and asylum, #as well as commitment of the European Council to apply entirely Gin Convention on the Statute of Refugee and the decision to aspire to a #european system of asylum are steps in the correct direction.
Lady Speaker, the Council of *Tampere that finishes to devote to the #european space, called of "Freedom, Security and Justice" adopted #some positive technical decisions to intensify cooperation in the fight against delinquency and favour the judicial coordination, by means of a greater utilisation, for example, of the mutual recognition of the judicial resolutions in civil or penal matter that *usted same, lady Speaker, recommended, by it other, in his preliminary speech.
My Group had expressed the wish that like this it was from the case "*Michelin": said of mood -as it finishes to repeat , the simultaneous announcement fact by the direction of this big company, in front of financial analysts, of the #obtaining of substantial benefits, by part, and, by #another, the decision to suppress in *Europa 7.500 places of work.
#One, that *me #would seem quite positive, #would consist in creating instance of *concertación of experts in the #european level without subtracting minor can of decision to the national states on the fundamental matters, the most next to worries of citizens; the #another, that *me #would seem much more negative, #would consist in creating a supplementary element to deprive to nations of right of *salvaguarda, that, without embargo, is inalienable.
transparency of the process, regarding the preparation of the general guidelines of economic politics and the guidelines in matter of politics of employment, consolidates more with a *dictamen official and public of the Economic and Social Committee that with character query *tripartito that, at most, #can *tipificarse like obligation of prudence and diligence #Can the Commission answer the question of how sees relation among dialogue *macroeconómico proposed and the Economic and Social Committee already existent?
By the contrary, why #can not say that #if we are able to invest tendency to the *decremento of the economic growth, thanks to liberalisation and thanks to know accept openly the challenges of the new economy, will have wealth and will exist the possibility to increase wages *vinculándolos to productivity and to the results of companies in place of *vincularlos to the national collective agreements or Europeans.
Of here that *me seem regrettable that now, to the principle of the process, parts give the impression to protect in the importance of his own autonomy in the field of competitions: the administrations concerning his budgetary politics, the social speakers concerning negotiations *salariales, and the Central Bank concerning the monetary politics.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, the present managerial form splits of reduction strategy of broadcasts CO2 in the field of transport of the EU, the *cual supports in four *pilares: information to consumers -the present managerial-, fiscal stimuluses of States members, surveillance of CO2 broadcasts of tourism vehicles and the Agreement among the commission and the car industry.
The fact that it was difficult remains shown by two circumstances: a common agreement almost general on urgency and the importance to adopt effective politics to struggle against unemployment and with regard to that #this occur inside a frame in that the necessary support to a positive economic process keep the social cohesion and the social model European.
The structural unemployment possesses varied indicators: labour costs excessively high, deficient flexibility in the labour days and in the biographies of workers, service industry insufficiently developed, a regulatory density excessively high by part of state and of bureaucracy, speeds of innovation too much slow, periods too much long of transfer among the scientific knowledge and his put in practice in production.
In this sense, think to treat the subject in the next ministerial meeting of the European Conference of the Civil Aviation, that will take place on 28 January next, and, #such as I have indicated before, the communication of the Commission devoted to this question will present to Parliament to finals of this year and to the Council of Ministers of Transport, specifically in the meeting of 6 December.
To his *Señorías *les corresponds a fundamental paper to hour to reflect sight points and to contribute to the preparation of an external politics and of common security more effective, more coherent, nearer to worries of citizens and that reflect values and the principles that have forged identity like Europeans.
Had wished, gentleman #Solana, that was more explicit on bottom of this essential question and that *nos said how, in the field of the *PESC, went to contribute to correct, in measure in that it still was possible, the most disastrous consequences for our continent of actions that *usted same, #if it has not ordered, at least has protected in *Yugoslavia whereas General Secretary of NATO and that today have in front of *nosotros.
In these decisions are also commitments of States members to build a specific military strength that strengthen the capacity of the EU to make #worthy actions of credit, in accordance with the principles of Nation Convention Joined, without that put in cloth of trial the particular interests of *algún Been member and without that the EU take #his the fundamental missions of NATO.
The main focus of attention has to be the consolidation of a world-wide order of trade and the opening of the markets or have to put in a *primer plane defence of our economic and social model European, of the social and ecological economy of market and of the community politics that come developing in favour of the interests of citizen and of consumer?
Gentleman President, it that it is necessary to appreciate in the Report *Schwaiger is the attempt to conciliate it that up to now has resulted *irreconciliable, and the considerable effort of the speaker notes, definitely, from the *primer considering, in that to recognition of the strong increase of the world-wide exchanges, thanks to relations *multilaterales, #can not but *contraponer the fault of a substantial reduction of the economic inequalities in the world.
By the contrary, #if we take road integrated of bond among intellectual property and development, simultaneously to the extension of guarantees, have to watch for boosting the direct investment like main vehicle of transfer of technology to countries, #as well as for developing with *ellos agreements of technological cooperation and perhaps -launch this idea- by *reflexionar on the reinforcement of the #european investment in fundamental investigation on living beings to share the benefits with *ellos.
Had account that the proposals of the Commission -and to this *respecto am very grateful to Mr. *Barnier- foresee a similar division for modification procedures, *me seems a sample of *pusilanimidad that the Commission of Constitutional Subjects of Parliament yes approve division in two of the Treaties, but do not accept differentiation of the procedures.
Without embargo, want to indicate that, from sight point of the Union, probably is quite better politics to adopt a constructive attitude so that *Turquía do not give entirely back to the European Union and leave to try fulfil with the principles that *nosotros have added in the criteria of *Copenhague for adhesion and in other #ours resolutions.
For example, the final mandate awarded by the Council, on 22 October, do not mentions defence of the principle of the community preference, in spite of having been approved by the Council "Agriculture" of 27 September, the *cual had not been of the all satisfactory, when forgetting the principle of the alimentary independence in *Europa.
How #can sue villages of *Europa the *reforzamiento of the international paper of the EU with the creation of a new political entity and juridical and with impulse of defence and common security, *cuando the EU is responsible, beside NATO, of the first action of war after the *Segunda World-wide War, aggression, in break of notion of international right, against *Yugoslavia?
But #this has posed inconvenient, because the problem that has Canarian, like other regions *ultraperiféricas -*Azores, *Madeira and the #french departments of *Ultramar-, is that they are regions very moved away of the community territory, divided in small insular territories, with markets very reduced, with some problems of enormous transport and, besides, with derivative difficulties, for example, of population excess, of rain diet very irregular and of poor floors, that prevent that they develop normal activities.
*Cuando prepared yesterday my intervention on the Reports *Morillon, in a text of the European Parliament, of the Secretariat of Work Group for Enlargement, of International and Institutional Relations of the General Direction *IV, under responsibility of Mrs. *Martine *Chariot, in point 6 of the report on relations of *Turquía with the European Union affirms *algo surprising and of the all unacceptable:
But also want to say that in the Basque Country is absolutely necessary a political commitment as in *Irlanda, of form that no costs the *cerrazón, even the reactionary character -#would say *yo- of postures of the #spanish Government, that denies to accept a political commitment with the national parties Basques in the course of the peace process.
A last information: Mrs. *Maj *Britt *Théorin, speaker of Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities, has adopted an initiative that *me seems of it nicer, the to send to #all colleagues masculine a letter for *animarlos to carry a white bow like signal of his public commitment of not committing violences neither *excusar or *callar violence against women.
In the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, in view of that there #be parity among the world of sport, on the one hand, and, by #another, the of the governments and that #all members of the administration council, therefore, also the federations and #all the national olympic committees, have engaged to put in practice, each in his field, the decisions adopted by the agency, there are hopes.

And paper of the European Union, of the Commission and of the European Parliament in this sense is important, since, as it has signalled, there are agreements signed among the European Union and *Macao. Is well that, during the next 50 years, the European Parliament and our #european institutions #can follow the evolution of *Macao, a lucky evolution, create *yo.
Regarding the decisions on credit granting of the European Bank of Investments, the mentioned project *Gardaland has been treated before in Parliament in the turn of oral questions to the Commission and, according to information received by the Council, in occasion exposed very in detail the arguments that defend this project and advantages, so that I do not go to go back to *repetirlos.

The Council is conscious that, in the case of Mrs. Titin *Loizidou, the European Court of the rights of man considered that *Turquía had violated the European Treaty for the protection of the rights of man, to the *inculparse in the undue appropriation of property rights in *Chipre of the North, and condemned to *Turquía to effect compensations.
The Council underlines that #all States members voted in favour of a transitory resolution on the subject, that was approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of *Europa on 6 October 1999 and in the that signalled that payment conditions proposed by the Government of *Turquía #can not be considered satisfied with the obligations imposed by sentence of the Court and also exhorted to *Turquía that reviewed posture.

Have security that our European Parliament is very satisfied for having taken part in pressures of the international community, that have contributed to that President #indonesian *Habibie have released it the past 7 September, little after the referendum of 30 August, in the that the 70,5% of the population of *Timor Oriental pronounced in favour of the independence.

conversations that have come celebrating with the speaker and #some of the remaining deputies to Parliament since it took place the debate on the report of Mr. Go *Dam, previously of Mr. *Wijsenbeek, during the session *plenaria of February have reinforced even more my *convencimiento, in this case the of Mr. *Kinnock, that we agree on the need to improve incentives and competitiveness of transport combined.

Regarding the Grandstand of Justice, here fits to highlight the fine utilisation that has taken of rent system-buys of buildings annexes to the *Palais and, on the other hand, regarding anticipation of the 50 millions of *ecus that carried out, *yo only #would highlight here *algo that in moment -the year 1997- *nos concerned: the series of commitments that kept the Government *luxemburgués with Parliament and that did not know in moment #if the #would fulfil or no...
do not agree with the editorial of paragraph 1 and wish to suppress the definite «word» of paragraph, because in Parliament has not celebrated in moment a vote on the question of the approval of the corresponding management to 1996, recommended by the Commission of Budgetary Control to this Assembly.
In both reports, in the report of Mr. *Elles, and here include also to speaker, Mr. *Brinkhorst, for 1997, it is necessary to take into account really two things: have not voted on conditions for the granting of the approval of the management, have added documents of work; #this is an unusual procedure, but believe that it has been hit and here has said it that go to take get like suggestions, and also like requirements, to the next Commission.
The Commission presented resignation as a result of the procedure of said management. Although it has reached to introduce numerous improvements, explanations and positive solutions in this process, runs the danger that approval procedure of the management and of the distinct questions #can be too much wide, since, in accordance with the fundamental regulation of the EU, corresponds to Parliament approve the budgetary management.
But especially, gentleman Commissioner, taking into account the problems posed by the previous agreements to the *OMC on this type of products, wanted to *preguntarle #if it #can engage to reopen the *dossier of the *OMC in two points: a better definition of the principle of caution, especially through investment of charge of proof in case of doubt, and, a second point, a better definition of the *dictamen *pericial, since the alimentary code #can not consider like legitimate univocal reference.

No treats of an abstract question, but that affects to the solution to questions like enlargement, the institutional reform in strict sense and the creation of a structure of external politics and of common defence that, as we see in conflict of *Kosovo, *Europa needs absolutely, because it shows that *carece of an autonomous capacity to answer to the crisis like the that are in this region.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, gentleman *Prodi, the circumstances with that confronts are difficult and at the same time also easy. Difficult to sight of the challenges that will have to confront the European Union in the next five years and easy because a renewal of the Commission had not explained never with a so wide support of Parliament, of the Council and of the #european public opinion.
#Ours dip on a long-term basis has to be, by means of a fast development of cooperation and opening the doors to the EU, the achievement in the *Balcanes of it that have achieved in the European Union: ensure democracy, build an economy that give welfare to persons and surpass the limits among the countries, so that our national identities have lower importance and that no matter #if we are #german, #portuguese, Greeks, Dutches or #swedish for life possibilities.

The Commission has proposed to continue efforts of the last years treating to centre the internal politics on growth and costs related with employment, especially investigation and the technical development, networks *transeuropeas, education and training, #as well as small and medium enterprises, that has been a parliamentary initiative.

Finally, but above #everything, is correct way in that the text recognises equality of Parliament and the Council: the committee will be chaired jointly; will gather alternatively in venues of the European Parliament and of the Council: the texts have to be signed jointly by presidents; the letters have to be signed by the *copresidentes; even the formalisation by Jurists-Linguists will carry out by the European Parliament and the Council.
*Señorías, have begun with a personal balance and *me has gone out a collective balance. The of some realisations that correspond to work, to obstinacy and to tarpaulin of #all *ustedes, with the active and loyal collaboration of #all civil servants of the General Secretariat that loan services to this Assembly, of the *free-launch , of the parliamentary assistants, of #all.

After the conclusions of the European Council of *Berlín, Commission of Regional Politics had to struggle in a significant front for the group of the #european citizens: the creation of #one *cuarta community initiative, *URBAN, allocated to the economic and social rehabilitation of cities and urban cores in crisis, with regard to promoting development *durable.

This subject *reviste a special importance in the case of the nuclear head offices, especially in it that to the construction, the operation, circuit of fuel and storage refers. #Everything *ello purchases a particular dimension of face to the enlargement agreements, since we #can not accept that States candidates to adhesion apply a normative less rigid that the that demands at present in *Europa Western.
Gentleman President, the Commission congratulates by the adoption of a common project on recognitions of diplomas by part of the Conciliation Committee and, in name of the Commission, #would wish to express my gratitude particularly to Mrs. *Gebhardt, #as well as to president and to members of the delegation of Parliament in said conciliation, by #all efforts made during these last four months to obtain this conjoint text.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam had not resolved the problem of the operation of the Institutions and, regarding the external politics, the only advance was to appoint to *Mister *PESC that, without embargo, was not still in functions during the crisis of *Kosovo that, without expecting delays and the continuous absences of *Europa, burst like a scourge and renewed crimes of the ethnic cleansing that already had *gangrenado *Bosnia.
Our goal is to increase transparency and efficiency of performances of the Council; consider that a greater transparency is indispensable condition so that citizens approve #all project of the Union.Also want that the Council of General Subjects assume paper in the direction of the Council of Ministers.
Among measures *prioritarias that have to fund in the frame of credits *OPNOVA include, among #others, mine cleansing, material purchase for house reconstruction and of public buildings, help to the companies of public services, to customs and employment program and local rehabilitation.
In the letter, Mr. *Santer specified that Mr. *Bangemann #can not undertake his new tasks and activities while it had not completed the procedure established in article 215 of the Treaty, and said likewise that #would subject to Commissioner School the question of compatibility of the planned nomination with article 213 of the Treaty.
Of course, Mr. *Bangemann is personally responsible of mood to act, but politics that orients preferably to the economic interests and especially to the interests of the great companies, is necessarily subjected to the danger that his main representatives reproduce mood of thinking as *ejecutores of politics and that devote to *maximizar his personal benefits against of any moral code.
The Government, first did not know how was it that was, adopted posture of total indifference, next wanted to throw earth on the subject until after the elections and finally took manager of panic reaction evidently exaggerated that caused all over the world boycott of products called #belgian but of the that the first victim has been my country, *Flandes, since the greater part of exports called «#belgian» of course are exports of *Flandes.
Lady Speaker, to difference of the previous orators, that were #all of nationality #english - watch by where!-, *yo #would wish to protest against the decision of Commission -quite surprising, to mood to see- to impose sanction to the #french Federation of football by a supposed discrimination in the sale of entrances in the last Glass of football World.
Although rules of mental hygiene for the weekends *me have prevented to devote to reading of the report hours that definitely deserves, believe that has an additional virtue little appreciated by my predecessors in the use of the word: in points collects positions of Parliament and proposals that were not received *favorablemente in day.
#One of the extenuating circumstances on lacks of the Commission, that *trasluce along the report, is means fault with the that explain services of the Commission to carry out politics that *nosotros, deputies, agree in the field of cooperation for development and of the humanitarian help, flags both of the community external action.
Comprise the comment of Commissioner about subsidiariness, but are because in Parliament there #be a directive of minimum frame that did not invades subsidiariness and that solves the problem when creating the obligation in States members to establish inspection inside some wide guidelines.
Say here that investigation commission on linen in Congress of Deputies already has approved conclusions, declare clearly that this commission has exempted of responsibility to Mrs. Of Palace, situating responsibility of the management, control and granting of helps in the #spanish Autonomous Communities, notoriously in the governed by #one of his *correligionarios in *Castilla-Stain.
Finally, regarding the space of justice, our purpose #would have to be the to take all it possible so that citizen have feeling to find , in #all the territory of the European Union, in front of a frame of justice that was suitable and in the that they protect rights of similar way, no only in front of criminals, but also even in front of possible excesses of the public powers.
The constructive participation of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence and Budget Commission of Parliament also deserve my gratitude, and inside moment will happen to comment the amendments presented by Budget Commission, subject to the that has referred Mr. *Khanbhai.
paper of the Commission and of the #european institutions has to, in the very concrete case of the alimentary security, limit to negotiate the principle of caution in the frame of the international agreements and to coordinate politics of States members and of the European Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0016\/99) of Mr. *Langen, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to program *plurianual of promotion of the renewable energies in the *Comuniad (*ALTENER) (1998-2002) (7122\/1\/99 - *C5-0032\/99 - 97\/0370(*COD)).
Parliament expresses, besides, in section 1 of article 1, the will that it carry out the campaign allocated to promote penetration of sources of renewable energy, #such as it already advocates in the White Book of 1997, and that they also develop new instruments and mechanisms that allow to boost penetration accelerated and coordinated in the market of #all the sustainable energetic technologies.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation (To5-0020\/1999) of Mrs. *Kinnock, in name of Development Commission and Cooperation, on decision proposal of the Council and of the relative Commission to the celebration of Trade Agreement, Development and Cooperation among the European Community, by part and the Republic of *Sudáfrica, by another (8731\/1999 *COM(1999) 245 - *C5-0154\/1999 - 1999\/0112(*AVC)).
And finally want to take a question on the budget: taking into account that almost #all transfers centre in category *cuarta, #this is, in the external actions of the Union, and that #this is #one of points that produces more dissatisfaction in my Group and, in general, in Budget Commission, did not believes gentleman President that #would be convenient to review the financial perspectives regarding the external politics of the Union?
Has foreseen the Commission use methods of communication more modern as, for example, time acquisition of advertising, of 3 to 5 minutes daily, issued among #news and sport of the main newscast of the television network with greater audience of each Been member, to present with character of divulging attainments and goals of the EU, directing mainly to the social coats that usually do not read and that definitely are not addressees of material?
Support firmly observation that has taken my colleague of the *PPE, Mr. *Bowis, that we do not owe of way export our problem of the world developed, through taxes on our old head offices with levels of problematic broadcast and move work places and production units to regions less developed, #where are less prepared to cut across degradation of the environment.
Of course, exist limits to realism; of here that we also want to use today this moment to protest by the situation in country, and take an urgent call to the Government of *Bielorrusia so that it take *algo in front of the disappearances and occupy that the missing are found, so that #this constitute reason in himself\/hisself same to initiate really dialogue that allow celebration of elections free and just, expect, the next year.
Among these political goals the human rights occupy place stood out, together with the free access to the informative means, the end of bullying against the opposition, a constructive dialogue among the opposition and the government, and backrest to program *TACIS of development of the civil society.
#Some of *ustedes have *percatado surely that the plastic materials use increasingly in vehicle industry of engine and this norm of uniform proof will offer to designers the possibility to concentrate in fulfillment of an alone norm, instead of having to consecrate efforts to fulfillment of #all a series of different norms.
Have voted in this sense amendment that corresponds to an important political commitment of Parliament, although we vote it above category 4, it that it wants to say that to day of today there #be not statute of amendment, but that corresponds to commitment of this Assembly to vote credits with occasion of the *segunda reading, mainly regarding the agreement with *Marruecos, that is a political priority of Parliament.
give account that it will be necessary to reduce in a 10 % efforts against mines *antipersonas, that also appear in our budgetary lines, or support measures to the no governmental organisations that work in the countries in development, as for example in *Guatemala or in other regions of the world, because we are unable to use imagination, because we do not want *detenernos to consider exactly of where go to go out resources?
In the first place, no *me seems #worthy of credit that from the European Parliament demand, on the one hand, to #all the institutions and very especially to the Commission the most rigorous control and expect that the organisation chart of personnel adapt to the new requirements, and *nos propose that #this remain reflected, besides, in the #european Budget, while by the #another side are not had to act in sense in our own field, regarding the budget and the administration of Parliament.
Already has signalled in brief that the report occupies especially of the year 1998, the year in the that *dictaminó how countries -eleven in total- fulfilled convergence criteria, decided where #would have headquarters of #ECB, proceeded to absorption of the *IME, initiated the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union, and the Council of #ECB decided stability strategy, based in the two *pilares already known.
Regarding past #dutch, the Central Bank of the Low Countries, that chaired during years, found in the centre of the field of social strengths #where developed the economic and social politics and *yo see it like a model for the implication of the Central Bank European in dialogue *macroeconómico #european.
The report of experts contained proposed on how #would have to concretise this bridge to make the transition to help to development or to support instruments to development, as for example programs *PHARE and *TACIS? And has determined #if the problems have origin in help of THROW and in the design of project, or #if they are imputable to the helps?
Without these minimum measures and #others, accompanied of concrete measures against company transfers inside the European Union and measures against the *dumping social in outside, the social model European, so expensive to #some of politicians, included the of rights, will not be never thing that an empty speech, it that #would contribute to strengthen feeling *antieuropeo diffuse in countries and in numerous employees.
#If part of the social speakers, the that are the world-wide competition and on the that #all are, really, of agreement in that they have to be helped and protected -because *nos interest the #european companies that they #can compete worldwide- expresses restlessness by society and by the maintenance of the social balance, have a significant argument for development and support to the social dialogue.
In effect, in this delicate stage for the European Union, while it is enlargement to the East and while they are #all the economic and financial reforms related with the introduction of coin only, do not have to forget value "culture" , the specificities and diversities of the #european culture, assessment and diffusion.
Gentleman President, to initiative of the socialist Group and with backrest of the #others Groups, Fishing Commission has formulated this oral question to the European Commission and to the, once again, absent Council of Ministers so that it expose in front of the #european citizenship #which is the current situation of contacts kept with the #moroccan authorities, with seen to negotiation for a future Agreement of fishing European Union-*Marruecos.
After the expiration of the previous agreement, gentleman Commissioner, produced a tie up that it lasted seven months, to the that it was necessary to add the natural biological stops and stops no so biological and more arbitrary, imposed by the #moroccan Administration to a European Commission that did not know to defend the interests of persons, as they test it the numerous *apresamientos *injustificados and #some even out of the economic zone scoop #moroccan.
proposes that the European and Chinese Union close a specific agreement of scientific and technical cooperation so as to increase and expand cooperation, #among others fields, in fields like energy, the environment, sciences of nature, sciences of materials, transport, the telematic, and technologies of information and the communication.
projection of these figures indicates that the #european industry invests surely among 20.000 and 10.000 millions of frames in efforts of investigation out of the European Union and #if it achieved to use credits that the European Union puts now to disposal for *movilizar also private resources in the field of investigation, #this #would contribute to that countries like Argentinian leave to be only extensions of the #european facilities to take part directly in investigation and the technological development.
Already posed the question and, very amiably, Speaker *me has given an answer that, without embargo, consider no adjusted to the Regulation, because #if the Regulation talks of a week, a week #can not understand like seven working days: seven days #can understand like natural or working and no like a week, to the equal that month or a year that, for example, #can not consider of 365 working days.
Besides, support totally the proposals of the speaker on the reduction of CO2 broadcasts, so that we reach the goals of *Kioto, #as well as the fiscal incentives for the technical adaptation of the most ancient vehicles and adaptation of proof cycles, so that they register the real broadcasts of vehicles in circulation, at least on a long-term basis.
In previous reports of the European Parliament already said that the big culture of car was the main manager of pollution of the air in *Europa, and Parliament exerts now an active paper in the establishment of the maximum values of the distinct *contaminantes to reach control of this environmental problem.
Create and expect, as, that Parliament #can, from this report, receive income especially through this reference #as well as through #others, and seen elements that #this contain, #one to a formal claim to authorise to the Conference *Intergubernamental to tackle at the same time reforms that *nos propose and to this fundamental look of the total participation of Parliament no only regarding costs" but also to income" of the budget of the Union.
Therefore, is urgent to unify this energetic debate with the purpose to determine exactly investment options and put #alto to contradictions that take that five members, at least, of the European Union -*Austria, #Italia, *Dinamarca, *Portugal and #Grecia- that do not resort to the nuclear energy, #would be forced to fund politics that is, in more of a 50%, still subsidised by the European Union in matter of nuclear energy.
Respect reasons by the that the #british delegation has abstained concerning the amendments *núms. 5 and 8 -auxiliary doctors-, but *yo have not followed line, because, in the first place, treats of a position negotiator and, second, my immediate familiar experience of #one *comadrona of the *SNS, overwhelmed by an excessive work, no *me allows to impose to a decisive medical personnel labour days longer of it absolutely necessary.
*Ello has caused that the current #greek authorities have taken a very important decision, specifically the nomination of a new direction, resorting to expert of companies -in concrete the *Speedway, subsidiary of *British *Airways- that they have to update reflation plan of company and that, am safe, will be able to *ofrecernos along month sufficient data and the necessary guarantees so that, once and for all, #can authorise the last tract of helps to *Olympic *Airways and reach that #this takeoff adequately and take flight without greater problems.
Has shown a big opening, which *nos has allowed to reach commitments, no in the sense of commitments that hide the positions that defend the different Groups, but that have struggled and have taken a true effort to achieve a #european commitment, a #european approach that express the general support to the position of the Council and of the Commission.
Thus it is indispensable that the Commission achieve harmonisation of tariffs and the elimination of beaks *arancelarios and of progression *arancelaria, #as well as the suppression of #all the technical barriers to trade, understanding that to the less developed countries *les has to guarantee the free access to the international market of #all products so that they #can benefit also *ellos of the commercial liberalisation.
To finish, also *yo want to congratulate to the speaker by his excellent report and by will to get to consensus it wider possible on a so important subject like the next Round of #Millenium, of the *cual depends the consolidation of a commercial system *equitativo that ensure, to world-wide level, an economic order based in the social justice.
adherents of liberalisation of trade whereas engine of prosperity are so much more reluctant to this balance in measure in that it is difficult to argue the aggravation of the situation in these last years with the reinforcement of inequalities among the countries with delay in development and the countries advanced, like development of inequalities in the same breast of the countries developed.
At present, in spite of the good work of the speakers, position proposal of Parliament runs the risk to be more conservative that the of the Commission, and the Group of the Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers European has presented varied amendments directed to centre the approach of the report and to accelerate development of #one *Europa parliamentary.
Nevertheless, the construction of #this *Europa do not involves to deprive to villages and to the homelands of the *margen of autonomy that *les allows to dominate his own destination, is to say, that only #can undertake #if it supports in respect of the national sovereignties, in adhesion of villages, in the social consensus and politician, in the opening and transparency of the processes and in respect of #all the integral countries.
Subject: Prohibition of supply of fuels and threat of humanitarian catastrophe in *Yugoslavia Is being very questioned and has given place to forceful reactions the opposition of the EU -manifested in the frame of the Council of Ministers of External Subjects celebrated in *Luxemburgo- to supply fuel and products of first need to the inhabitants of *Yugoslavia so that they #can confront the next winter, #as well as the final decision to supply oil, under lemma "Action for democracy", only to two #serbian populations, *Nis and *Pirot, controlled by the opposition.
But where is the protection of workers, in particular against drama of unemployment, even in the richest countries of the European Union, precisely #that that #would have *sobradamente means to eradicate unemployment, #if the main worry of governments did not go gains of the great companies and enrichment of owners and shareholders?
The public and social services, like education or health, and also #that in the that are in game security of users and the collective interest, like the public transports or the aerial control, culture and the artistic creation, #can not subject to the balances of a commercial negotiation.
Given the existence of the international agreement reached by means of the Extraordinary Assembly of Nation Organisation Joined in June of 1998, for treatment balanced of the problem, so much in slope of decrease of offer, as in slope of decrease of demand, wanted to underline the possibilities that offers the new Treaty in article 152.
Gentleman Newton *Dunn, as *nosotros are of the opinion that in the weighting of proposal, by it other #worthy of attention, and of the intention that the Presidency #german of the Council had in moment, *nos remain with the that aspires to a wider goal, will refuse amendments, and no only those referred to the legal base, but #all #that that do not alter the fact that *usted has made an accurate work.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0054\/99) of Mr. *Seppänen in name of Budget Commission on the proposed decision of the Council by the that concedes to the European Bank of Investments guarantee of the Community to absorb the losses that derive of loans for project realisation of reconstruction of the zones affected by the earthquake in *Turquía.
Serve of example prevention group of *estupefacientes, that acts in breast of Investigation Centre and Development in the sanitary and social sector of *Finlandia, #as well as the group *Pompidou, group of cooperation of the Council of *Europa created in the decade of the 70 by initiative of President of *Francia for the fight against drug addiction and that has slopes projects for the reduction of offer and demand of *estupefacientes.
Believe that have the obligation bear with our *conciudadanos -and talk to Speaker in exercise of the Council of a #nordic country that always takes #gala of transparency- to reach a transparent process in the that, in the first place, Parliament was properly represented and *me #would enjoy that Speaker denied voices that say that the Presidency *opone to a full representation of Parliament in the Conference *Intergubernamental with two representatives.
Gentleman President, Speaker in exercise of the Council affirms that it always enjoys *cuando attends to Parliament, therefore it results quite extraordinary that in intervention have not answered to #any of the proposals of Parliament for the Conference *Intergubernamental, it that comes to confirm #news appeared in the press, that are reason of worry, that the European Council has chosen an agenda restricted for the *CIG and that the Letter is only *optativa.
During 1998 and 1999 with the approval of programs of the Commission of the European Parliament through work group *interinstitucional, *Turquía received bottoms inside Program *Meda and the Commission of Budgetary Control has approved the creation of work group during the debate of the budget of the year 2000.
*Yo particularly think -and had occasion to say it in the debate that kept in the month of October- that, for the first time, #all pieces of puzzle #turkish find on the table: the problem of the islands of the Sea *Egeo, the problem of *Chipre, the problem of the human rights and the problem of minorities.
In consequence, *nos seems timely that in occasion give another very clear signal that the preservation of the human rights and the protection of minorities in *Turquía follows being the essential condition so that the European Parliament express solidarity from sight point of cooperation and of support to country.
In spite of the diverse political initiatives directed to reduce pollution and improve the quality of the air, splits of the base that transport needs of *pasajeros will go back to increase drastically in the next ten years and the number of vehicles will increase in a 25%, it that will suppose a still greater charge for the quality of the air.
elements of said strategy are an agreement with the car industry on the reduction of CO2 broadcasts inside term *preestablecido and labeling system that indicate fuel consumption and facilitate the election of consumer in moment of purchase of a new tourism.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, as it indicates the speaker, Mrs. #Carmen *Fraga *Estévez, the presentation of the proposal of the new regulation of the Council by the that it establishes the Common Organisation of the Market in the sector of products of fishing and aquaculture produces in moment in the that #all the countries of the European Union constitute #one of the greater world-wide markets of products *pesqueros.
Perhaps these demonstrations served of pretext to the official protagonists of the Summit -#that that seated of plenary right around work table- not to assume until bottom the political responsibility of some certainly difficult negotiations but extremely necessary in matter of social rights and of protection of health of citizens, negotiations that no longer #can expect.
#That is reason by the that the budget of this year had to reflect in truth the need to reinforce the procedures of budgetary control and, like speaker of the budget for 2000 and in name of the Commission of Budgetary Control, wanted to receive with *beneplácito once again the creation of a new organ to struggle against fraud and the new places of the *OLAF reflected in the budget for this year.
Subject: Publication of compliance with article 5 of the Regulation 19\/65\/*CEE of the Council of 2 March 1965 Has taken into account the Commission the specificity and diversity of the sector of hospitality industry in *Bélgica, *afamado by the big quantity of bars friendly in the that they serve beers of the most diverse classes, and the repercussions of the application of reference Regulation especially among the small employers of the sector that will see affected?
Sure enough, there #be a *desfase remarkable among the noisy proclamations of the Union on wish to exert a more offensive paper in the solution of the great international problems, by part; and by #another, dealer discussions of carpets to the that have had to *entregarnos with the representatives of the governments *cuando treats to look for finance for new priorities.
Without embargo, have to say that, to the contrary of it that *sucede in the national field, in *Europa have observed that the practical politics develops above the parties and, in front of the material problems, the European Parliament is conscious of responsibility, that of course increased and happened to occupy place even more stood out to sight of the low participation in the #european elections.
#Such as it establishes article 35 of Regulation, the Commission of Budgetary Control, competent for this matter, listened and interrogated individually to candidates proposed days 22. and 23 November 1999. In said audiences, *nos guide, on the one hand, by disposals of the Treaty, that demand that candidates form part or have formed part in the past of control organ of accounts or are especially qualified for the exercise of said charge.
From sight point of the countries in development, the important questions are the creation of conditions to develop capacity to register pollution indexes and development of performance capacities in general, #as well as the promotion of technology transfer.
. (IN) In the first place, wanted to recognise, to the equal that am safe that it recognises #all Parliament, paper that has exerted the distinguished deputy Mr. *Soares no only in the restoration of democracy, the human dignity and the human rights in #one of the great countries of *Europa, but also the historical paper that has exerted at the end of the empire and in the conclusion of an empire with #all #decorum that has been possible, without forgetting *Macao.
The second problem is, definitely, the most important: although it mentions in the preamble, this text no answers to an essential problem, *cual is investigation directed to illnesses that are not little frequent, but concerning the *cuales no exists market for the pharmaceutical industry, in particular illnesses that affect to populations that #can not pay treatment: treats, especially, of the tropical illnesses, even of malaria and of tuberculosis.
Whereas the previous rounds carried out inside the greater discretion, among negotiators *sagaces and taking into account only the commercial interests of country, the next round, #whose date of start is up to now unknown, only will be able to make in transparency and integrating in the debates #all the questions linked with trade, to know: the social norms, the environment, the protection of consumers, culture.
Subject: Granting of humanitarian help to Serbian Has the Council the intention to undertake initiatives directed to send humanitarian help to village #serbian, now that winter is in doors, since the maintenance of the embargo -on the that has manifested reservations even the coordinator of the Stability Pact, Mr. *Bodo *Hombach- affects to village #serbian in greater measure that to diet of *Milosevic?
Of here that it value very positively the Report *Murphy and that it have voted in favour of #the same by what said report introduces again looks that the Council had deleted when elaborating his common position, but that represent an unquestionable benefit for #SME, in particular the obligation to fix by law the establishment of some same terms of collection in the commercial transactions and the that this obligation *incumba also to the public powers.
Given the importance of tourism, by part, regarding the creation of places of work and, by #another, regarding diffusion of the #european culture and taking into account the constant postponement of the approval of program in question by part of the Council of Ministers of Tourism, #can indicate the Council for when has foreseen the definite approval of program?
Create also that it is necessary to elaborate and draft this code of fine administrative behaviour that #would help so much to Request Commission as to Defender of Village in work. Help to Defender of Village and to Request Commission in work is not more that help to that the #european construction was more credible for the #european citizens.
Is by #this that, giving follow-up to the investigation of initiative carried out by Defender of Village on infringement procedures, the Commission has engaged to facilitate, in moment in that it informs to the author of complaint of intention of *archivarla -*cuando #this is the intention- also reasons by the that estimates that no exists violation of the community Right.
*Me give account that politics and the Institutions have to involve in the situations that produce and, by #this, when confirming trial on conflict, back any initiative directed to find a positive solution from the point of political sight, ethical and juridical, entrusting especially in paper that the UN, the European Union, NATO and *Rusia #can and have to exert.
Affirm that it gave deal to Nations Joined because two permanent members of the Security Council blocked action of NATO (#such as have right to take basing in the statute of the UN...), is monument to arbitrariness and a dangerous sample of totalitarian logic, is to say, *acaso Nations Joined are only useful *cuando agree with NATO?
*Me cheer especially that, in spite of hit that has suffered lately the Commission -although Mr. Commissioner is above #all history- do not have ceased to boost this so useful work in the sector of the financial services.
*Me upset the words of Mr. *Prodi, that seems more concerned for respecting the tradition of bulimia of power of the Commission, that for clearing how this last will apply the principles of prevention and of just trade (on the *cuales the next President of the Commission *calla) during the commercial negotiations in the that goes to represent the interests of States members.
Gentleman President, the title sounds very promising, but, to trial, the greater misfortune that suffer the greater persons in this moment -*yo *me include among *ellos- is the resignation of the Commission, since, as a result of *ella, the proposals of Commissioner *Monti to elaborate a directive allocated to liberalise the market of pension bottoms will remain in inkwell by long.
Identify also like signals of identity of a progressive politics the protection of the environment integrated in #all the community politics and the review of the ceiling of the own resources in the financial perspectives of Diary 2000, #as well as the maintenance of the internal solidarity of the Union through Bottoms structural and of cohesion.
Have initiated this path: has begun shyly the path of harmonisation of the economic politics; Mr. Commissioner *Monti has elaborated project for harmonisation of the fiscal politics that will have to be approved, and in the next European Council of Colony will tackle the subject of the European Pact by Employment.
These agreements, for the time being, more that liberalisation have caused concentration of the market in hands of some #few multinationals that have imposed control system *monopolístico; after the agreements *GATT have not fulfilled protection clauses of the environment, of health, ethical and of defence of the most disadvantaged villages of the world.
Also support the request by part of the investment speaker public\/private to achieve a modern infrastructure of transports and communications in the Union and also request to the Commission and to the Council so that they find the mechanism of appropriate finance, as, for example, enlargement of paper of the *BEI.
#alto solution fire that do not regulate unambiguously look will not be able to achieve, to my seem, a true #alto fire. The return of refugees has to go accompanied, in effect, of the deployment of peace strength solid with a strong participation of NATO, but also of neutral countries, of *Rusia and of countries.
To the encourage the secession of the #Kosovar of #albanian tongue, that no always have been *exentos of exactions, justifies with hindsight precisely *aquello that wanted to condemn and, in particular, to the Government of *Milosevic, because although claims #albanian on *Kosovo are legitimate in name of the rights of an ethnic majority, in this case *Milosevic has foundation to demand for Serbian annexation of the *Krajina Croat, populated in his majority by #serbian, or annexation of part of *Bosnia, equally populated in part by #serbian.
Believe that the crisis of *Kosovo shows to #that that did not want to recognise it that need a ministry and Subject minister External, a ministry and Defence minister and Security, and that already is hour that it endow to *Europa of the necessary instruments to reach said goal in ten or fifteen years, as *Europa knew to take it takes ten or fifteen years in the case of the Economic and Monetary Union.
But will be necessary the improvement of the judicial system, of the public administration, of the strengths of police and of the regional authorities by means of training, support to reforms, the strengthening of relations among the political means Europeans and Russians, #as well as of support to the *ONG and to the independent social media.
Inside the socialist Group there #be the one who thinks that yes there #be a reasonable base of negotiation and that it is *eso it that we have to take. No only by the media, no only by the public opinion, no only by the constituents, but to be in peace with *nosotros same and show that *cuando talk in name of villages of *Europa, in name of the democratic constituents, have a minimum affinity with the common persons and that we have to put end to a series of practices, what before, better.
The want to have available, anyway, before the first reading of the European Parliament, because #if we #would not be in hands of the Council, *cuando treat of the additional means that will put really to disposal for category 5. Because #if notification gets after the first reading by part of Parliament, then only will be able to make rectification #if parts of Budget Authority, or was the Council and Parliament, approve it.
Second: in this statutory page of a report that never have signed, puts that today in the meeting, on 4 May President of the European Parliament has announced confirmation of the common position and that has transacted this common position to transport Commission and Tourism, like corresponding commission.
#If it takes into account that in the year 1998 the natural called «disasters» -*yo no the #would consider always natural- have caused 50.000 dead persons and 12, 4 trillions of pesetas in losses (floods, fires, hurricanes -like the *Mitch- or environmental catastrophes -always memory *Doñana, that follows *coleando and with problems-) has taken indispensable that the organisations of civil protection play an important paper in each #one of these disasters, especially #if said organisations work well, his integral are very formed and at the same time form part of a network of community cooperation.
goal is to offer, on the one hand, commitment among having uniform requirements and, by #another, facilitate access of the European Union to the world-wide markets approximating the industrial specifications of the European Union to the widest requirements established in the Regulation of 1995 of the Economic Commission for *Europa of Nations Joined.
Has chaired during #one of the most extraordinary periods of history of the European Union and of life of Parliament, as *usted same has said in intervention: splitting of the Conference *Intergubernamental, happening by the introduction of the euro and until the unexpected process of ratification of the new Commission, of the that also *nos have occupied, although it was not in the calendar neither expected to take it.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, in Congress of The Have in 1998, the #european movement regretted that the Union seemed today condemned to advance in a big conceptual gap and appeared *desprovista of any political perspective, precisely in moment in that it is to the two great adventures of history: coin only and enlargement.
Believe that it is important to stand out that the structural Bottoms, with his downward profile of costs, represent an important contribution to the consolidation of the budget. guarantees the community solidarity to the highest level of the last period of helps, is to say, help level of 1999 for structure regions feebler.
In moment voted in favour of the investiture of #Jacques *Santer for the Presidency of the Commission, considering that it had been Prime minister of a small country like the #mine, but much less affected by immigration *extraeuropea, by unemployment and by taxes, giving #alert voice for having accepted at the front of the different departments to the worst and to the best.
Underline also the importance that President Roman *Prodi attributes to the #mediterranean politics, that plants in a similar plane to the of enlargement to the SIN, will to contribute to a greater dynamism of the #european economy and to a reduction of unemployment and, thing for *nosotros essential, defence of the economic and social cohesion.
And it that it is more important, for me personally, the jewel of crown reached as a result of the informal negotiations back to *Berlín in *Estrasburgo was that the Council gave approval to appeal of the European Parliament to modify the decision of the Summit of *Berlín to add a new initiative *URBAN with the 0, 35 % of bottoms added to batch community.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, lady Commissioner, gentleman Commissioner, the repercussions of the basic agreement on the agricultural reform «Diary 2000» on agriculture in the European Union and on the agricultural incomes, are less negative that in the primitive proposals of the Commission since price reductions have resulted lower in cereals and meat of *vacuno.
Subject: Free circulation of persons in the EU So as to prevent participation in demonstration (authorised) on 27 March in #París, the #french authorities blocked to 3000 Italians in border the night of 26 March. This grave fact violates the right of demonstration and freedom of circulation in the European Union
For example, a proposal to fund measure with charge to the *IFOP for the regions of the Goal 1 and 2 but with charge to guarantee sector of the *FEOGA for other regions #can not encourage more that bottom «hunting», in the that companies of the sector *pesquero #can go back to establish in the Community with the simple goal to endorse bottoms for a determined project.
The bad news is that an overwhelming majority of the commission has criticised and even has protested with vehemence against form and method in that said decisions and disposals have seen the light. Expect that this Assembly add to complaints, since *revisten a special importance in it that to the parliamentary control and the *codecisión of Parliament in the field of the inner security refers.
On the other hand, wanted to signal that as a result of this behaviour of the Council arises once again doubt of #if theory of the *legitimación indirect of the Council like legislator in terrains so crucial follow being sustainable to these heights. As no only the European Parliament proceeds to the debate without having of the corresponding documentation, no only the European Parliament remains to the *margen of the decisions and the *preparativos of the Council, but that have proof that also the national Parliaments are informed late and badly.
is not correct, in the first place, because no exists absolute majority, as *usted same had signalled it on purpose of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 17 July 1998 on the external politics and of common security, agreement to the that *yo *me had opposite together with my Group; and, second, is not correct because no exists any type of ratification by the national Parliaments of texts that add, modify or complete the Treaties, often of substantial way.
In effect, the amendments incorporated to the proposal of the Commission, and that the Council affirms to be had to accept, improve noticeably access to information on procedures of community decision too much secret, well treat of the committees, of the documents that argue, of the agendas, of the list of participants, or well -even-of the calendar of works of the committees.
On this false base, the resolution of the European Parliament, that tackles especially the preparatory works of the future reform, proposes that the Commission initiate -and afterwards direct- the process, and that, without abandoning his supposed political responsibility, entrust the editorial of a *primer document to expert group, formula that already used in the preparation of *Maastricht.
But want to signal that placing of #all the process of electoral query under responsibility of the Security Council of Nations Joined will force necessarily to strength intervention of appropriate security, #if Indonesian did not fulfils with duty to disarm to militias and watch by that the process pass without interference of the terrorist groups and armed.
Have had the honour to take part this week in three occasions, in my last apparition in front of Parliament, to talk about freedom and of peace in *Kosovo, in favour of efforts of the EU in fight against death pity and in favour of a court for war crimes.
And with arrangement to this opinion and had account that Mr. *Anwar #Ibrahim already has happened almost seven months in prison without having the possibility to resort to bail, the Commission considers that the process, that appeal of lawyers of defence already announced, has to carry out with arrangement to the criteria accepted internationally to consider trial like just.
A high level of nuclear security is a priority of adhesion process, and the Commission is had to cooperate with #all States candidates to help to improve the nuclear security, guaranteeing that the levels of technological security and of operation adjust to practices, at present valid in the Union in matter of security.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0226\/99) of Mrs. *Lulling, for the Delegation of Parliament in the Conciliation Committee, on the Regulation (*CE) of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to statistics of sake exchanges among States members so as to reduce data that have to provide (3608\/99 - *C4-0172\/99-97\/0155(*COD))
Thus *le invite to that, of compliance with article 38 of the Regulation (statements to explain decisions of the Commission), ask to the Commission, *cuando finish the agenda of today, that avenges to this hemicycle to explain the decision that took yesterday to impose to the French Federation of Football fine by quantity *irrisoria of 650 pounds by a clear violation of the community norms.
To #all #that that are in favour of a politics of preventive peace -on it that exists a wide consensus in the national Parliaments and in the European Parliament- by #everything it that has not reached *Dayton -it that did not supposes criticism to *Dayton, as probably then no existed another possibility-, want *decirles that approach strategy on a long-term basis for the *Sudeste of *Europa to the *Europa of integration to integrate to continuation really in *ella, has converted now in operative politics.
Regarding party considerations, is evident that the Commission has to represent the great political strengths of the European Union and that in level of Parliament will have to follow practising with #all the great Groups -and no treats only of two Groups- a politics of necessary cooperation to carry to term our legislative work.
Suffice to remember paper that had Mr. *Bangemann in the proposal reviewed of the Commission on author rights and society of information, pressures that carried out #Telephone to introduce changes in directive proposal previously refused by Parliament, the active politics of #Telephone of face to achieve penetrate in means, and even in relation with rates.
Also #would say that Mr. *Kreissl-*Dörfler had reason in insisting, together with Mr. *Duff -in a *primer speech very interesting-in that #if #all the institutions do not show the highest levels of *rectitud for himself\/hisself same, and by himself\/hisself same, the criteria will be imposed from out, well in form of punishment by part of the public opinion, in principle by means of apathy and *desinterés, but perhaps of other more direct ways, also political, or well that the Council assume responsibility that #others do not seem to be had to show.
Therefore, believe that the Commission has applied wrongly article 82 of the Treaty, because in this case no treated to take advantage of *abusivamente of a dominant position, but to benefit , of an absolutely just and comprehensible way, of a very particular situation from the point of fiscal sight.
First, the Committee of Independent Experts recognises that, although the last responsibility of the management *recae in the Commission, no fits to ignore that the administrations of States members execute at least the 80% of the community budget and that attitude in front of fraud is not always diligent although afterwards ministers are the that *despotriquen against the community management.
Also with regard to #this, to my opinion, *nos find in front of a true fraud, because undress of authority to the free will of persons that organise on the base of article of the Regulation, is not an act of democracy and of freedom; before well, #if deputy thought that act has inspired only in it that it is the economic budget of the groups and of assistants, then *nos find in front of an authentic case of fraud.
But the question that it #would be necessary to take is #if it will not have got moment that, #if the European Community wants to have protected sure enough his financial interests, exist a penal community Right that allow to configure like community offence, with a competent penal jurisdiction, fraud against the financial interests of the Community.
In *tercer place, #if the Agriculture Commissioner designated also loans greater attention to the amendments presented by Parliament and to the own members of parliament, always that #that, just is to say it, no *rebasen the budgetary limits and do not derogate juridical acts already existent, the majority opinion of my Group is that experience, competition and commitment of candidate allow to conclude that it will make a fine work like member of the Commission.
Without embargo, part of group do not expects of the Commission an ecological approach in performances, and from now on #all group will commission that the Commission respect the principle of sustainable development and make possible the creation of a *Europa of citizens, so that goals are always present to hour to take decisions.
The Ministers of Justice and Inner will elaborate the subjects of competition in an unofficial meeting that will celebrate in *Turku days 16 and 17 September, and the Council of General Subjects began the *preparativos of the European Council in a meeting that took place the past Monday, for *cerrarlos definitively in meeting of the 11 to 12 October.
report (To5-0013) of Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence, on regulation proposal of the Council (*COM(1999)312 - *C5-0062\/1999 - 1999\/0123(*CNS)) by the that it modifies the Regulation (*CE) *nº 1628\/1996, of 25 July 1996, relative to help to *Bosnia and *Herzegovina, *Croacia, the Federative Republic of *Yugoslavia and the ancient Yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia and, especially, by the that it creates the European Agency of Reconstruction
Inform (To5-0013\/99) of Mrs. *Pack, in name of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence, on Regulation proposal (*CE) of the Council (*COM(1999) 312 - *C5-0062\/1999 - 1999\/0132(*CNS)) relative to the modification of the Regulation (*CE) 1628\/96 relative to help to *Bosnia-*Herzegovina, *Croacia, Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia and to the ancient #yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia, mainly by the creation of a European Agency of Reconstruction
In *tercer place, in terms of economic support and support to development, commitment of the Commission in the frame of the Agreement of *Lomé #can and #would have to be reactivated with two conditions: in the first place, an improvement of the situation of security in the *RDC and, second, a result of the national debate that guarantee a stable political disposal in the *RDC and in the that respect the fundamental elements of the Agreement of *Lomé.
Of the recent past and of his *productivismo *descabellado inherit a situation that, in the common agricultural field - with *demasiada frequency -, has put politics to service of the great economic groups *agroalimentarios and of distribution on a large scale. Result: crazy cows, chickens that poison "to dioxin" , oil of casting in oil for consumption, muds of purification in flours for livestock, and do not quote more...
*Algo very distinct to Big *Bretaña: has not produced eradication of illness and animal tax ailing situates still in a level too much elevated for avert any risk of pollution and to guarantee to consumers a healthy product.
will Have to organise, therefore, a big conference on AIDS, but without *dejarla only in hands of the countries that afterwards have to manage specifically some so dramatic consequences, but a conference, as *auguramos from takes years, in 1993, on pandemias, AIDS, that under responsibility face up to this situation and arbitrate measures that correspond to an international authority, to sight that the WHO is totally unable to offer concrete answers.
The answer of Parliament in form elaborated by Budget Commission is that it important in this stage is to review the financial perspectives and of form ensure also in fact the arrival to destination of the general assistance given by Parliament and by the European Union #as well as the possibility to carry to good term these subjects.
help to payment scales is help to reinforce reservations of a country of form that #can face up to problems of external payments, that always have compensation: always pays or by provision of service or by the acquisition of commodity.
Thus, give my approval, of course, to the amendments presented by gentleman *Langen that demand of the Commission a more active paper to boost promotion strategy coordinated in breast of States members #as well as to develop the potential of *Europa in export of the relative technologies to the renewable energies.
The technical advances of the last years have improved clearly efficiency of sources of renewable energy, and in place to allocate *tantos resources to the atomic industry #european, as obviously it takes the Commission, owe *redoblarse efforts for promoting sources of renewable energy.
The *primer moment of *apogeo of this process of democratisation were the democratic elections of 1994, the first celebrated for #all the #south african, that constituted a visible expression of the release no only of the majority of the population until then *oprimida, but in reality also, create *yo, of the privileged by the ancient system; of release of pressure *autoimpuesta of having to justify a system that *ellos same knew, at least in his *fuero internal, that was *injustificable and that also *les was *distanciando progressively of persons of *Europa and *Norteamérica with the that felt cultural and ethnically identified.
#There is chapters like tax on value added that require harmonisation because, of it contrary, #would distort competition; likewise exist chapters, to know, society tax and tax on performances of the capital furniture that, by the contrary, have to be harmonised in part in that harmonisation fault involves distortion of competition.
The one who do not recognise now that has got hour of the truth neither recognise that it has to give a clear and sincere answer to *Turquía, will run the risk that it do not reach all *aquello that want of *Turquía but that produce a very different evolution of the that we will be also responsible in the case that *Turquía do not look for already the path to family of the community of democratic values in *Europa but in any #another spot.
Finally, do not leaves to be, definitely, interesting observe that cooperation that seals of way with this big country of the South #can contribute to the creation of synergistic effects useful for the European Union in the frame of the delicate negotiations that go to initiate in breast of the *OMC, from the Conference of *Seattle of the next month of November.
In effect, control fault on our part #would have dramatic consequences for society, gravely affected by unemployment (40% of the active population) and #would go totally against of efforts that the European Union makes from takes years, through the structural Bottoms, to favour the economic and social development of the island.
But not even have value of #Emma *Tuahepa, the one who has brave to ask to the #african governments it that had taken and it that are with money of the #african, and it only that *ustedes have limited to signal is that #any of the eleven Bosses of #african State *dignó to assist to the Conference, or the importance of the cultural and religious factors in the propagation of plague.
Think, for example, in an excessive *enfatización of the clauses of social protection, of the *dumping social there #where knows perfectly that #this will be mere *declamaciones after the *cuales no will have swim more not even effective controls and that, in fact, only will be the sword of #Damocles protectionist for the countries in development, for the countries of recent industrialisation, that will be able to be used *cuando the old *Europa, the old *Europa of bureaucracies, of the #sindical bureaucracies and of the industrial decadence, will find with water to the neck.
The 25 May 1999 the agreement was signed by President of Parliament, Mr. #Gil-Oaks, President of the Council and President of the Commission; the Council and the Commission adopted on 25 May and on 2 June, respectively, the timely decisions of competition with seen to the application of the agreement in breast of said Institutions.
#would Be suicidal, *contrariamente to it that #some have affirmed today, think that the #european rulers #can exert pressures so that the Central Bank *supla inability to reactivate the economy through the structural reforms, liberalisation of the markets, before #all the of work, and the budgetary rigour that it has to go accompanied of a reduction of the fiscal charge on persons and companies.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Central Bank European, *Señorías, this debate celebrates *cuando have fulfilled the first nine months of life of the euro, in conditions that allow to ensure that introduction has been hit, although it only was in the sense limited that the transition to the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union has produced without greater *sobresaltos.
Another big difference is that it is very easy to try take a false note with modern technicians of photocopied it that constitutes reason by the that the precise details of notes go to be given to know amply but only little before introduction to reduce the risk of fake and not confusing to the public that is not even familiarised with notes.
Group will take use of #all means to scope to influence in the community budgets so that they believe the bases of a #european bottom for refugee; subject #this, that now only went object of quotation in the decisions of the Council, urging to the Commission to study the possibility to " consider the creation of *algún bottom of reservation for situations, in the that great groups of refugees need temporary protection."
A strong signal of *Tampere that *Europa has left to be only a market and that the #european citizen no longer is only consumer and worker; that citizen, whereas citizen, with #all dimensions, with #all worries, with #all needs, with #all demands, is in the centre of the #european construction.
In occasion will have to give a clear signal so that the preparation process of the Letter and the Conference *Intergubernamental of the Union, that will develop simultaneously, express two convergent dynamics, with seen to guarantee enlargement conditions and strengthen the foundations of right State in right Union.
Still do not circulate notes of the #european coin and, watches by where, already talked in June, in Colony, of a #european army and, in September, in *Tampere, of a #european penal justice, is a Letter of Fundamental Rights and, finally and especially, the Commission asks to the European Council that accept the perspective of a *Europa expanded until the #Asia Lower and until the western borders of the *Irak and of the will Go.
Report (To5-0021\/1999) of Mr. *Hatzidakis, in name of the Commission of Regional Politics, Transports and Tourism, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Repercussions of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course in the field of the regional politics, of transports and of tourism (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219\/1999)
Have to confess -already with #any experience in relations among the European Parliament and Congress of States Joined- that in Congress of States Joined have friends and speakers, but that have not been able to board in moment a positive debate with senator *Helms, that seems that it do not has not even of North American passport and that considers, no only in this subject but in #others #many, that *él is the that imposes law to the world.
Gentleman President, wish to support program Culture 2000 and congratulate to the speaker, the Basque Mr. *Graça *Moura, for having enriched the group of the text with new contributions directed, by part, to achieve greater participation of the countries and of the *beneficiarios and, by #another, to insist on the need to diversify the announcements, #as well as with recommendations in defence of deconcentration of activities and great cultural events.
More specifically, regarding the agricultural chapter of the budget, is evident that even before they begin negotiations *multilaterales of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the EU proposes to coordinate with the North American the reduction of the protection and of interventions, by means of the reduction of resources allocated to the different agricultural products, fact that comports new reductions in income of producers and new limitations to crops.
The Managerial Committee European Scientist has to pronounce on the relevance of the #french arguments since Monday, the group *ad *hoc that gathers to the #european specialists of illnesses of *priones has not been able to get to an unanimous conclusion and has transmitted to the Scientific Committee European the results of works.
#would Suit *conmigo in that the relative situation to meat of bovine has contributed now, in front of the public opinion, to create chaos regarding the *aceptabilidad of trials issued in the #european level on the *inocuidad of foods and that *eso no presages at all good for the plan of Mr. *Prodi to create a #european agency of alimentary security?
#If #this do not locate and are not recognised like the real causes of the problems to the that they confront workers of the sea, #can not talk neither of measures neither of the creation of mechanisms of control, for example of rest of workers of the sea, that only #can give of ineffective form and *hipócrita, perpetuating like this intensification diet of work and of exploitation.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0049\/1999) of Mr. *Gahrton, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the Council by the that celebrates Agreement of scientific cooperation and technical among the European Community and the Popular Republic of Chinese [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0287<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0038<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1999<num>$/^0123<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0045\/1999) of Mr. *Linkohr, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the Council [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^99<num>$^)<rpar>$ ^0292<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0040<num>$/^99<num>$ - ^99<num>$/^0125<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> by the that celebrates Agreement of scientific cooperation and technical among the European Community and the Argentinian Republic.
In the main document *nos likes in particular -as to #others- the insistence in the need of a coherent approach of regulation of network Internet and of the electronic trade and also in the intellectual property, sale to distance and data protection, looks collected, #all *ellos, to protect the rights of consumers and guarantee suitable norms of feasibility.
Therefore, the goals consist, first, in establishing in #all the European Union and in #all the countries applicants, networks of communication among the organisations that occupy to struggle against violence exerted on women and boys, as these organisations are the that know the field; second, in creating consciousness among #all Europeans about nature of this bad and of the need to eradicate it and to allocate bottoms to *ello.
In this report underlined also the need that we promoted the celebration of an exceptional European Council on the future of politics familiar and of protection of infancy in the European Union, and that it presented to Parliament a comparative annual report of legislations of countries in this subject.
Regarding the amendments, have to say that the European Commission has accepted fully nine, has accepted 7 of *ellas of entrance; but have not advanced more and #would want to explain why: During the Presidency #finnish, that as *ustedes know is responsible to boost the complementary directives and planning of semester, gave a strategic option that had communicated to Employment Commission and Social Subjects.
#If there #be not resulted until finals of year, my intention is, in the Presidency #portuguese, introduce strategy change, a distinct approximation to the problem and a base of distinct negotiations, to boost said managerial with steps faster and, explaining already with a first reaction of the Council, that the Commission advance in the new approximation, that #would say that it is *algo easy.
More that some words, #would want simply ask, like witness alas very near, that further of the message of compassion -and is truth that families of the victims will appreciate it- #can, in quality of European Parliament, initiate solidarity procedure by means of helps that #can attribute to this region of the big South so *duramente affected, in favour of families, first, and afterwards of #that that have lost it all, without embargo also in it that touches to the economic instrument that has remained destroyed.
Share also sight point that a just configuration of the budget #can not make exclusively in side of income of the budget and share also the opinion that no it is necessary to expect until the year 2006 to keep a debate on reform but that it has to make with support inside term of office period.
Also signals in this resolution -and is perhaps the most important point, section 4- that ask Plenary that approve the decision to increase the amount of budget project *rectificativo and supplementary 5\/99 in 25 millions in credits of payment allocated to program *PHARE, in consonance, lady *Schreyer, with the urgent needs of program that *nos has signalled the Commission.
In *Europa have to take our contribution and give good example to the rest of the world, even recognising that the greater pressure for the energetic consumption in the future will owe to countries like States Joined, that is quite *despilfarrador in energy consumption, and also to the countries in development that, to measure that economies grow and increase level of life, go to need a greater energetic consumption, that probably will proceed of sources of energy quite *contaminantes.
The unitary confrontation of the #european citizens on the familiar differences and the questions that accompany to custody of boys in case of divorce is clear that go to avert to thousands of families tiredness and complications with bureaucracy and also will reinforce security feeling and of confidence of citizens in the European Union.
These two instruments constitute #one of the first stones of the community building that are, #whose fundamental goal is the to offer to #all citizens and to the juridical agents of the Union an easier access, faster and more effective to justice like *salvaguardia of the norms of juridical security.
Subject: Application of the directive on nitrates Is conscious the Commission (and are it in particular the responsible commissioners of environment and agriculture) that the #european directive on nitrates (91\/676\/*CEE) do not offers absolute guarantees by it that refers to the quality of the subterranean waters, seen that the directive centres in nitrates pertinent of *abonos of animal origin, leaving like this sideways nitrate sources?
do not try to hide the military dimension of security, but #where more hurts is, to trial, in this continuous strategy to see *obnubilada by the military look in detriment of politics *paneuropea of prevention of conflicts that was to measure of tensions and fractures of the cold #postwar period in our continent.
Have heard with relief this morning position taking very firm of gentleman #Solana on this subject and commitment that has assumed to exert #all influence this afternoon in *Estambul so that in this territory respect the international right and the of persons, and with relief finish of *oírle say, gentleman Commissioner *Patten, that will go immediately to add on terrain efforts to the of gentleman #Solana.
Takes fault a European Parliament general legislator of the Union, like the Council, that take part of plenary right in the designation of members of the Institutions and able to establish confidence relation with the European Commission that no longer will see weakened by the double majority qualified today necessary for censorship motion.
Demand that have true capacity of decision in it referred to the fundamental looks of the common politics of fishing and base regulations, for example in the field of the organisation of the market, the conservation and exploitation of resources *pesqueros, control measures and the instruments of the structural politics. #This calls *codecisión of Parliament.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0066\/1999) of Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by Fight Office against Fraud (*OLAF).
#One, speaker of the Commission of Budgetary Control, Mrs. *Theato, that is a bit mother of the *OLAF and of #all this regulation; the #another, to the that consider father of the current regulation, is Mr. *Napolitano, that has had a big *mesura, a big intelligence and, especially, prowess to hour to confront a difficult solution.
#would Have to be compulsory that had a greater coherence among norms that govern trade, work, the environment, the animal welfare and other norms of international acceptance and the principles of the "fine management of societies" by means of a better cooperation among the *OMC, the *OIT, Nations Joined, the agreements *multilaterales environmental and other international institutions.
#Such as it had required it president *Pasqua during the general debate that took place in Plenary at the beginning of October, and as it finishes to remember it *pertinentemente my colleague #Georges *Berthu, before initiating a new cycle of negotiations is indispensable to make a clear and precise balance, goal, therefore independent and contradictory, with the end to perceive the economic consequences, social, environmental and of alimentary security of the previous agreements of the Round *Uruguay.
Under the threat of delay of enlargement or even of the dissolution of the Union, by his own creators, in the attempt, without rules neither laws, for conquering new markets and deliver the booty, capital *monopolista treats to surpass his internal contradictions, that were and follow being important, with #such to serve to the common interest of *sobreexplotar to workers and obtain the maximum benefit.
In spite of the positive measures that adopted after the resolution of Parliament, in the past day 16 September, in particular the entrance of the international strength of peace and security with the *égida of Nations Joined, the *INTERFET, the situation in matter of humanitarian security follow being grave so much in the territory of *Timor Oriental, #where is essential that get means to support reconstruction, as in the case of the wall of 250.000 displaced by force to Indonesian, in particular to the western part of *Timor.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, seism succession that have seeded the destruction in northwest of *Turquía *nos has moved to consider essential the reinforcement of assignments for country and, therefore, vote *favorablemente, in first reading, a review of the financial perspectives that establishes emergency support to *Turquía, to pair with the priority that concede to reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
In accordance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0053\/1999) of Mr. *Medina *Ortega, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market, on regulation proposal (*CE) of the Council by the that it modifies the Regulation (*CEE) *nº 1911\/91 relative to the application of disposals of the community Right in the Canarian islands (*COM(1999) 0226 - *C5-0127\/1999 - 19990111(*CNS))
Have known that an American dockyard -that did not build ships from took more of forty years- has received commission to build two transatlantic fuselages allocated to communication service of the islands *Hawai, since the American law reservation to dockyards of country the construction of crafts that make inner transports.
Although it has decided to renounce openly to dockyards, the most recent events in *Corea of the South #can conduct to that in the Union begin to confuse the old forms of support to dockyards and measures of the guidelines of1997 #whose goal is not competition politics, but simply the of politics according to the doctrine of the stable development and of *safety *of *the are.
Also have tried to convince to the aspiring countries of the importance of these subjects *diciéndoles that, although no #all the subjects are in the negotiation list, #can be that #this wake up so much interest in Parliaments of States members, that the best form to ensure a fast integration is to begin to work with time to resolve these questions, that, nevertheless, will earn big importance *cuando consumes adhesion.
Take advantage of occasion for *pedirle to *usted, to President of Parliament, to the Presidency in exercise of the Council, to the Commission, an urgent initiative to take a call to States Joined so that they suspend the execution of *Derek #Rocco *Bernabei, because the battle against death pity is a battle of *civismo that it has to rid always that it was precise and in #all the possible forms.
Today have debated with the Presidency in exercise of the Council and with President of the Commission the problems that pose, the proposals that has taken the European Commission in the frame of report to the summit of *Helsinki and also regarding attitude that presumably goes to follow the Council of ministers.
By reason precisely, not to give hit to strengths that struggle today by democracy, to send a message of solidarity to the *represaliados, pressure message by the authentic democratisation of diet, *les invite to not voting these two proposals, or, at least, to *devolverlas to the Commission, until *Turquía give concrete samples of democratisation and of respect to the international right.
To sight of transformations that is sylviculture in my country, in the sense of a reduction of the natural spaces, of a massive decrease of plant demand and also of a fault of public resources, *me see forced to signal this fact.
Some that payment system in great operations has worked very well, whereas -and #all agree- the problem of the excessive commissions in the current moment in changes is a negative environment, because had improvement expectations in the cost of the changes of coin during this period, expectation that has not seen fulfilled.
Also celebrate that the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer have toughened in report the requirements regarding that it have data easily accessible and comprehensible of form that the public opinion keep informed in any moment of the quality of the air and of the possible problems of pollution derived of the dangerous broadcasts.
The Liberal give compliance in the final vote to the common resolution, but affirm to time that has not modified the position in the question of reform of the Treaties, of the preparation and execution of the conference *intergubernamental , #such as it has put of self-evident in behaviour of vote on the Report *Dimitrakopoulos\/*Leinen.
Also there was reason *circunstancial, the self-evident inability by part of delegations to engage with a true process of negotiation of the agenda and, from sight point, it is necessary to ask #if it was lucky the coincidence of the inauguration of the conference with the of the beginning of the electoral campaign in States Joined.
The common fundamental goal to the two programs consists in contributing to the progressive construction of #one *Europa of knowledge, able to transmit to youngsters and to adults qualifications and the necessary competitions to insert in the market of employment and, it that also is important and often forgets, in society.
The relative measures to the conservation of fish populations and to control of activities of fishing have to be the content of the agreements signed in the frame of the regional organisations of fishing, and these organisations have to fulfil platform functions of the international cooperation.
And now, in moment in that it has given this step -and it is necessary to remember that relation with *Turquía did not comes of yesterday, comes of 1963-, *nosotros expect that *Turquía also know to answer of positive way, so much in his process of internal democratisation as also in relations, no only with the Community, but fundamentally with the country that has given the most important step that believe that it is necessary to hail: #Grecia and Government.
Is likewise evident, without embargo, that enlargement in terms foreseen did not allows neither the immediate realisation of a common external politics neither the definition of a project of economic politics, although this last was extremely urgent, also to sight of the rise of the dollar with regard to the euro and of the disappointing results of *Seattle.
In said document that traces back to the month of October of this year aims, among things, that so as to guarantee the global and sustainable competitiveness of industries of the European Union based in sylviculture or related with #the same, will be precise to guarantee surroundings that boost competition and boost adaptation of industry of the European Union to competition more *aguerrida.
am not economist, am civil engineer; but want to underline the exceptional work that Mr. *Bourlanges and his *coponentes have made, and expect that *nos help in a debate to evaluate notable subjects, to end to be able to judge, with the results in hand, in how measured materialises the Commission the political decisions expressed in the budgets and did not has, at the end, other pertinent consequences of application.
Seen that now we have been debating very thoroughly the Budget 2000 and Parliament wanted to mark criteria so as to that in the zones affected by war, as for example in the *Balcanes, make planning *plurianual of finance, #would have to adopt with greater frequency optics, instead of *dispersarnos excessively in small programs and isolated projects, that do not allow an effective control and that represent costs of upper personnel to the really necessary for the goals that wish to achieve.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0081\/1999) of Mr. *Valdivielso of *Cué, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on regulation proposal (*CE, *Euratom) of the relative Council to the granting of assistance to the New Independent States and to *Mongolia in reform effort and economic recovery (*COM(1998) 753 - *C4-0038\/1999 - 1998\/0368(*CNS)).
The past week knew that the Commission, that had to pronounce on help package of the #british Government, thought to answer to this need that plant purchase a world-wide scope, has *postergado decision once again, and delay affects to confidence of consumers and to the future of factory.
*Limitándome to the last events in the Council, the Presidency #finnish has prepared form directed to #all the countries members and to #all the #european institutions on the subject "women in decision processes" #whose answers have made possible to the Presidency #finnish the editorial of a report that contains nine indicators and #some recommendations.
Recommendation (To5-0079\/1999) of Mr. *Bodrato, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the relative Council to the celebration of the Agreement on establishment of regulations technical world-wide applicable to tyre vehicles and to squads and pieces that #can mount or use in said vehicles ("parallel Agreement ") (10167\/1999 - *COM(1999)27 - *C5-0073\/1999 - 1999\/0011(*AVC))
Now *nos gets news that connection of the computer system of the European Parliament in *Bruselas with Internet will not be available among 22 December and on 4 January: #this involves for the #european deputies the prohibition, the absolute impossibility to work among 22 December and on 4 January in dispatches in *Bruselas.
#Can indicate the Council #if it has posed this subject during contacts among the EU and the countries that have expressed wish of *ingresar in the Union? How measured thinks to propose with the end that it limit the uncontrolled flow of economic refugees to the EU, that has clear secondary effects of economic and social type (for example, increase of criminality) in States members?
On the other hand, #if the Community endorses with his true budgets types of credits of the European Bank of Investments, for example, project credits that make in third countries, the Council has stipulated that in these cases the *BEI has to deliver an annual report, so much to the European Parliament as to the Council, on measures that have carried out with credits endorsed by the budgets.
According to article 255 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community, the Council and Parliament, in term of two years after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, have to ratify in procedure of *codecisión the general principles on access to the documents and the pertinent limitations in plough of the private interest or public.
Then, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing will be able to take into account, with *algo of fine will by part amendments and adopt the legal text to sight of #the same, Propose that we vote on the Report *Papayannakis and that *usted choose the sharpest feather that have in arsenal and write to the Council in name of Parliament, with hope that the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fishing no pass without more by #alto it that agreed yesterday, but that take into account amendments.
is not *usted of agreement *conmigo in that the absence of price *transfronterizo *vinculante, or well suppression, comports, especially for the small companies -and with *ello go back to the subject of employment-, the risk that the national systems remain without effect owing to the big volume of imports; the risk of disappearance of the small bookshops, especially in the half rural and in the small cities, and that with *ello reduce accessibility?
And *nos find precisely in this debate. Thus *le invite to define with clarity the notable market in this context like a linguistic and cultural space; to that it clear the existence of import clause beside the possibility to dictate rule to national level, and to that it resort to the #french Right in decision and in considerations.
From sight point of the Commission, only will be able to surpass the regional tensions and claims of greater autonomy or of independence #if in Indonesian establishes diet, a system that guarantee sure enough a clear political responsibility and transparency in the direction of State and that fulfil the wishes of the big majority of citizens and citizen, of clear democratic ascription.
The European Union wait that #this mean a correct deal #as well as a public process, respect of norms of right State in front of an independent Court, access to defence of election and the permission of international observers to the process.
In the conclusions to the that got the European Council in the meeting of *Viena in December of 1998, stands out among things that the euro goes to strengthen the capacity of *Europa to promote employment, growth and stability and that the introduction of coin only will intensify the need of economic coordination.
Although the immense majority of the political strengths in *Eslovenia follows manifesting in favour of the goal of adhesion to the European Union, #this no always seems to translate in a common impulse. citizens do not seem involved fully in attainment of said goal, as it shows it the fact that information campaign gives -and #this *me seems significant- the impression that finishes to begin and is *algo toneless.
The spheres to the that more takes reference are the social security and pension problems that often arise *cuando worker emigrates, the free circulation of persons, recognition of qualifications, taxes included VAT, the environmental questions and the questions of the welfare of animals.
will Finish saying that, being as I am the only deputy of the European Parliament that has formed part *cabal and actively of Request Commission of the European Parliament since it founded in January of 1987, 12 years ago and half, expect that members of the European Parliament chosen for the new Parliament achieve that it follow respecting the right of residents and #european citizens to present requests to the European Parliament.
Therefore, in the next term of office, perhaps it was necessary to find a more agile method among Request Commission, the European Commission and States members, and demand to States members that give immediate answer to the requirements of Parliament and of the European Commission and that no *mareen partridge -as we say in *España- with terms excessively long, because *eso #can have perverse effects.
Regarding the prudential norms, with regard to the *cuales the speaker proposes that the present Commission a report on efficiency of norms at present in vigour, believe that the recent crises and form in that the European Union has faced up in general to these crisis, show the substantial goodness of these prudential norms.
This tragedy illustrates, besides, by #if it was necessary, the absolute need to control the influx of circulation by road -especially of the heavy vehicles-, to promote the rail traffic and to establish operation norms that guarantee the maximum security in breast of a #european market of transports sufficiently diversified.
The report of Mr. *Herman on the improvement of the operation of the institutions without modifying the Treaties constitutes the complement of another report approved the past year, allocated to the practical actions with regard to reducing the democratic deficit in the management of the economic and monetary union.
Regarding the inclusion of #Venecia in the goal 2, fits to signal that in the proposal of the relative Commission to the application during the period 2000-2006 of the new goal 2 of the structural Bottoms establishes responsibility shared among the Commission and States members regarding the definition of the apt regions to perceive helps.
Undoubtedly, that the *imputación was founded do not wants to say that Mr. *Moniz was guilty, but for *eso are the courts and, in this case, Mr. *Moniz, as #any one of *nosotros, has to understand that be representative of the #european citizens mean to be citizen more in #everything it that *respecta to responsibilities, and only in looks in that it is in game the interest of representation that has, has to have some true *salvaguardias against those who #can abuse, in detriment of the institution, in detriment of Parliament, in detriment of citizenship, of the procedural procedures.
The approval of the management governs by article 206 of the Treaty. The decision of the approval of the management conceived like character mechanism *primordialmente financial that bases in the report of the Court of Accounts, although it have purchased with the step of the years a political dimension.
*Le #would invite rather to consider the problem in the following terms: with the current integration of the markets, #if no had form of coordination of the fiscal politics, in this case States members yes that #would lose increasingly sovereignty in benefit of anonymous markets, and in this case #would have every time less possibilities to implant with efficiency a fiscal politics.
Have to find cancellation; but also am of the opinion that here it did not concede the approval of the management, as #if we see the result of the December vote, was clear that the previous points that motivated the agreement, that had been declared like positive report by the Commission of Budgetary Control, were refused by Plenary.
In the countries of #anglo-saxon right, in the *cuales no exists a Constitution, *me seems that the *rule *of *law is the cardinal principle that governs these better countries, more still, much better and that the has defended against this type of vision, according to the *cual in moment given the majority #can decide all it that wants: exist the laws and the texts, without embargo, no matters, #can say it contrary, is sufficient that want it the majority.
In general, will be necessary to establish with clarity the political priorities, adapt the structures of the Commission to his future tasks, expand decentralisation also in the field of the management of resources, *racionalizar works of the Commission and improve efficiency, and finally, to my seem, also it #would be necessary to adopt a code of behaviour for Commissioners and personnel.
capacity to show that it has exerted paper #worthy of President of the Commission to hour to decide #who have to form part of the commission and #which have to be wallets are things, #all *ellas, that will give to presidency and to his Commission his initial strong points and, in fact, will be able to *darle also his initial lean points.
Definitely defends it *usted and definitely will encourage *usted in *darle impulse with the new Commission, to the equal that definitely will carry *usted to cape the political union and likewise will give to the European Union means and the capacity to exert an important function in *Europa and in the world through his external politics and of common security.
And afterwards, #everything will go back to begin to final of year, since *cuando expire the mandate of the current Commission *dimisionaria, will have to request, once again, confidence of the European Council and of the European Parliament by a mandate of five years, mandate that #can see interrupted in any moment by the vote of censorship motion that -like #all know-has left to be a theoretical hypothesis.
*Yo believe that, knowing it occurred with the previous Commission, *usted will undertake the necessary institutional reforms and will tackle equally looks relative to the personal responsibility, to the internal control and also to the financial control, to the improvement of efficiency and to control right of the European Parliament regarding the Commission associated to #everything *ello.
In the next weeks and the next months also will have to define, of course, roads to organise interaction among the Commission and the European Parliament, in organ quality of control, included report presentation and the obligation to inform to the commissions of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, personally regret deeply that the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer have proceeded of form so precipitated to the vote of commitment amendments to the report of Mr. *Lannoye on directive proposal relative to honey, that the final the has weakened.
Gentleman President, am safe that we will get to a prompt solution and here -and #this are my last words-, when taking the word by last time in this term of office in name of the Popular Party European for reply to Mr. *Rothley, *me comes to the memory a lovely speech of parliamentarism *constituyente #spanish of the Constitution of 1812 in #where member of parliament said to #another -and *yo create, gentleman *Rothley, that *usted deserves it- that it was #be and firm in defence of the arguments and loyal with opponent.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0190\/99) of Mrs. *Oomen-*Ruijten in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer on directive proposal of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to commercialisation to distance of financial services allocated to consumers and by the that modify the Directives 90\/619\/*CEE, 97\/7\/*CE and 98\/27\/*CE (*COM(98)0468 - *C4-0647\/98-98\/0245(*COD))
the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the preparation of the European Council of days 3 and 4 June in Colony; -the oral questions *B4-0334\/99 and *B4-0335\/99 of Mr. Of #Giovanni, in name of the Commission of Institutional Subjects, to the Council and to the Commission respectively, on the institutional reform.
The Union has to have some modern norms of administration and transparency according to the #nordic model, with open meetings in the Council of Ministers, with a principle of advertising that give right to #all to know the public documents, with registers in #all the community institutions and with freedom of communication, #this is, right to inform to information means and to #others on errors or infringements in the administration.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, have got at the end of this debate on Diary 2000, and tomorrow the Assembly will approve surely these regulations. *Yo believe that, with these regulations, have reached an improvement of the economic and social cohesion, that is #one of the fundamental goals of the Union: an economic and social cohesion and a better territorial cohesion.
Subject: A just process for *Ocalan A common point in the positions of #all the institutional organs of the European Union on the subject *Ocalan is the requirement of the celebration of a just process *ypúblico, as this concept understands in the juridical systems of the modern societies and civilised.
#can not leave to manifest my *extrañeza in front of the fact that the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of Parliament have refused amendment presented by my Group to correct this situation, and that amendment have been declared inadmissible to be voted in Plenary, in application of article 60 of the Regulation.
Second, because it has not recognised the specificity of agriculture #portuguese neither have expanded the different types of quotas of production, in spite of that *Portugal is the country more *deficitario of the European Union, neither has considered the possibility to increase quotas of *regadío, that will be indispensable, since in *Portugal the *regadío is fundamental for modernisation of agriculture, the most retarded of the European Union.
In the conclusions remained reflected the priorities of the Assembly, and like condition *sine *qua *non to adopt a future agreement with this country, the clause of *condicionalidad or of human rights, the political dialogue and the parliamentary dialogue were priorities, #as well as the regional development, the social promotion, attention to women in situation of precariousness and a long #etcetera.
*Yo #would say that in #all the sector of the electronic trade, of the electronic activities of the intellectual property, the electronic signature, in general all it relative to services of information, including the subjects of intellectual property, *nos are in a field in the that the national States *nos have remained small.
Gives consumers the opportunity to request the commercial information that wish; gives to the *anunciantes the possibility to direct messages to #that that wish *recibirlos; gives to Internet providers, that provide access to network, the possibility to follow providing a service of post electronic fast, effective and sure.
Although it remains a lot for taking in the new community market, have shown that it is possible to protect the interests of employers, of dealers, especially of small and medium enterprises, and to time, defend to citizens in consumer condition, that are the goal and the end of work of companies so much public like private.
As until Monday was not possible to vote the corresponding amendments and as a result of *ello *usted *nos authorised to celebrate an exceptional meeting, since conversations *tripartitas had not taken place until the week before and went then *cuando knew the results of the Council, Budget Commission adopted the amendments that adjusted to the main decision immediately after the vote of #the same.
has not passed neither a year since Parliament ratified the provisional agreement splitting of the base that the clause of human rights that contained #would put to proof seriousness of the Government *mejicano to hour to guarantee that cooperation in matter of human rights was essential in relations with the EU.
Gentleman President, the European Parliament has supported unambiguously the cause of village *timorense and his inalienable right to the free determination and the independence and from always has contributed to a large extent to that fight have not dropped in silence, by it that *congratula that the term of office finish with position reaffirmation and discern materialisation.
Equally, the Commission judges positive the establishment by part of Nations Joined of a *transfund bear said query and, in this sense, *les have to inform that in this same week, probably tomorrow, approve definitively the financial participation of the European Union in this *transfund , surely with quantity of euro million that will go allocated precisely to study modalities of the insertion of the European Union in the process.
do not believe that any #another Parliament of the world loan *tanta attention to cast of the fundamental rights and the human rights like Parliament to hour to debate rape of the fundamental rights of citizens with reason of the creation of a space of justice #european.
The proposal of quota, together with the decision on compensations for crop of the industrial potatoes, do not influences, of way, in competition situation of industry *manufacturera. In fact reduces starch production of potato somehow, and in *eso do not have why put objections producers of starches.
Believe that effort now, in the next weeks, will have to be convince to the #european citizens of the importance of participation in the elections to Parliament and believe that, at least deputies that are here today, have taken all it possible so that work was not a trivial work, but that it was an important and definite work for the #european construction.
Without embargo, have known through source that, generally, is very informed, that already is preliminary draft species of report by this Assembly, among the Committee of Wise persons, services of the European Parliament and services of the European Commission, a species of preliminary report.
A last comment on intervention of the contrary side of the Assembly regarding the investiture of the new Commission: *nosotros *nos deny -and now talk in name of the socialist Group- to subordinate the procedure and the calendar of Parliament to the presentation of a report of group or a committee *extraparlamentarios.
But #if this pact pretends to be a pact allocated to intimidate of *algún mood to the Governments *socialdemócratas or to *crearles problems, Mr. *Poettering and his political Group have to know that #this no only #would create difficulties to the Governments *socialdemócratas neither neither only to Governments, as for example, the Austrian, in the that takes part also a conservative party, a Popular Party Christian, but that #would create difficulties to unification process #european.
Takes moments remembered with nice irony the electoral emblem with the that *me presented -the emblem of donkey- and *me invited to the *tozudez: an invitation that do not need because I am *tozudo by nature; without embargo, want to remember that the election of donkey took also reading passage of #Leonardo da Vinci that, when describing to donkey -do not know #if it is truth, because I do not have proofs- said that it is an odd animal, since it is able of dying of thirst before that to drink dirty water.
Wanted to know #if, by initiative of the Presidency #finnish, will be able to deploy at last, with support of Cross #Red and other international organisations, action determined to force to the criminal of war *Milosevic to not taking it that *tantas times takes: use blackmail, use to persons that today are in hands and of the that at all knows to force once again to the European Union to release pieces.
*Nos risk to remain trapped among two fires in conflicts, unless the #european contingents do not assist powerless to the last stage of an ethnic purification that do not has *conmovido too much to the fine universal consciousness: the elimination of the last #serbian inhabitants of this region, that have happened to be minoritary in country.
In the future years, the alimentary security of our *conciudadanos will depend fundamentally of way in that the new Commission know to defend, in the course of the next negotiations of the round of #Millenium, the full legitimacy of a model of zone #european distinct with an upper agricultural quality.
But also affirm that *me seems absurd that States members that in the past, by general norm, do not have *atenido never to #european norms of security, want to forbid like general norm the animal flour; or that now the Commission take a general question of utilisation of food rests in work document on purpose of oil utilisation and fats.
The second inform of the Committee of Independent Experts *nos helps in the guidelines, #many of the *cuales already appeared in the indications of Parliament and *usted same has anticipated with clear commitments like the of the new criteria for training of cabinets and of a greater transparency in relations with the European Parliament and with the public opinion.
Finally, rage of Mrs. Of Palace in press tyre back to audition no *augura swims good for somebody among #whose competitions include relations with the European Parliament and, although I recognise that Mrs. Of Palace *disculpó later by observations, awake without new embargo doubts about capacity to exert this concrete charge in breast of the new Commission.
Admit that commissioners subjected to trial of Parliament, to judge by audiences and by the statement today of Mr. *Prodi, have, individual and collectively, of the capacity and the necessary resolution to serve faithful and *inquebrantablemente to the goals of the European Union, in detriment of the interests of the group of workers and of villages of *Europa.
#can not ignore the challenges of globalisation to the that at present it confronts the Union, the peak of the audiovisual sector and of society of information, the need of an educational capacity of big *calado and amplitude and, finally, the need to establish the legitimacy of our institutions and give new vigour to forms.
Of face to this preparatory meeting that will take place in *Turku tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and had account of the increasing presence in *Europa, by misfortune, of delinquency organised, of criminality related with the world of drugs, of the traffic of human beings and of other similar offences, *me seemed incomprehensible that this House *enzarzara in discussion about #if it suits or not opening a debate on this question here in the European Parliament.
Likewise, the participation of States members in the administration council will allow to guarantee that time that the Commission have decided the annual program, #all the decisions relative to projects take on terrain, without going back to resort to the management committee formed by States members in *Bruselas.
The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of a just access to the media, the absence of guarantees to be able to carry out an electoral campaign, have conducted to the opposition, majority, to boycott the legislative elections of the spring.
The total liberalisation *indiscriminada, #such as it has carried out in *Alemania, already is a difficult situation bear to projects of *aprovechamiento of biomass and also for the projects of solar energy. In the social field, is evident that early will give place to cases, of lower dimensions, like the of "*Michelin" , because of the suppression "*racionalizadora" of employments to take go up the *cotización in bag of the energetic companies.
Have to say, gentleman President, that the *primer program *ALTENER and more advance the white Book on the renewable energies, that has developed the community strategy and the action plan for the year 2010, have been possible graces, insist once again, to collaboration among our two institutions, Parliament and Commission, and that the new politics of the European Union in matter of renewable energies has built precisely thanks to the good understanding among *nosotros.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0015\/99) of Mrs. *Ahern, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that approves program *plurianual of promotion of the energetic efficiency (*SAVE) (1998-2002) (7123\/1\/99 - *C5-0033\/99 - 97\/0371(*COD)).
is not precise to resort to the figures of commercial exchanges, investment and cooperation to development to deduce weight of the European Union in the region, but the tested economic solidarity of the European Union has to be so valued like capacity to contribute effectively to a peaceful solution of conflict.
Why do not take to see to *Turquía that recognition like country candidate to adhesion constitutes the exception of what have demanded to the countries (as for example, to *Eslovaquia) and that this exception takes by special reasons (that we #would have to refer with clarity...), for *facilitarle progress to the regulations demanded; and that course the will be the European Parliament and that, at the end, #this will judge his real appeal to adhesion to the European Union?
On the other hand, society is legitimately concerned by the challenges that the phenomenon of globalisation *nos poses: respect of the human rights and of the fundamental social freedoms, the protection of the environment and the preservation of nature, #as well as the protection of health of consumers.
With the solemn Statement of June month of 1998 the 174 countries members of the World-wide Organisation of Work engaged to promote the four fundamental rights of work: association right, respect of the labour minimum age, the prohibition of works *forzosos and the no discrimination.
In the frame of the current agreement of the common position, the requirement of the amendment *nº 5, to know, create a directive of the EU with some goals *jurídicamente *vinculantes for the renewable energies, is the minimum previous condition so that the document #can be taken seriously at least of an approximate mood.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0028\/1999) of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market concerning the common position approved by the Council (*COM(93) 646 - *C5-0030\/1999 - 1994\/0011(*COD)) with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to transport facilities of persons by wire (Speaker: Mr. *Miller).
Having present that the own Defender Village of the Government of *Colombia informs of a massacre by day of this year and that Jurist Commission Colombian attributes the 78% of #the same to the *paramilitares, with knowledge of the #colombian official strengths, #can *usted occupy , like President of Parliament, that during his private conversations talk of the subject of the human rights?
The first is to give graces once again to Mr. *Duisenberg for ensuring to this Assembly that cooperation process among #ECB and the national central banks is now sufficient, even in the case of a grave crisis in the that a financial institution of the zone of the euro #can need support.
From sight point is provocation for the feel democratic of villages that the European Parliament consider advance the fact that they give, with regularity, conferences of press after the meetings of Government Council of #ECB or the fact that, apart from the annual report publish monthly reports of the Central Bank European.
#This has to be the signal so that the great political strategies, budgetary and monetary do not pose always according to the approach of the one who sees novelty of coin only, but of the one who has to take into account the long term to give stability to the euro and to States members, and especially to reactivate the economy of the Union and chapter of employment that so much *nos concerns to #all in Parliament.
Like this, is necessary that have form of intervention of #ECB and an effective democratic control of operation and that in the #european politics concede priority to the resolution of the economic and social problems of the European Union and of States members, in particular growth politics and creation of employment.
In the first place, is necessary to encourage and boost to the #european citizens, associations and the small #european companies of the sector, to benefit of program it more possible averting concentrate the already scarce finances only in #few great events, in benefit of some those that privileged networks that, in the long run, as *nos teaches the previous experience, finish for having the monopoly of said finances; second, #would be timely to take all it possible to increase the planned financial endowment for program.
Consider that Parliament, in moment in that it approves measure of this type, offers a big opening to youngsters #turkish that complaining of errors of parents, #can watch to *Europa like a reality of big freedom, like a union of States in the *cuales culture, diffusion and solidarity among youngsters are important and fundamental elements.
By reason and to end to guarantee a high grade of security in transport so much national like international and eradicate distortions of competition, the European Union adopted the Directive 96\/49 on approximation of legislations of States members relative to the transport of dangerous commodities by railway.
And that constitutes a reason of particular pride, since prize carries the name of scientist, *Andrei *Sajarov, that subjected prestige to hard proofs of type to struggle by freedom of villages of the countries of the East against #one of the most #hideous forms of totalitarianism that has known this century.
But #can comprise part of anger that feel graziers and consumers of Big *Bretaña *cuando *enteran that they have found silts *cloacales in the *piensos that employ in *Francia, *cuando *enteran that the #british Government knew #this from June month but decided not touching the subject in the European Commission, and *cuando *enteran that in Realm Joined still sacrifice 60.000 heads of livestock because have more of 30 months of age and #can not go in in chain alimentary, although they are animal perfectly healthy.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, #would suit *usted *conmigo in that it results very surprising that #some States members ask now new explanations and additional explanations *cuando #this already debated during a year and half with these same States members in the Permanent Veterinary Committee? And #would suit *usted *conmigo in that States members that keep the prohibition of imports #would have to present new scientific data or of it contrary only give the impression of that they want to follow postponing until a distant future the realisation of the only market?
Lady Speaker, want to signal that dialogue *macroeconómico forms part of the complex process of the pact of employment and that, as it has exposed well the Presidency in exercise of the Council, is consequence of Colony decisions, trying, by means of the establishment of dialogue among social and responsible speakers of the economic politics and budgetary politics with participation also of the Central Bank European, achieve the goals that, at the end, pretend.
#Can begin to abandon concepts like #that? #Can begin maybe to adopt a more realistic opinion in fixation of interest types, with it that #would recognise change of conditions, by it that now #can begin to contain the increases of interest types, to measure that diminishes unemployment, not to suffocate a fragile growth?
Definitely, in his common position the Council has adopted #some important points as, for example, the compulsory implantation of values limit in two stages, a greater requirement on durability of control squads of broadcasts in the commercial vehicles weighed and buses, diagnosis system *on.*board, field control.
Although my Group #would have put *gustosamente other accents *algo different in #some points of program *DAPHNE, for example connection with programs community as *PHARE, *TACIS and *MEDA, because in #this there #be big quantity of resources to set up in the countries preventive measured candidates and campaigns, agree with Mrs. *Avilés regarding reaching a fast consensus and avert a conciliation procedure, and recommend only six amendments to the common position.
The Commission will ensure specifically that program was road notable to pipe synergies of the public authorities and of the *ONG to conserve the physical and psychic integrity and the social welfare of boys, teenagers and women in #all the fields of activity.
*Ellas express better of it that #would take it *yo way in that boys are excluded of politics of the European Union and in that the laws and politics that takes the European Union have a very real impact in lives of boys, an impact that is not #the same that have in lives of adults.
At present, this subject is in the centre of a political debate very lit in my country and *me seems totally inopportune, by not saying, inadmissible that Speaker, given his institutional position, support so ardently to #one of parts involved and besides ignore that article of the #italian Constitution refers on purpose to freedom to open centres of education deprived without costs for State.
#If I use a very critical tone, do not take it fundamentally against *usted, lady *Schreyer, as *usted has not been the responsible person during the last weeks, but #if like Parliament at the end of a year, in autumn, elaborate a budget, then split of the fact that in this budget determine some priorities and that these priorities are also the that in the course of budgetary procedure apply really, *surten effects and expect that it that consider important apply also really in form of politics.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate on the report (To5-0039\/1999) of Mr. *Chichester, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1998) 571 - *C4-0040\/1999) and to the European Parliament "Promotion of the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the energetic politics of the Community" .
Gentleman President, this proposal that will resolve -like this expect it- by means of a community regulation difficulties that find citizens and families to consequence of recognition fault of the judicial decisions on the end of the matrimonial bond and the exercise of the homeland authority deserves applause and charm.
Regarding the amendment *nº 11 -and expect to that formulate a new oral proposal to be able to *pronunciarme on the new version-, *cuando forces to take into account the interests of boys, *nos seems that it opens the door for trial -regarding bottom by part of State that has to receive the judicial decision- that do not has fit in the frame of this type of instrument.
The Commission is commissioned also of the execution of program *STOP, #whose goal is the to give the necessary training and information to professionals, in particular to judges, to #police services and to services of social assistance, in the fight against the traffic of human beings and the sexual exploitation of women.
Regarding the group of high level, #if the Commission and the Council approve it -as I already have said, the Commission will take it predictably the next day 24 of month, the Council on 6 December-, pretence #would be that this group of high level began to work to first of the month of February or even to finals of the month of January.
An international rule in matter of competition has to establish some minimum norms that prevent behaviours contrary to competition, like the creation of cartels for control of prices or zone cast, the abuse of dominant position or vertical restrictions and horizontals of competition, #all the *cuales distort competition.
attacks against columns of refugees and zones inhabited, the closing of borders and fetters to performance of the international organisations of help that loan humanitarian help, no only contravene in #all the cases Gin Convention on protection of the civil population in the zones in war and other international commitments, but that they are performances simply inhuman and of the all unacceptable.
norms that regulate the international economic relations and trade have to respect the fundamental social rights, have to serve to the interests of workers, contribute to development of the less developed countries, respect the environment and create the necessary conditions for development of #all villages.
Have considered, in base to Colony Statement, that works *preparativos have to concentrate , in practice, in three particular points: the size and the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the votes in the Council and the extension of the qualified majority; in addition to these three points, also will treat institutional questions related closely with #the same.
The amendment 18 of my Group, that requests that Parliament was consulted on the annual economic orientations, the decisions that concern to the budgetary deficits and #all another important decision that have to take in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union, leaving, of course, to side the independence of the Central Bank European.
To time, also wanted to *replicarle to Mrs. *Kaufmann, that finishes to quote to newspaper of class enemy, "*Die *Welt" , that the party to the that *ella belonged has been the only #german party that has summoned to a war of aggression after the *Segunda World-wide War, specifically against *Checoslovaquia, and to sight of *ello, #would have to abstain to take comments like the that finishes to pronounce.
Subject: political Prisoners in *Myanmar #Can Speaker in exercise of the Council inform on #all the celebrated debates and the decisions adopted recently by the Council of Ministers of External Subjects in relation with politics followed by the EU regarding *Myanmar and, in particular, on the possibility to achieve of the Government of this country amnesty for the political prisoners?
#If we do not approve today the report *nos will find in an unsustainable situation, as only deputies of the European Parliament #would be above the law to #that *respecto: a text that applies in the Council by the same to politicians and civil servants, in the Commission by the same to politicians and civil servants, #would apply in Parliament only to civil servants and no to deputies of the European Parliament.
The best demonstration, anyway, of #which is security that promotes is the own Treaty of *Amsterdam, the incorporation of it already achieved in *Schengen, the creation of a community police, the police #index card of citizens by his political convictions, his ideological orientation, action #sindical, even by his loving relations.
*Me seems that Mrs. *Giannakou has taken a big effort for adopting consensus posture concerning the action Plan, directed to integrate the different perspectives that there #be no only among the different *filiaciones political, but also among the different national traditions, to integrate also the different looks of the question and the diverse and in contradictory part interests.
Therefore, *me #would enjoy that my explanations went satisfactory, that Parliament #can reconsider requests, that gave the maximum urgency to acceptance of this decision with the guarantee that, #if in the future had problems from the point of financial sight, the Commission will pose the need to go more far regarding reservation Bottom.
For no *alargarme more, want to manifest that Group supports the 19 amendments and supports the legislative text, but demands that we do not attend to #one *segunda reading, but that approve this Regulation in the planned terms, demands that the Commission was sensitive to it exposed by the speaker, to it exposed by the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market and that, by favour, the Regulation approve inside the planned terms because, in case contrary, the situation for Canarians #would be worrisome.
To time that receive with satisfaction the contribution of Parliament, also want to recognise the contribution of the European Commission along the years, and in particular the of the ancient Presidents, President *Delors, colleague and ancient President #Jacques *Santer and now President *Prodi, the one who in statement of yesterday engaged to keep bottoms allocated to the distinct programs of *Irlanda of the North.
Among #all the human rights, freedom of expression occupies a special place, since without a free and independent information #can not fulfil the other human rights and fundamental rights, neither neither #can report effectively the grave rapes of the human rights, as, for example, crimes against humanity.
Why have not included other relative problems to the human rights that know that they exist in the Union, #such as the bad deals in prisons and in stations of police, the murders committed by political Groups armed and the situation of consciousness objectors, by so only appoint the most evident subjects?
Only wanted to *describirles a small consequence of this approximation. To mood to see, is a big progress that #greek journalists and Turkish are in actuality to avert that in the media stood out of countries continue defamation to the that have assisted in the last years and give erroneous information to the population on it that *sucede in the neighbouring country.
Concerning the proposals presented in the report, also consider that it is necessary reform, since the current situation has perverse effects -as it already has shown experience-, but is precise to take into account that reform #can leave to consider the results of the current campaign and potentialities of the #portuguese production in normal climatic conditions.
In this sense, the recommendations on communication politics and information that contains the Report Towers Mark play an essential paper, but do not owe *conformarnos with that the euro perfect the only market neither with that the euro allow, for example, price comparison easier or decrease of the cost of transactions.
#This reflects #one of lacks of the proposal of the Commission, that #would have to have completed the frame of the *OCM with maintenance mechanism of income of workers of fishing that allowed to limit the incidence of price falls and, with *ello, take unnecessary resource to the withdrawal and destruction of products of fishing.
#One of means to obtain said support #would be the to keep offer for the less advanced countries and *reflexionar together on coherence among action of the *OMC and the of the other international institutions so that the commercial liberalisation reflect in a sustainable development for #all the countries in roads of development, beginning by the poorest populations.
*Me #would enjoy that the countries that bear charge of effort of the economic internal cohesion and social did not employ this type of arguments, since they are the countries that receive bottoms of the European Union the most interested in efficiency of solidarity effort of the countries that bear effort.
Without embargo, said frustration converts in even more deep, #if it fits, *cuando, to sight of the new scientific elements, as in the case of substances that determine the destruction of ozone, bureaucracy and emotiveness taking forward to politics and science, prevent that they admit new and effective amendments from the point of scientific sight.
#If conditions observed still do not allow to initiate negotiations with *Turquía, but so only *concederle candidate statute to adhesion, with which do not creates therefore a particular juridical instrument, the conclusion -#can *leerla in the text- is that it is precise to resort to the UN for the definition of disputes. Of compliance with the resolutions of the UN, #this #would have to resolve before the year 2004.
#If at all it justifies the past and present politics of *Milosevic regarding village #albanian of *Kosovo, neither regarding his own village, crumbs launched only for reconstruction of *Kosovo, crumbs in comparison with money spent in war, #can not dissemble the fact that once again the western intervention in the *Balcanes no only do not resolves the problems in this region of the world but that the aggravates.
Of compliance with section 3 of article 247 of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community and the corresponding disposals of the Treaties *CECA and *EURATOM, Parliament has issued his *dictamen previous on candidates before the Council proceed to the nomination by unanimity of members of the Court of Accounts by a period of six years, that #can repeat mandate.
Of then is also the agreement for the creation of indicators, and have assisted in April of 1999 to the publication of the first resulted of these common indicators, that take in consideration place of woman, in the economic field, in the political field and in the social field, in relation with development programs that approve.
From this Assembly urge to the Commission to give preference to a review of #all consultancy structures and of decision, to end to obtain a just distribution among sexes, and to request to States members that fulfil with the recommendation of the Council of 2 December 1966, on equality among men and women in decision processes.
From the platform of *Beijing, and of commitment of the 189 countries around this platform, there #be, by it that *atañe to the European Union, to our region, three fields of action: first, the of each #one of states members; second, the of the political strategy of the group of the European Union; and, third, the of politics of the European Union to the countries in development.
The question is not, as, #if they go to concede #some thousands of litres of oil to orphanages and asylums, but #if *le go to deliver the necessary games to *Yugoslavia, to government legally chosen -respect of time the international right!- and no *selectivamente, to confront damages and put end to the political genocide suffered by village #serbian.
The amendments that has proposed Parliament treat to cover this grave gap and have an ambitious goal, #this is, create a legislative system that, in spite of devoting special attention to avert create useless bureaucratic complications, allow to the great productive potentialities of the Union express it better possible in the inner market facilitating, therefore, action also in the world-wide.
In days in the that so much it talks of paper and of the future of the community Institutions, wanted to remember that the credibility of organ like Parliament or the Council is closely linked to capacity to resolve the problems that disturb the daily life of citizen or to take part positively to the *respecto.
Have to confess that, *cuando returned again to *Timor Oriental, remained *desolado in front of ruins of the systematic destruction and no *me imagined that it #would come to *Estrasburgo and #would have the rare opportunity to know and visit the corridors and living rooms of the centre of the democratic power of *Europa, #one *Europa that shared with *nosotros pain and suffering of genocide, but also prowess and strength to resist the destroyer action and murderer.
Likewise, encourages for finding a solution to the regional riots, already mentioned here, in *Aceh and *Iria *Jaya and to the ethnic tensions in the *Molucas by road of the peaceful dialogue and of the constitutional reforms; consider particularly important that exist a National Commission for the Human Rights that treat the relative questions to rights.
Gentleman President, like member of the Group of the Green\/European Free Alliance and like #basque deputy, have to say in the first place that already the European Union, by diplomatic road, directed to the Government of *Nicaragua the past 18 November so that it found a fast solution to this subject that *nos occupies today and finished with obstacles that *oponían to the *Contraloría General of the Republic of *Nicaragua and for *decirles also, very categorically that, #if it is not transparent, #can lose bottoms of the European Union.
Already has remembered in Plenary implication in the subjects related with paper of citizens in the procedure established in article 169, the editorial of a code of behaviour of civil servants, access to the documents of the Institutions and of organs controlled by *usted.
The fact that Parliament renounced to proposal to build a common customs in the conciliation procedure celebrated in the frame of the previous report no means that #this have left to be our final goal.
The report of Mrs. *Schmidbauer is #worthy of praise because it treats of development of a gradual approach concerning infrastructure frame for rates of the common transports inside the European Union, #as well as of a gradual harmonisation of the relative principles to rates of #all the main means of transport.
reason is that, as we have been able to check in scientist audience and experts celebrated in Transport Commission and tourism day 17 February 1999, the system of the social costs *marginales proposed by the socialist commissioner of transports #Neil *Kinnock do not serves to impute the costs of transport infrastructure.
article 135 establishes that attributions of the commissions appear *anejas to the Regulation, but do not excludes at all the absolute majority, and, treating of a text that defines at all less that competitions of the parliamentary commissions, #would be paradoxical that, as it finishes to occur, the composition of a competent commission in an essential field -as it is the of immunities- fix, simply, with #some votes of difference.
#»»collateral Damages», #this is language used by NATO to define the death of civilians: during centuries in the *Balcanes will have to bear the called *collateral *damages , since uranium bombs employed by NATO already have contaminated the #yugoslav territory preventing, in fact, the return of #Kosovar to country, unless they run the risk of illnesses, malformations and deaths by radiation.
*Señorías, wanted to underline, nevertheless, the need that the Commission elaborate help program in favour of the #italian and #french populations that will suffer considerable damages and damages owing to the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, so much by the excessive traffic of arteries receptors of traffic excess, as by traffic shortage and of tourism owed to the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc.
The Council in statement of the past 7 April, when pronouncing on #this, added that the #indonesian Government has given #some steps that have been clearly celebrated. *Eso also has to see, among things, with the elections, with new laws for the political parties, but also with determined economic measures that have announced to stabilise the economic situation.
The impressive number of operations of traffic that effect every year in the European Union and the importance of the sums that are in game #would suffice by himself\/hisself alone to show urgency in concluding computerisation of traffic diet community and to guarantee to time a maximum transparency in the group of politics *aduanera #european.
will give a big step day in that space situated among Parliament and season was at last conditioned, of way that facilitate the personal relations and result friendly: for *ello is necessary to unblock the necessary means, it that will require #one *concertación active among society of Space *Léopold, Parliament (by his moral paper) and the #belgian authorities affected.
Is necessary that the European Union tackle these negotiations with the real will to defend the principle of prevention, #as well as the social norms, environmental and on the welfare of animals, necessary for a healthy and durable trade that respect the group of our economies and of consumers.
Is necessary to expand and improve measures in matter of prevention, information and protection of the victims, #as well as cooperation and coordination with justice, the police, the responsible authorities and, especially, with the competent governmental organisations, in States members of the European Union, among States members of the European Union and also in collaboration with the third countries involved.
amendments supported in the valid Regulation, and now have agreed that are in contradiction with *él. According to the current Regulation, for credit transfer of reservation is competent Budget Commission and for the rest of transfers - am in general terms - the Commission of Budgetary Control.
The exchange of experiences that produced in the preparation of the conference among the Group of the Popular Party, the Union of Age Persons and experts has served to obtain #all a series of valuable knowledges on the matter.
In this context wanted to ask to the Commission #if the regulation of application collects look, since I consider very important that the current system of balance among potato starch and corn starch respect. To keep said balance is fundamental that keep the system of compensatory premiums to potato starch.
Wanted to express my gratitude very especially to speaker Mrs. *Theato, that alas #can not be among *nosotros, and also of course to the speaker of the particular opinion of this commission, Mrs. *Kjer *Hansen, #as well as to #all members of this commission, that have taken an excellent work, since these contributions have had direct relation with development of this procedure.
Supposes also an important innovation when allowing separate on the one hand, the closing of accounts -species of technical procedure simple, as, to verify #if they have carried well accounts- and by #another, discussion or the opinion of Parliament on the management of the Commission in budgetary matter.
In norms appears now a very important distinction among a technical postponement and a political postponement, that has to have some clear foundations, to the equal that appears also a clear separation among the technical closing of accounts and the political posture that #can adopt on the question of #if we approve or no accounts.
In concrete, the report of Employment Commission sues it following: increase of proportion of unemployed that receive an active measure of promotion, like professional training, or measures of creation of work, in front of the proposals that exist in the guidelines, autonomy of the Central Bank European and autonomy of the social speakers, #as well as greater efforts directed to consolidate the public finances.
The existence, in this moment, of the Economic and Monetary Union shows that no treats of formality, but of a dynamic treatment of economic and monetary subjects, that presupposes besides coordination no only of the monetary politics, but also of the economic and social politics of states of the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, wanted colleagues, is a bit surprising see as on the one hand our European Union poses a debate on the great orientations of the economic politics extremely prolix, with concrete obligations and with a pact of rigorous stability, and on the other hand employment politics to base only of wander orientations, while *nos happen #all time saying that the big problem of *Europa and of Europeans is employment.
*Me interests especially take this brief intervention first of all for *recalcar the important paper exerted by Mr. *Bösch, the *cual -even in moments in that it was very difficult to carry forward this speech- always has been very coherent to hour to sustain the need of an independent organ, to sight of the gravity of the cases and of difficulties for *afrontarlos.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, the report of the that *me has commissioned *informarles tonight in name of the Commission of Economic Subjects refers to the proposal of the Commission to modify the *sexta managerial relative to VAT of mood that States members have the possibility to apply, with experimental character, the type reduced of VAT on services of big intensity of hand of drama.
Group *le sues to develop fully paper in the election of commissioners to obtain a substantial renewal of school and a presence of men, and also of women, able to face up, by qualification, to the great political challenges of the Union and to the own reform of the Commission.
And although, in effect, *usted has gone back to announce that the Commission goes to develop liberalisation of the market of material sakes and services, instead have not heard at all on the public services, on the services of general economic interest, as they appear now with total clarity in article 7*D of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
The five points that pose the European Union, NATO and the General Secretary of the UN are not five points that *equivalgan to a total war against Serbian, but five points that take possible security and stability for #all in *Kosovo and that at the same time guarantee and allow development of security and stability in the region.
In the first place, to the classical international Right, according to the *cual war only #can initiate after having been declared, it that has not been the case; how the Government of States Joined of *América abstain in the future of *enseñarnos archive images of the speeches of *Roosevelt after bombardment of *Pearl *Harbour by part of the #japanese squadron.

In a similar situation, buyer has to return product in place of purchase so that *le return money, repair product, etc. #would Have been much better -and #would have contributed authentic advantages to consumers- #if #this had right to negotiate said compensation or repair, etc, with representative of company -in case that it exist- in country of residence.

Like speaker of this file, have to remember that the Commission, in his initial proposal, had prioritised especially orientation of reform based in a substantial descent of prices with the goal to increase parts of the market to export in the frame of the obligations imposed by the *OMC.
Regarding the political advances, #would have to underline, as more important and new, the following: consolidates series of agreements punctual pre-existing; offers a definite solution to dispute on the classification of compulsory costs and no compulsory, that drags from 1982; happen costs of the Common Agricultural Politics to costs no compulsory.
goal is to allow to persons progress to the new #millenium; take possible that are the own persons the that make said progress through training and education, increasing possibilities to achieve work place, of *ayudarles to progress with time to access to work place better and to a better level of life.
Appreciate to President in exercise answer, but *permítame ask #if it has foreseen a suitable protection for banana entrance pertinent of *Lomé and of the Canarian Islands, in spite of changes that have produced to adapt diet of banana of the European Union to norms of the *OMC.
Neither has presented to the Presidency of the Council complaint of *Suecia in the sense that it neglect language in guilds of the Council, by it that it wanted to *aconsejarle that perhaps #would not have to bet necessarily by news anonymous of news agency but by the official communication that receives here of the Presidency of the Council.

My group has expressed from the principle in favour of reform of the structural and regional promotion that concentrate the available financial resources in the regions with the greater demand of development and that at the same time award a greater level of responsibility to States members, especially there #where complete regions remain excluded of the structural helps of the EU.
relations among Fishing Commission and the committees quoted have two main looks. By part Fishing Commission receives information on activities of the committees and, by #another, members of the commission have the possibility to take part like observers in the meetings of the committees referred.
looks juridical today examined constitute the indispensable base to regulate and harmonise the electronic agreements, the use and the future developments, always that Internet was accessible to #all, accessible but no regulated, to defend to classes more exposed, especially boys; protect against the electronic illegality, the *intrusismo by wire, but boost all *aquello that it #can generate places of work and expand culture.
bottoms of the EU contributed likewise to transform *Manchester in a big cultural core and tourist, when helping to build exhibition centre *G *Mex, concert hall of *Bridgewater, Museum of Science and Industry of *Manchester and the Imperial Museum of War (North).

Of course, gentleman President, *Turquía has not suffered type of special pressure -and, of course, no am of the abominable bombardments that know countries- for *avenirse to norms of a State of current right. By reasons that the Council of Ministers, so sensitive or severe in other cases, has not achieved *explicarnos!
time established responsibilities, the European Union has the duty of *paliar the inability of the usual protagonists of stage *comorano, launching reconciliation initiative *inter-islands, a significant humanitarian help, in particular directed to *Anjouan, and an original plan of urgent economic help for State *comorano.
In the case of the #czech head office of *Temelin, attainment of levels of maximum security demanded to candidates to adhesion in matter of nuclear head offices do not seems at all reliable, especially to sight of the planned employment by the authorities of the Czech Republic of type reactors #soviet -the *VVER 100- presented like squads of last generation, although they give proofs of scarce reliability.
The Commission understands that reactors of *Temelin are of a type that, in principle, #can improve to reach levels of acceptable security and, as it indicates in Diary 2000 and in March communication of 1998, the general goal of the Commission, by it that refers to this type of reactors, is to guarantee that the improvements undertaken by the corresponding countries apply of fast and effective way and carry to satisfactory results.
Says: there #be an agreement of 1995 that has not been signed by #all States members and the Commission is to adopt an initiative #Can have promise of Commissioner regarding that the Commission goes to adopt a proposal, was a directive, was a regulation -leave it to the Commission-, so that it no longer take lacking expect to States members *titubeantes?
The goal precisely is not a militarisation of the European Union, but follow promoting development so that it was an effective peaceful power and with capacity of performance that was in conditions of *relegar definitively to the happened war like instrument of politics in *Europa, in favour of the empire of the Right and of renunciation to the use of strength, #such as it has taken in *Kosovo.
The first refers to point 53 of the conclusions of the Presidency in exercise of the Council and *me #would enjoy to ask to #that with regard to gentleman #german Minister of External Subjects how interpretation it is necessary to give to the mandate of the Conference *Intergubernamental and, in particular to -quote- the possible enlargement of the vote by qualified majority in the Council -end of appointment-, had account of the statement of *Bélgica, *Francia and #Italia attach to the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
The *primer reason: in the era of globalisation, the national State European only will be able to keep it that appreciate and want to conserve in *él #if #this *Europa unifies as, under the conditions of globalisation, peace, security, the welfare and democracy for citizens and citizens, only will be able to guarantee #if they join to #european level, is to say, #if we have of a subject European, a European Union that it was able to act.
Of compliance with the agenda, Speaker in exercise of the Council proceeds to take a statement on activity program of the Presidency #finnish, the economic and social reconstruction in *Kosovo and Pact project of Stability for the *sudeste of *Europa and conviction of Mr. *Öcalan to pity capital.
The concept of #nordic dimension of the EU, that is shyly going out to the light although among *candilejas, covers sectors related with the internal security, as they #can be the nuclear security, the environmental and collaboration with external neighbouring zones to the Union.Is necessary to materialise in programs of concrete activity the ideas presented around the #nordic dimension of the Union .
Regarding *Öcalan, it minimum that we #can take by person to the that #many describe of terrorist of way, clear, that described of terrorist to *Arafat, or to IRE, before being recognised leaders and leaders of villages, it minimum that we #can take, after the sinking in this subject of asylum politics of the European Union and the one who has said it has reason, is *salvarle life, to avert like this a new *lacra in service leaf.
The Council studied immediately this case and took the resolution on 9 July to carry the subject to the courts of the European Community, basing in paragraph 2 of section 3 of article 213 of the Letter *Magna and in pertinent articles of *Euratom and of the Community of Coal and Steel.
Commissioners will have to, in case that like this *les demand, leave that the Committee of Ethical Subjects examine work type to the that will incorporate during term of a year after having left the Commission, with the end that #this #can confirm compatibility of the new work with functions fulfilled in quality of Commissioner.
Lady Speaker, want *referirme to the comment that took yesterday Mrs. Speaker, Mrs. *Fontaine, on the prohibition of the use of mobile telephones inside this hemicycle because I believe that at all it #there is more important, inside Parliament, that talk and *comunicarnos, but in the debates, no with external means like the mobile telephones, with bells and distortion that #this causes.
reasons that *nos have carried to this situation, against the that president of my Group carries warning from June month, have to see with that it has not known to put the limit of the institutional responsibility to groups that thought that the content of the report #can condition the investiture of the new Commission and, therefore, have insisted in that it debated now.
The Group of the Party of the European Socialists has kept a line of coherent behaviour along #all the process, that *resume in affirmation of the need to surpass positively the institutional and political crisis that paralyses to the Union from December of the past year.
Lamentably, gentleman President, although Mrs. Of Palace answered to our questions on transport of satisfactory way, and that like Group no will doubt in backing morning to the Commission, have to take state reservation on the candidature of Mrs. Of Palace #waiting for the definite results of the *OLAF and of investigations of the #spanish authorities, and because of mood in that it answered to interrogation on this subject during audition.
Answering to Baron comment *Crespo, that yesterday in the morning signalled that minister *recalcitrante of *Baviera had not resigned, *permítanme that *le put to the common of the situation: the alluded resigned yesterday before the vote in Parliament; without embargo, a lot *me fear that surely it will have to pass century before the European Commission reach efficiency level of the #bavarian administration.
The *segunda splits refers to interpretation that has to include like note to the Regulation, without embargo, the first part says: "constitution statement of the technical group is not according to section 1 of article 29 of the Regulation" . *Usted *nos commissioned this subject and *nos awarded the possibility to formulate interpretation like note to the Regulation *valedera also for the future.
deputy, Mrs. *Roth-*Behrend has called attention on a *importantísimo subject. The Commission, when fixing the own priorities and propose the approval of #this has to have in mind the subjects that really matter to citizens like the questions of environment, a sustainable development completely #as well as protection requirements of consumers.
Fifteen executives that displace to *Bruselas, exert there his legislative work, go back act followed to his respective capitals and apply the laws dictated by the Council, or was, by *ellos same. work method takes that the executives exclude increasingly to the national Parliaments -*Europol and the preparation of the convention *Europol are a clear example of *ello- without *traspasar the legislative function to the European Parliament.
But the truth is that, later, so much Nations Joined like the international observers and the own #indonesian authorities, that considered that scrutiny passed of free and just form in spite of #all pressures and of intimidation campaign carried out by militias adherents of integration, the truth -said- is that, *cuando took public the results, again installed terror in *Timor Oriental.
Is very clear that the authorities have to take in account the possibility of seismic movements when examining the suitability of place chosen for the construction, and have the obligation to ensure , through the pertinent structural solutions, that a possible seism neither affect to security of head office.
In this sense consider important to take a more global assessment, to the light of politics in matter of interventions that, as I have read in the report on the budget of the Union of the next year, foresees a strong restructuring of attention politics to small and medium enterprises present inside the territory *transfronterizo.
From beginnings of year have produced #news *alentadoras on recovery of the industrial production, mainly like result of the replacement of imports, control relatively tighten of inflation and a solider situation of payment scales, produced mainly by the strong rise of price of oil exports.
From takes *algún time, the Commission has recognised that exists connection among capital flight and corruption and criminality in *Rusia, and comprise also the threat *acumulativa that represent these conditions for the transition of the country to a democratic system and a market economy that govern by right state.
Meanwhile, the Commission considers that, in particular in #day of said elections, has to continue opening politics *cautelar of relations with will Go through a wide dialogue, with seen to encourage to the Government of Mr. *Khatami and to defenders of reform, #many of the *cuales are a considerable prowess in efforts by change in some extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances.
will Continue efforts to achieve support and the durable stability, and of course, also will follow trying keep to Parliament fully informed, because we value enormously commitment with our common goals to guarantee stability and the maintenance of peace in region so ailed of problems.
Nevertheless, *me ask #if *Europa really #can carry out an autonomous politics in this field. Until how point will defend the Commission autonomy in the international scene and in how measured will struggle for saving the power of #european decision in matter of alimentary security and the political decisions in the field of the alimentary products?
Nevertheless, more that of a new action treats to see #if the considering *nº 25 do not reflects already this need to give priority to exports to improve the position of the #european industry, world-wide leader in some renewable energies, and to it that have taken reference #some of orators, because it is truth that here have some very clear advantages with regard to producers.
In conclusion, and to the light of said considerations, wanted to call attention on the need to make, in matters so complex in that the market and rules confront to the collective welfare, analysis of cost-benefit #whose temporary reference was the long term for the introduction of measures directed to reduce the energetic intensity of the final demand.
An agreement that establishes the total liberalisation of the 95% of the #south african exports to the EU along a period of ten years with the elimination of the corresponding tariffs to the 86% of his industrial products covers a too much long time for a country that confronts economic and social problems so grave.
With reason, want to ask #if the Commission will present the agenda of the meetings of the Commission and work documents more important before the meeting of the Commission so that like this it #can appear #any information on the documents in the press before the celebration of the meeting and exist greater interest by the meetings by part of the press.
The inclusion of *Turquía -by moment #can not say at all concretise in name of my political group since we are still a debate to the *respecto, although personally I believe that it has to have candidate status to adhesion to the European Union, #such as it has said Mr. *Verheugen- is urgently necessary no only for democratisation of *Turquía but also for peace and stability in the *Balcanes and in the *sudeste of *Europa.
peace among the two States, #Israel and Palestinian, will not be durable but with condition that economies develop in the frame of a favourable regional cooperation to a sustainable and just development for #all parts, cooperation that in *primer term has to take into account the most vulnerable territories: think, for example, in the problem of water.
Subject: common Politics In July past, minister #finnish of External Subjects took the word in *Estrasburgo, in quality of representative of the Presidency of the Council, to affirm that the goals of *Finlandia are that the Union have of a common will, a common politics and a common voice.
Nevertheless, exists a wide majority in Parliament in favour of the #european participation, no only with exchange of the best practical or cooperation procedures, with it that agree, but also with utilisation of #some of the previous programs that existed in the past; in particular, Poverty programs *I and Poverty *II and mood in that #this tackled the problems using approach that split from the base.
*Permítame *preguntarle, gentleman President in exercise, #if it #would be had to present an initiative in breast of the Council to ask to the Commission that believes a new program relative to poverty that take use of it better of the past, but that it was an authentic program, no only expert group that exchange ideas neither meeting celebration in exotic places of the Union.
Taking into account the circumstance that accidents nuclear do not detain in the national borders, #would be now forced *decirles to the countries candidates to adhesion to the European Union, #if they continue with his risky nuclear politics, looming in this way to #all the European Union -am in *Temelin, in *Krsko, in *Bohunice and in *Mochovce, that under these conditions #can not neither has to produce adhesion.
Lady Speaker, in note that *le gave said that had the intention to pose the question of the visits of Chinese President to *Francia and to Realm Joined, and repercussions for rapes of the human rights in Chinese, and the arrests effected by the police and performance authoritarian in *Francia and in Realm Joined.
In chamber place, after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the European Union has to answer also to #a lot of new requirements. #Can quote the fields of the inner politics, the space of freedom, security and justice, chapter devoted to employment or the greater possibilities in the field of the protection of health and of consumer.
Is necessary to set up a more conscious administration with the costs and has to delete the *despilfarro, of the that have been innumerable witnesses occasions and that the reports of the Court of Accounts have taken out to the light along these years, #if it wants that citizens community see in the community organs serious partners in development process of *Europa.
Clearly, follow being too much prompt to judge the results of the mandate of #ECB, but, also to this *respecto, #can indicate already signs positive, not being minor of *ellos the that investors are had to loan money to the governments of the zone of the euro with some types of interest very low.
has talked here a lot of independence; and is truth that, with the Treaty of *Maastricht, the that believed that price stability was an indispensable condition for development sustained and the that believed that to dominate inflation was necessary a Central Bank, have won. And the that believed that it #can take thing with the monetary politics or with the economic politics with #such to grow in the short term and artificially, have lost.
Although *me *percato and appreciate that the wish to see published the votes or records by part of Government Council do not appears in the resolution proposal that will be voted tomorrow by Parliament, in this debate has loaned attention, more of the that expected, to the phenomenon of transparency, that culminates with the publication of the votes.
This wide evaluation covers an extensive series of indicators that include, of course, the evolution of the real economy, variations of employment and unemployment, an analysis of the evolution of the type of change in so much have influence on price level in the zone of the Euro.
In this same road, also have to register pleased the recent conclusion of the Presidency of the European Council of *Tampere in front of capital bleaching, in the that signals the decision of the Council to "guarantee that they give the concrete steps to proceed to follow-up, preventive embargo, seizure and *decomiso of the benefits of offence" .
A realistic politics of immigration #would have to consist, to the contrary, in hampering the situation of immigrants in *Europa suppressing, in particular, help social -political that it is, by it other, the of the #american Congress-, diminishing the economic helps to the countries that boost immigration and organising of systematic form transfers until border.
Need a big debate also on the geographic enlargement of the European Union, on contents and demand to the Council of Ministers -ladies and knights that are there represented- that have value to direct to *Europa to a positive future, as it treats of stability, of peace and of democracy in the century *XXI in our continent.
Expect that the Commission and *usted, in the proposal that *nos go to present, have prowess to fly higher and know to motivate with *algo more exciting that the mere *refundición of the garbled texts of the Treaties, the need to define a constitutional part in the fundamental texts of the European Union.
Of course, still has not inscribed credit in game, but, instead -and is my second point- has inscribed an enormous credit (60 millions of euros) in reservation for the statute of deputies, *algo quite garbled since this statute still no exists, and that, anyway, although it approved a statute of deputies, is evident that #would not apply in the current term of office.
Gentleman President, at any rate, wanted to remember that when deciding not raising the embargo against the bovine meat #english, *Francia do not takes in this case but apply the Treaty, that leaves the possibility to State to forbid or to limit imports by reasons of protection of health and life of persons and animals.
The first is that we are in the European Parliament and have celebrated, the past Friday, a debate without the Commission and without the report of experts, debate during the *cual believe that the Assembly and, of course, my Group treated to situate the subject in the frame that *le corresponds, is to say, inside it that they are competitions and obligations like #european deputies, of face to #ours *conciudadanas and *conciudadanos.
As now we know that cars are responsible of the 12% of broadcasts; and that persons that buys cars is not at all conscious that vehicle also is an instrument *contaminante and of how much contaminates, whereas yes it knows, for example, how means the so much by one thousand of alcohol in blood; *yo yes know that #if I buy car that consumes three litres of fuel each 100 kilometres is car of low consumption, is urgent that *concienciemos to consumer of pollution *ocasionada by cars.
Is fundamental to boost the local initiatives of employment, support the social economy *garantizándole a juridical recognition, recognise really, even by means of public finance, to the *tercer sector, form of economy that is among the traditional public sector and the yielding sector, based in the creation of useful activities for life in society.
Gentleman President, treats of an interesting report and of proposals that probably obtain *bastantes votes of Parliament; but, further of it that *nos proposes the Commission, that consists simply, *me seems to me, in restarting the process of *Luxemburgo, poses doubt: why the Report *Monti do not occupies the centre of worries *cuando shows clearly that the absence of social convergence and fiscal convergence slope put of work in #all the countries of the Union?
It important is not the preparation of a catalogue of the rights, but achieve that #all have consciousness of it important that is the first infancy, to avert that in the following years configure society in the that youngsters, by not having enjoyed of rights during infancy, #can not express by any half that was not alteration of order.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, in name of the Commission, wanted to *congratularme in the first place by the approval of the *dictámenes on directive proposal relative to notification of the judicial acts and *extrajudiciales in civil and commercial matter, #as well as regulation proposal on competition, recognition and the execution of judicial decisions in matrimonial matter.
Therefore the question -and comprise and appreciate his fine will, gentleman Commissioner- is the following: Is had the Commission, in front of the *hostigamiento and pressures that are #european companies, to take *algo more that express consternation and worry, and to take *algún type of measures -and to *ello engaged predecessor, Mr. *Brittan, in front of Parliament: know it well because *yo *le formulated the question in day- in the case that #that *incumplimiento follow being absolutely evident and *palmario?
Subject: Initiatives of the Commission to contribute to the preparation of the countries candidates to adhesion adhesion to the EU, and therefore to the inner market, of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental will involve pressure in the field of competition that will take that it accelerate the process of structural changes in countries.
With regard to the question of the transitory regulations that they #can request the countries candidates in the frame of this chapter of negotiations for adhesion, the basic point of negotiations of the European Union consists in that measures only are possible in exceptional cases and for time term and field of application limited.
In my Group exists an important number of pertinent members of neutral countries and no neutral that *oponen *frontalmente to #all this idea to create defence identity #european, and the debate in breast of the neutral countries is conducted of a very deceptive way.
Here in Parliament today has remained perfectly clear and the majority has been very sincere to the *respecto: want defence identity #european, want armament industry #european that it was competitive and want a #european army; but nobody has consulted to the public opinion of States members.
The European Union has to have an only goal: take part in the *restablecimiento of peace, reach a statute for *Chechenia, of compliance with it foreseen in the agreement signed by *Rusia and *Chechenia on 31 August 1996, and has to likewise assume commitment to remember that #this *Europa #if it wants to defend the human rights, #can not continue endorsing the fact that *Rusia consider strength and the army the only instrument to take politics.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the continuation of the debate of the report (To5-0062\/1999) of Mr. *Schwaiger, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1999) 331 - *C5-0155\/1999 - 1999\/2149(*COS)) and to the European Parliament on the approach of the EU on the Round of #Millenium of the *OMC
In effect, given the challenges posed, is evident that the next Round #can not limit to expand the normative frame, by important that *ello was, neither #can neither watch only so that the commercial liberalisation contribute to the economic and social growth of the less developed countries, although it share fully this goal, but that it has to also establish norms that have to take effective the opening of the markets and guarantee fulfillment of #the same.
And now, gentleman Commissioner, wanted to *preguntarle in the first place #if it confirms intention of not accepting in the agenda of the next negotiations #any *reconsideración of the agreement on the textile sector in preparation and, second, how considers that it goes to affect to the textile industry #european Chinese entrance in the World-wide Organisation of Trade, taking into account that this country is the *primer world-wide exporter of textile products.
Said #this, negotiation round of the *OMC do not serves to create *algo *supranacional, as it fears often, that oust the international Rights or that prevent to take fluctuate the free market, but especially to give true rules to #all *nosotros, #as well as to watch by #some fundamental rights like the right to health, education or to the social functions in a frame of *salvaguardia of the rights of citizen.
liberalisation of the world-wide trade is a positive process that generates development and that it #can be hindered no only by the protectionist practices of States, but also by the creation of situations of distortion of competition like the abuses of dominant position, cartels, the *dumping - think, for example, in dockyards - so hurtful for *Europa.
In the field of the structural politics is evident, for example, that what greater was the number of States members, more #unlikely will be that they #can reach reasonable decisions according to the principle of unanimity, #if they pretend to apply the scarce bottoms, the scarce resources, so that they benefit really to the poor regions and to the poor groups of the European Union
Without embargo, the Council finishes to initiate, without expressing it clearly, an irreversible process that #can conduct it, #if nobody detains it, to award a mandate of complete negotiation to the Commission, and in this way, in application of the new article 133.5 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, *desposeer to #all the national Parliaments of power of definite ratification, but always, obviously, without expressing it with clarity.
The Council expects that the guarantees that has given the provisional administration, as it designates, on respect of the human rights and of the civil freedoms are respected without condition #any and that indictment charge against Prime minister *destituido, Mr. *Nawaz *Sharif, was pursued inside respect of the legality in front of a civil court and public.
To answer specifically to the question of Mr. *Duff, the Union, after the coup d'état, has cancelled the signature of the new agreement of cooperation among the Community and *Pakistán, and have suspended our political dialogue, to send, simply, to the new masters of *Pakistán, a message on worries with regard to the coup d'état and to consequences.
As it is clear that the problem of the *Cáucaso #can not be solved of form in that they want to solve it the Russians. Therefore same, *me seems very important that no *nos remain with arms crossed, that the Commission take #his this call and loom with categorical measures, as for example the freezing of the new agreements *TACIS, and that papers get to the offices of civil servants #russian, so that we are not *nosotros the only in having all #this by writing.
Likewise, takes lacking to concentrate attention -and our budgetary efforts- in programs of evaluation of practices that follow in the field of prevention, of therapy and of the *reinserción, #as well as in the field of the social and sanitary consequences, so that the corresponding results guide to the countries members and candidates to hour to trace his national politics.
Gentleman President, also *yo wanted to back the content of the #german initiative directed to improve information exchange on trip documents falsified and to reinforce security of borders of the European Union so much for States members like the *mio, Realm Joined, that do not forms part of *Schengen, as for the that they find in the perimeter of the European Union.
To finish, also expect that the Presidency #finnish remember to the Governments of States members in the Council of *Helsinki that for the creation of an only market is necessary that allow the acquisitions *transfronterizas and the restructuring of key companies without that produce any political interference by part of the Governments of States members.
In the forum of the human rights of this morning have talked with #one of colleagues #finnish of Speaker in pertinent exercise of the Ministry of External Subjects Finn on a concrete case on the that has treated recently the European Parliament, the case of #Alexander *Nikitin, man that will be processed to #few kilometres of distance of *Helsinki by high betrayal.
*Nosotros, in Parliament, adopt a resolution in the month of October that marks clearly line that #would have to follow the European Parliament, although, as it has exposed here -and has said it Mr. *Poettering in name of my Group-, there are #some discrepancies inside Group on the importance, character and the scope that it is necessary to give to this candidature of *Turquía.
Without embargo, #this #can not suppose the suppression of #any of the requirements regarding democratisation of the Constitution and of the political reality, a fundamental improvement regarding respect of the human rights, a political solution of the problem *kurdo and the end of occupation of the north of *Chipre.
Precisely by #this, *yo #can not approve #some of the amendments that obtained a majority backrest in the Environment Commission and, especially, neither the that have presented Mrs. *Breyer and Group, #some of the *cuales are *superfluas and do not contribute to improve the text of the legislative proposal and #others do not have at all that see with the present proposal of directive, since they do not save relation with field of application.
The public information has insisted in that directive proposal has a fundamental importance and offers the opportunity to back legal measures, included the right of society to appoint and disfigure to the governments that do not adopt the necessary measures to fulfil this directive.
The Commission will take in account #this and will draft again the text of the following way: " The Commission studies the possibility to present suitable proposals for harmonisation of measurement procedures of dioxide broadcasts of carbon of vehicles pertaining to category *M1, in compliance with the annex 3 of the directive 70\/156."
#There is diverse questions that *nos follow concerning, like cut in finance, that remain out of the field of application sectors of increasing importance like the of aquaculture, the *poca concretion of informations that will receive consumer -specifically Mrs. *Fraga expressed it in regard to the distribution of zones proposed by the Commission-, or the fault of other notable data like the minimum size.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the proposal of the Commission of a new *OCM for products of fishing and aquaculture do not attends adequately the needs and specificities of this sector in the diverse States members neither takes into account potentialities that still exist, it that results so much more incomprehensible what that the own Commission recognises that the European Union matters the 60% of product consumption *pesqueros.
The report of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence encourages in mentioning the question of the human rights. But, after having amended the proposal of the Commission, the report pronounces in favour to continue the deepening of the Union *aduanera with *Turquía.

In *Dinamarca have had from the century nineteen a stupendous tradition of permanent education and precisely writer, priest and #one of creators of the #danish constitution, *N.*F.*S. *Grundtvig appears like #one of the *pilares fundamental of #all the #danish movement of the popular upper schools. movement that contributed to education of the common persons in a period in the that #this was *algo out of it normal.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0075\/1999) of Mr. #Aparicio *Sánchez, in name of Transport Commission, Regional Politics and Tourism, on regulation proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that it establishes permission distribution for vehicles of heavy transport of commodities that circulate by Swiss. (*COM(1999) 35 - *C5-0054\/1999 - 1999\/0022).
Of course, regarding the statistical data on #whose base proposes permission granting for vehicles of heavy transport, data of the external trade that we have until today, essentially #can not be correct, since with the current limit of the 28 tonnes in Swiss, transports by road to big distance, as for example from my country, from #Grecia, are not economically profitable and therefore do not make.
Certainly, with forecast of transmission of the return of permissions that have not been attributed until 15 September, in place of 15 November that proposed the Commission, reduces the possibility to be unfair in the final attribution, that has to take according to the real needs, and helps to companies in programming.
Is essential that citizens comprise the true goal of this package, since no treats simply -although it is important- to warn competition *tributaria disloyal or to guarantee the correct operation of the inner market, concepts #this, repeat, very important, but that to the majority of persons #can seem bureaucratic or distant, but that treats, rather, to take *algo very concrete for the daily life in *Europa: treats to create places of work.
The achieve affirm the majority like rule in the Community, like base of the political operation of the Union (very important for Parliament in measure in that we #can *codecidir), the have the juridical personality, the that they include in the Conference decisions that has taken the Council, as, for example, draft a Letter of fundamental rights... bear how serve all #this #if it do not includes in the Treaties?
The European Union has bent also by means of the Presidency of *ustedes by an option *atinada when insisting in that the reform process of the Treaties has to have concluded and go in in operation in the year 2002, to more take, so that it facilitate a prompt adhesion, because it is important to watch by that the reform process do not convert in the enemy of the enlargement process.
The Commission *sufraga the greater part of administration costs of the Office of #Alto *Comisionado for the Human Rights of *Colombia and finishes to approve program *plurianual to support the human rights in the #andean region with finance that rises to 11,5 millions of euros, roughly, the greater part of the *cual will go allocated to *Colombia.
Gentleman President, #any one that are the games of budgetary hands to fund help to reconstruction of *Kosovo, the Council, like Parliament, denies to tackle the true problem, that is reconstruction of *Kosovo #as well as reconstruction, also necessary, of Serbian, #would have to fund with charge to the military budgets of the responsible States of bombardments.
#One of the most important decisions adopted during the last autumn has been commitment contracted in the summit of *Helsinki, by means of the *cual the Community and States members show will to ratify the Protocol of *Kioto before the Conference of River 10, that will take place in the year 2002, and also will undertake #all the necessary measures so that said ratification was possible.
Our question is the following: how measured propose to adopt the Commission and the Council to guarantee that Parliament converts in a real speaker in the preliminary work, #as well as in the contribution of the European Union to "*Beijing more five" and in the official delegation of the European Union in the conference of New *York?
#- - Report (To5-0088\/1999) of Mr. #Miranda, in name of Development Commission and Cooperation, on the communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council - Consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on the legislative procedures in course to 1 May 1999 in the field of development and of cooperation (*SEC(1999) 581 - *C4-0219\/1999) Confirmation of the first reading: *COM(1994) 289 - *C4-0090\/1994 - 1994\/0167(*COD) - ancient 1994\/0167(*SYN)
In the first place, wanted to congratulate to the speaker, Mr. #Aparicio *Sánchez, by work that has carried out in relation with this question, and protest by that it have not received the integral text of the agreement among the European Union and Swiss before that part of distribution of permissions, that is not more that part of the global agreement.
Believe that before June will be able to find the definite formula, that, as they know, do not bases in the decision of the Commission -not even of the Council, #would say-, since it is thing of Nation Organisation Joined and those who take part are states, but, in any case, repeat, give the political will and the political budgets, since in subjects sight points are identical, to advance together.
Obviously will have competition in the field of the evaluation of risk elements and to evaluate said elements of risk, scientists that work in the agency will not be able to depend only of his own opinions and criteria, but that they will have to consult also to scientists of States members. Because an agency of these characteristic -agency or authority or it that it was- no only will have to be independent, but besides will have to keep in contact with scientists of States members.
In the territory of the European Union there #be not a negative attitude in front of the legal immigration, but that the problem in himself\/hisself is the existence of the illegal immigration and even of the illegal traffic of persons of third countries, problem that yes fits to combat; but has not tried in no way hamper the legal immigration.
Gentleman President, rule on the procedures of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in virtue of article 321 of the Treaty of the *CE, of article 33 of the Treaty on *EURATOM and of article 29 of the Treaty on the *CECA, establishes that the deliberations of the Court of Justice of the European Communities will be secret and will remain secretly.
Gentleman President, am entirely satisfied with the answer of the Council, but before concluding this session wanted to *preguntarle to the Presidency of Parliament when will keep the debate on the big group of questions proposed in the report of Mr. *von *Wogau, in relation with politics in matter of competition and of subventions state; in a principle, this debate had to have taken place already this morning, but has gone delaying #some hours along day.
The amendments only pretend to avert that Bottom take *algo that in any case #can not take; the purpose of the Regulation proposed is to allow the continuation of the financial contribution of the EU to Bottom. do not pretends in any case modify the essence of the current Regulation (*CE) *nº 2614\/97, reason by the *cual approved urgency procedure in the first place.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0089\/1999) of the Round Mrs. *Jiménez, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, on decision proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Decision 96\/411\/*CE relative to the improvement of the community agricultural statistics (*COM(1999) 332  *C­0042\/1999  1999\/0137(*COD))
Of course, since the common agricultural politics is of a situation in the that pay subventions in export moment or in entrance moment in intervention to a situation in the that subsidise each individual animal by acre or crop hectare planted, is evident the enormous importance that has know exactly how many animal there #be in the Union, how many hectares, how many *olivos, etc. #All information is fundamental.
Subject: Statements of *Ecevit after the arrest of *Ocalan Prime minister #turkish, Mr. *B. *Ecevit (the one who in 1974 gave attack order against the Republic of *Chipre, Been member of Nations Joined and country candidate, in actuality, to entry in the EU), declared in front of journalists *tucos and foreigners, immediately after the arrest of the leader of the PKK, To. *Ocalan, that *Turquía will not accept indications of any #european country in relation with trial of *Ocalan.
#Can indicate the Council #which were reasons of the announcement of said informal extraordinary meeting, why was surrounded of reservation, #which were conclusions and decisions, how paper is called to exert *Europol, how other services of national judicial police, international or Europeans are engaged in the application of the decisions quoted and #if #this affect exclusively to the organisations *kurdas or also to organisations and movements that act in countries of the EU?
By it that refers to the internal structure of the Commission, multiplied the directives to end to give occupation to an every time greater number of Commissioners and, #if it continues impulse, as it goes to happen of twenty to thirty Commissioners, go to create again #others *tantas directions and multiplication, that do not corresponds to an internal coherence, to homogeneity of the tasks that exert, will give disastrous results.
In this sense, an important step that have to give to achieve tuning among the community institutions and citizens, #would be precisely the preparation of a code of behaviour that facilitate confidence relations among civil servants and the public and that this code was accessible and comprehensible for citizens.
Wanted to signal -now that are the questions related with Right Commission of Woman- that, obviously, in the amendments 1 and 2 relative to the Commission of Public Freedoms and of Inner Subjects and Employment Commission and Social Subjects has to remain clear that to said commissions no *les #can attribute competitions in matter of discriminations in reason of sex, since of *ello commissions the Commission of the Rights of Woman.
These two proposals are directed to open to operators the new market of broadcast of electronic money in a normative frame of neutrality from the point of competitive sight, taking into account, on the one hand, the interest that it develop a correct competition in the sector and, by #another, the existent realities in #some States members.
deputies to the European Parliament #can not take thing that demand to the Commission that interrupt cooperation in the frame of the Agreement of *Lomé and that beg to those who have designated to himself\/hisself same like leaders of the *Níger that respect the fundamental laws, that *restituyan power to a civil Government and that respect freedoms and the human rights.
But *yo #would want to signal that, not to persist in a bad tradition, at least it #would be necessary to leave that it debated the subject Regulation Commission, since in my opinion #would be abusive or, anyway, interpretation *tendenciosa, allow that a simple majority #can modify competition of the commissions or, in any case, *vaciar of content #that in the that this relative majority did not assume the presidency.
In note of 7 April, that directed to Mr. *Priestley, #ours *jurisconsulto concluded: «censorship motion against the Commission #would be admissible to clear the juridical situation in the that finds and to limit more the exercise of powers, although it considers that value added, from sight point juridical, #would be quite feeble».
#would Wish to congratulate to the speakers for having reached incorporate #all the fundamental looks of this question: the situation of the greater persons in the labour market, his specific needs in the field of training, the questions related with his *sustento and needs regarding services.
The different costs of production of glucose in industries of #EE.UU. and of the European Union #can suppose usually among the 30 % and the 100 % of sale price, inconvenient that is impossible to surpass by means of the technological advance or the increase of productivity, even more taking into account that the majority of the #european industries suffer also of size disadvantage.
The recent evolution of the monetary variables, Mrs. *Metten, reinforce confidence of the economic agents and have to have positive repercussions, especially in the behaviour of the private investment, but *usted knows perfectly that I never comment the decisions of the Central Bank European, not to be accused of transgressing the *sacrosanto principle of independence.
Of course that it is still insufficient and #that is reason by the that have presented the *GOPE, precisely to put on the table an economic strategy, that follows from takes years, and like the speaker has underlined, there #be not reason to change of economic strategy, to the contrary, it is necessary to keep the course and *redoblar efforts to keep growth and struggle against unemployment.
The office did not has only function of the external control; #this is, definitely, very important, as States members are those who administer the 80 % of the community resources. The office will be also an independent guardian of the community interests in breast of organs and of the institutions of the Community.
The European Foundation for the Improvement of Conditions of Life and of Work *subscribió a memorandum of understanding with Health Agency and Security to avert duplication of functions, because #one of things in that it insists Parliament is the that it did not has to have duplication of functions in the work of these agencies.
#There is a big obstacle: the rule that the proposals of States members for the application of VAT reduced have to be approved unanimously by the Council, *cuando VAT no longer is the base for the contribution of States members to the European Union, argument that always was used to say that *vaciaba this base.
As a result of a decision of the Council of *Viena of the pasts 11 and 12 December, the Commission finishes to present to the European Parliament modification proposal of the Directive 78\/388\/*CEE relative to the possibility to apply, with experimental character, a type reduced of VAT on services of big intensity of hand of drama.
*Permítanme that add warning in relation with point: more important that an abstract decision, adopted in the negotiation table, on the definition of borders and #who #can or #can not coexist with #who, will be to impose fulfillment of norms -norms situated under the empire of the Right- and repress command of the massacres and the *puñales.
*Nos causes satisfaction the financial help and *macroeconómica of the World-wide Bank and #FMI, but the EU will have to adapt his economic and financial politics, because the humanitarian help #can not never compensate descent of export opportunities and counter the blockade of links and communications with the Union.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0267\/99) of Mr. *Rothley, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens, on decision project of the European Parliament relative to the Statute of deputies to the European Parliament (7528\/2\/99 - *C4-0217\/99-00\/0823(*COS)).
Regarding information before the celebration of agreement, the amendments occupy of information to consumers before celebrating agreement and the amendments refuse the concept of a right of reflection based in agreement project #such as it introduced it directive proposal.
The area of force covers to #all consumption products, so much new as of *segunda hand; the legal guarantee is of two years; in the cases of products of *segunda hand, States members will be able to decide, #if buyers and the sellers #can agree mutually limitation of guarantee time to a year.
The statute draft contained things profitable: a uniform wage that #would have made possible the payment of national taxes in the countries that like this had wished it, clear rules on statement of the interests of deputies, transparency in matter of repayment of costs and repayment of the real costs of trip.
With these supports, Parliament celebrated varied informal meetings with the Presidency of the Council and, with true satisfaction, have to stand out that the greater part of aspirations have been collected by the Council, until extreme that, after the European Council of *Berlín, has formulated a new proposal of regulation titled now, at last, «Regulation relative to the Financial Instrument of Orientation of Fishing».
In front of some initial and radical proposals directed to that the #european agriculture take more in account the indications of the market and the international references, finally has accepted *matizar terms and even exclude to #any of the sectors for reforming -as it is the case of the dairy products-, #whose reform postpones for the campaign 2005 and that surely will see meanwhile aggravated disequilibriums.
In front of the initial proposals to deepen relation among agriculture and environment to put end to #some deteriorations reported, like floor degradation and of water, attacks to biodiversity, etc., the Commission proposes in the horizontal regulation that are States members the that they define the compulsory environmental norms and general and determine sanctions, escaping like this of a community approach.
After having subjected the case to the Court of Justice, #this, abandoning jurisprudence *integracionista classical -that *perduró until the number of members got to nine-, limited to take a strictly formal interpretation of the texts, against #all logical and against the fundamental principles of a coherent juridical interpretation.
The Agreement is composed of three main axes: the institutionalisation of a political dialogue to the highest level; the extension and deepening of cooperation -to this *respecto foresees explicitly and for the first time cooperation in matter of human rights and democracy and include fields so important like the social, the fight against poverty, and the protection of the environment and of consumer.
From sight point more essential, believe that it basic, in this question, is that Parliament, the last day, pretends to subject during seven years to successor and to the successor of successor to a substantial limitation of the budgetary powers established in the Treaty, budgetary powers that Parliament exerts, in general, by qualified majority.
The Group *Europa of Nations has not voted positively the Report *Aglietta on execution competitions attributed to the Commission, mainly because the European Parliament treats to alter the sense of #some of the new disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to modify in own benefit the institutional balance.
Gentleman President, the resolution that finishes to approve the European Parliament on method that it #would be necessary to follow to reform the #european institutions after the Treaty of *Amsterdam did not contributes, in our opinion, improvement regarding the past, and will conduct, as of habit, to make operations of reform from up, without hardly have the initiative and the participation of villages of *Europa.
Is the culmination sure enough of a long process in the that Parliament and the European Union have exerted paper, in the that without place to doubts village of *Timor Oriental, with fight, has exerted paper determinant, but #can not leave to signal the importance of the diplomatic hit yesterday achieved by the Government of *Portugal in New *York.
In any case, in it that concerns to the European Union already *les have said that they have taken already #all disposals and *les announce more: already are to work, precisely to request of the #portuguese Government, in #any one of hypotheses, in the need to increase cooperation lines with the territory, of course respecting the popular will.
Was necessary to expect to that the Palestinians renounced to the military methods, to that heaved the civil disobedience by means of the *intifada and boarded patient negotiations with an enemy that had by fascist and racist, it was necessary to expect, as, to #all #this so that the Palestinians reached to advance and put in foot a peace process that has achieved now that a big part of the world was had to support his legitimate requirements to establish an independent State.
As *ustedes know, the Commission reacted immediately, communicating to State Boss Greater, Colonel *Azali *Assoumani, disapproval of the European Union and calling attention on the principles of cooperation, #whose essential elements are respect of the human rights, democracy and right State.
Have got to the following commitment: place that no exists a common position on the nomenclature, have been able to obtain a statement of the Council by the that promises to examine the position on said nomenclature, taking into account the amendments of the European Parliament and the results of discussions that at present carry out in the frame of a second exercise *SLIM.
In the Union only has to allow matter pertinent products of third countries #whose operators respect the social norms *promulgadas by the *OIT *atinentes to conditions and to the length of work, #as well as to the childish work, before that the Union impose norms in the global frame of the international agreements that negotiates and, in particular, of negotiation rounds of the *OMC.
will Have #all support of the Party of the European Socialists no only to effect the indispensable internal reforms -in *primer term, the statute of deputies and the of assistants-, but also to open wide open the windows of the institution to #ours *conciudadanas and to our *conciudadanos, in #all the *Europa of the Fifteen and further of borders, because no only are this palace, but also #one *Europa more joined.
#If we had not got to an agreement -and think in it that #would have meant, in the context of the beginning of war of *Kosovo and the crisis in the that found simultaneously the Commission, that the Summit of *Berlín had divided without getting to commitment-, *Europa #would have precipitated in a grave historical crisis.
*Me refer, of course, to the approval of Diary 2000, that went a political exercise, diplomatic and of balance of own interests inside the very difficult Union, and to #all the consequences that derived of the, maybe, greater problem of actuality, by repercussions inside the own European Union, that has been conflict of *Kosovo and #all the circumstances that have surrounded it and the consequences also that they derive for the future.
*Cuando the Western European Union finally disappear, in addition to the national Parliaments, it will be necessary to have Parliament that assume the #european responsibility and, in consequence, competitions in matter of external politics, of security and of defence will owe *recaer increasingly in the European Parliament, so as to that in the European Union any field remain to the *margen of Parliament and democracy.
The consolidation of peace broken in the legendary Field of the Blackbirds of *Kosovo *Polje demands that it exist an optimum collaboration among the international organisations involved, Nations Joined for the return of refugees, the *OSCE, of face to the democratic construction, and the European Union for the economic and social reconstruction.

In bottom is a species of natural disaster and in fact #would have to say: Are here in front of a subject for the European Administration; want to support defence that took Deputy *Thyssen so that the Commission was more generous in point and debate with Parliament on how act in front of this type of situations in the future.
Is very clear that it has to be explicit and #if it already is implicit do not see *cual is the problem to ensure that it was explicit place to measure that happens time the radioactive substances go to suppose an even greater danger and - as I finish to say - have had luck that even it have not produced a serious accident.
*Señorías, #if perhaps by contempt to the right of minorities, by the expression of a hegemonic will of the great groups, adopts *usted interpretation that go further of the letter, very clear without embargo, of Parliament, wish to call attention on the fact that it #would create a very important and hurtful precedent that #can go back *algún day against #any one of the groups or subgroups of this Assembly.
The meeting of the European Council in *Tampere days 15 and 16 October is a historical attempt of *esbozar a common politics of the European Union in the fight against the international delinquency organised, in the creation of a space of justice #european and in subjects of immigration and asylum.
To time know #which are the lean points of our credibility in front of the #european citizens. do not waste this opportunity to involve to the no governmental organisations and to each #one of citizens in gestation process of the Letter *sirviéndonos of an unknown formula to date.
Like this, is precise that Parliament, with the new attributions that *le conferred the Treaty of *Amsterdam, take #his the goal to advance to the creation of this space of freedom, security and justice respecting the national differences and taking always effort to approximate *Europa to citizens with clarity regarding the goals that pretends to achieve and to form as they transmit to the public opinion.
#This is case fully justified, no only because it is a system that is not prepared for the "effect 2000" , but that, besides, takes into account a migration of systems and, is more, is #all a complicated system that goes to cover from the *primer moment, from conception of the text, until the publication, without that it mediate any #another system, or was, that *yo believe that it is *algo that goes to leave to the Court of Justice in an optimum level for work.
The cause of the enormous current suffering of the *timorenses is clear: militias *proindonesias try to drown in blood bath the aspirations to a political independence of the big majority of the population. Attention!: is the most absolute negation of the result of the referendum of 30 August 1999.

Gentleman President, *señorías, reform of the *OMC «meat of *vacuno» represented #one of the delicate files of the new *PAC of the years 2000-2006 had account of the structural disequilibriums of the market of production, of the consequences of the phenomenon of cows crazy» in front of consumers and also of place that represents the *ganadería in occupation of the territory.
First: although I share the opinion that it is necessary to intensify politics for development of the rural areas, without embargo, a reduction of actions for the disadvantaged regions without an increase of credits, #would mean that we #would have to take credits of actions for development of the rural areas.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the problem of the *comitología poisons literally relations among Parliament and the Council, and even more: takes screen times in front of the public opinion, because the complexity of this mechanism of *comitología has reached to take denser the opaque mist of the taking of decisions in front of citizens.
treats of #one *segunda reading and in fact it that have tried is to consider the common position of the Council, *comparándola with the original proposal of the European Commission to the light of the evolution lived through the amendments proposed by Parliament -although no by me like speaker; *yo the supported later- and afterwards have believed necessary -again in narrow collaboration with the European Commission- present another series of amendments.
Gentleman President, the Commission of Public Freedoms and of Inner Subjects, in #whose name take part here, feared that the Council #would not reach to put of agreement on the relative decisions to the incorporation of the Agreement of *Schengen to the frame of the European Union in the planned term and that this juridical matter #would happen automatically to form part of the *tercer *pilar.
Have incorporated in amendment the request that the Annex *II vote as it elaborated in the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects and of Industrial Politics, since in my opinion, version of the Annex *redunda in benefit of development of the common market, of the inner market.
To the equal that occurs in competition, in States Joined, also here is necessary that it was State the that no only assume the costs of the fight against delinquency, but also the that it adopt the decisions around the strict norms and to the necessary technical possibilities to combat with firmness the cases of offence very grave.
Now well, *yo believe that in moment in that it debates the right of humanitarian interference, in moment in that it recognises that the international order has to have of instruments that allow to defend the fundamental human rights, in points in that they are flagrant and gravely violated, is definitely paradoxical that have delays in it that we #can consider a judicial instance of the right of interference, that #would be exactly #this.
It that are today here, in version that has examined the European Parliament, modifies the requirements of 1995 to end to include data on Internet users as they are the direction #IP, the electronic direction assigned to part, account number and direction of electronic post (*ENFOPOL 10951\/98 *REV2).
A protection, on the other hand, no free but in fulfillment of disposals, of some requirements established in norms that govern the World-wide Organisation of Trade and, on the other hand, in norms that the own European Union has given to govern trade with the third countries, with the countries in roads of development.
It that I want to say today in this partial period of inaugural sessions is that we expect can have the new President of the Commission, with President in exercise of the #finnish Council and, of course, with Mrs. *Fontaine, to continue this big work of support to the peace process and that #this was a priority in the visits of Speaker to *Irlanda of the North.
President of the Commission has signalled #some subjects, health of citizens, doping in sport and the aerial traffic to illustrate symbolically this attitude to program, although afterwards *me seems precipitated attention that offers to two points: the subject of reconstruction of *Kosovo and the Conference *Intergubernamental of *Helsinki.
To the equal that the majority of States members of the EU, the Commission is likewise of the opinion that the last modifications of the #turkish laws have opened the possibility that the procedure against Mr. *Öcalan and pronouncement of sentence transfer to a civil Court.
Is our firm purpose treat, from the reports of the Commission, to #all the countries candidates with the greater possible equality and pretend to adopt the pertinent decisions it more aptly possible, so that said countries #can *cerciorarse that they progress in negotiations in accordance with his own and real capacity, and that adhesion process evolves until form end just, efficient and answering to beneficial goals for #all.
Gentleman President, the Group *Europa of Nations considers absolutely unacceptable attitude of Commissioner *Bangemann, commissioned of telecommunications in the previous Commission -or in the current: no longer know exactly it that we have to say-, that finishes to accept place very well *remunerado in the administration council of society that corresponded before to the sector of competition.
Conclude saying that Mrs. *Laguiller took a very valuable contribution to this debate because, to the equal that #others, *dramatizó the subject perfectly attracting attention to the economic lagoons of society and form in that said divisions in fact serve to insist in that it is absolutely essential that the that have the big luck to occupy elective public charges and by nomination act with absolute honesty and discretion.
*Me #would enjoy *pedirle to Commissioner that elaborate politics that do not centre so much in putting fine to organisation that has *quebrantado #one or law, but that elaborate politics to control to the great organisations, to take that a World-wide or European Championship #can be party for citizens in general and no a commercial party.
But yes is the first time that the legal authority of competition has put end to fraud, has put end to the discriminatory sale, and is the first time that an authority of competition all over the world averts that in the future apply discriminatory methods in the sale of entrances.
Lady Speaker, believe that it is timely that, of form that have saved a minute of silence by the victims of the earthquakes in #Grecia and *Turquía -and with more reason because, with independence of the quantity of dead persons, has a very deep political meaning-, #would have to save, in this moment, a minute of silence by the victims of the #indonesian repression in *Timor Oriental.
Of mood guarantee that the complete review of the financial management of the Commission and control systems will be intensified, taking into account fully the specific recommendations made by the Committee on #all the questions including those posed by the that they have referred in the debate to subsidies and the rest of subjects.
*Cuando in the Report of Experts, that do not distinguishes on purpose among political and administrative responsibility, demands, among things, that President of the Commission has to possess faculty to resign to individual members of the Commission demand do not agrees, in my opinion, with the *gentlemens' *agreement among President *Prodi and Commissioners that have been designated.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the Report (To5-002\/99) of Mrs. #Jackson in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer on recommendation proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council (*COM(1988)0772 - *C4-0073\/1999 - 1998\/0358 (*COD) (before 1998\/0358(*SYN)) on minimum criteria of the environmental inspections in States members.
reform of the common politics of fishing, foreseen for the year 2002, will be a big challenge and a big proof that will have to confront this new Commission. Because the sector *pesquero expects of reform that politics *pesquera convert in an authentic common politics #european and that the Commission dowry of the community added value necessary.
Of way that, with reason, has delayed this morning the vote in measure in that it did not have of Record on the that it had to pronounce the Assembly, is very evident that will not be able to take it more that on disposal that appears in Record, that is disposal of general order and no on the particular conclusions that give off of *ello.
In our political assessment *reviste big importance program of the Commission that wants to value conquests of the past and deepen commitment in favour of peace and security, of stability and employment, of the welfare of #all Europeans, #as well as of the countries that are wall of *nosotros, in the east and the south.
Regret to say that Mr. *Busquin did not satisfy to the majority of the colleagues of the commission neither with answers on participation in ancient financial scandals neither with answers on competition for wallet neither on #if had the sense of responsibility and of suitable leadership to face up to the tasks that await to this Commission.
My Group receives with clear satisfaction in this context the statement of Mr. *Fischler in favour that the fundamental juridical acts relative to the general conception of orientation of the agricultural politics transact by the procedure of *codecisión and will to defend actively this position in the future Conference *Intergubernamental.
Lady Speaker, in spite of the brilliant intervention of Speaker of the Council, Minister *Halonen, have to call attention on secret that has surrounded the preparatory works of the meeting of *Tampere, thing that *ocasionó incident *grotesco the past week after the publication by the #danish diary *Berlingske *Tidenden of article, in the that it said that it #would try to reduce immigration from third countries, even through campaigns of *atemorización and threats.
statements, #as well as interventions of colleagues, situate by it that to collaboration among the European Parliament, the national Parliaments and the Council and the Commission refers, in a juridical field that houses an enormous danger. In concrete *me refer to the risk that legislation finish moving away of the #european citizens.
To finalise, the idea of #one *Europa that was not only market and only coin is very beautiful, especially of #one *Europa that it was a space of freedom, security and justice, but is important that this challenge win really so much to *través of the progressive strengthening of the community Institutions as boosting collaboration and cooperation among States members, more that resorting to decisions by qualified majority that did not represents of by himself\/hisself the solution to the problems.
Lady Speaker, *señorías, when taking the word in Parliament #few hours after the terrible accident, #can not leave to express publicly it very affected that it finds the #greek representation and it a lot that regrets the tragic loss in fulfillment of the have to of the *Viceministro of External Subjects of #Grecia, *Yannos *Kranidiotis, a big politician with #european vision that has loaned great services especially to the cause of peace and cooperation in the *Balcanes, to reconciliation among #Grecia and *Turquía.
Also want to appreciate the work of Subject Minister External of *Irlanda, Mr. *Andrews, like representative of Speaker of the Council in inspection of vote headcount in *Timor Oriental, #as well as the of Subject Minister External of Big *Bretaña, Mr. *Cook, that represented to Speaker of the Council in the meeting of the *APEC.
#If the fine public management is a fundamental previous requirement to loan help for development, why the fine public management did not has to be also a fundamental criterion for the international recognition, the bilateral relations and development of trade?
Think likewise that it also is important and it is necessary *recalcar the fact that today we owe *plantearnos the question of reconstruction of a social tissue, economic and morals in a context in that surely a wider vision of *Europa *suroriental #can not constitute element of division with regard to the elections of the Agency with headquarters in place instead of #another.
The Commission has made efforts to improve and take clearer the Agreement that today has in front of himself\/hisself the Assembly for consideration with seen to take his more transparent application and also to take into account disposals pertinent approved in the global agreement among the European Community and Nations Joined.
Instead, members of the Group Union by the *Europa of Nations have voted in favour of the group of the amendments, including the amendment 22, that limits the right of initiative of the Commission and that allows to the committee *ad *hoc establish agenda, records, #as well as interest statements of his own members.
Definitely the report of gentleman Commissioner *Kinnock has been exhaustive and important, nevertheless it is necessary to consider especially the political side of it that becomes in *Rusia in this moment, is to say, that #all #this will be able to *desestabilizar the international politics in the next period, #as well as the commercial relations of the Community with the own *Rusia, without thinking in the grave consequences that suffers the *empresariado community that has invested in this country.
Think that the Commission is very situated to take part to level, and had explains that the question of the #kosovar prisoners situates in the humanitarian plane, the European Union #can show *renuente in the sending of help to the #serbian authorities, while #this do not leave in freedom to #all the #kosovar prisoners.
In the Conference of Presidents, is to say, to Group Presidents, *les have said, with backrest of a big majority, that in this moment do not wish a resolution on the *OMC, because even *subsiste the need of debate, and now #would not have to elaborate a resolution in urgency procedure, because with *ello #one go to take wanted to here and there.
Takes fifteen days, the recent veterinary committee permanent of the Union took the decision to raise the embargo that weighed on exports of *vacuno #belgian. Has recognised in this way seriousness of proofs and severity of norms that, in actuality, imposes the #belgian Government.
Gentleman *Prodi, *nos upsets especially the fact that, these last years vital subjects for the human existence, related with the quality and security of foods #as well as with the protection of health of the #european citizens, jump continuously to the *primer flat of actuality through processes and mechanisms that do not guarantee always the validity and the credibility of information.
The European Parliament has underlined with frequency the importance of the adoption of measures in matter of energetic efficiency and the Council has underlined also the need of energy saving and a reduction of CO2 broadcasts in a series of resolutions.
As up to now the Community has not been able to put of agreement on #which is the most effective instrument for the reduction of gases *termoactivos -to know, taxation of energy consumption-, the Commission and the Council consider program *SAVE *II a "important and necessary instrument".
Expect, therefore, that companies of the sector of energy of States members of the EU that have a wide experience in projects related with the energetic efficiency #can transmit knowledges to these countries. Lady Commissioner, entrust in that said companies are considered like real candidates to hour to award agreements and do not see displaced by the North American companies.
Gentleman President, independently of the *calificativos that they #can use in #one or language, is true that negotiations on Trade Agreement have lengthened of an inconceivable form. As it remained of self-evident in #all a series of resolutions approved by this House, went a really shameful show, especially #if it takes into account that *Sudáfrica finished to make a very brave transition to a free and democratic Government.
Want to appreciate to Parliament and, in particular, to the speaker of Development Commission and Cooperation, Mrs. *Kinnock, form, fast and flawless, as it has taken the preparatory work for the approval of the *dictamen satisfied of Parliament on the result of negotiations with the #south african and by form, very active and *comprometidísima, as it has contributed to this process along the years.
Regarding the European Union, asked intervention of Fight Office against Fraud, the *OLAF, so that it invited to the #spanish judicial authorities to investigate #if the management and control of subventions community to crop of linen have been correct and #if there #be had performances that #can consider criminal.
Am new in this Assembly and wail that the first question #whose answer went to listen in this Assembly #can not be answered *oralmente by reasons of time, but wail doubly that *ello have to, precisely, to attitude of #some that, when arousing in this Assembly question that, in my opinion, are not for this Assembly, *nos deprive of the pleasure to listen to Mr. *Fischler talk today of the problem of bread of fishermen, for example.
Thus I request, lady Speaker, that write a letter in name of the European Parliament to Prime minister #british for *expresarle #ours weigh and horror by the magnitude of this terrible disaster, and *pedirle that transmit #ours deeper condolence to families of persons that have lost life, #as well as to the familiar of the that have resulted gravely injured together with the wish of a total recovery.
Gentleman Commissioner, the ball is in the field of *Turquía and is of here of #where has to come the following movement, because by part of *Europa already have had *bastantes things to encourage and do not see, by part of *Turquía, in the official field and no by part of village #turkish, that also is diet that *le has been imposed, the answer that need to give *nosotros the following step.
Like this, in our opinion, shows once again, that hypocrisy, in #all greatness, is #one of the basic principles of the European Union. politics of the two weights and the two measures, politics of the selective sensitivity in front of the human rights and in front of respect of the international Right.
politics of the two weights and the two measures, that bases in the political and economic interests of powers that govern in the European Union, *les takes to close the eyes in front of it that is *sucediendo in actuality in *Turquía. #This denies to democratisation, to respect to the human rights, violates #all the principles of the international Right.
Nevertheless, create important, by part, make immediately a study in depth, with the end to determine it more exactly possible the effects, in case, of this agreement in the economy of The Meeting and, on the other hand, establish a permanent mechanism of control able to create conditions for a fast intervention.
But #if here paper consists in reflecting worries, the *interrogantes and the expectations of our *conciudadanos #european, conserve in mind the world-wide dimension of the challenges, the challenges of the countries in development that today debate among hope of integration in the world-wide economy and fear to marginalisation.
In this field, said countries confront to a double difficulty: his internal markets are generally hoarded by monopolies or oligopolies, #whose *primer effect is the to take *repercutir in the local consumers, and mainly in the poorest, some too much high prices, whereas the second effect is the to block the arrival of new countries and of *obligarlos to confine in the informal economy.
since Mr. *Sasi has had friendliness to accept the invitation to the meeting of Industry Commission, External Market, Investigation and Energy of the European Parliament of 12 October, suggest that it present his official answer to these two points in the frame of the meeting.
do not go to follow making assessments here to the *respecto, but believe that the reduction of CO2 is not an optional charge but that has also an economic effect and offers the opportunity to paginate the improvement of quality of life with employment, by it that think that it do not has to defend the negotiate on some boundless broadcasts.
Therefore, *le offer another opportunity to answer: thinks the Council order an audit of States members to determine how States have a discriminatory legislation against lesbians and *gays, that do not guarantee right equality, equality of civil rights to lesbians and *gays and that do not offer protection in virtue of the law to lesbians and to *gays?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, will not have need of three minutes for *expresarles the fundamental importance of the subject of the resolution that subjects to our approval, relative to the code in matter of export of arms, for the extension of peace zone and of stability in the world, it that certainly constitutes #one of the most important mandates that have received of constituents.
(*FR) The fact to reduce drastically gas broadcasts that cause the effect *invernadero by part of the rich countries is a duty of solidarity in front of the future generations, but also in front of the populations of the countries in roads of development, that will suffer every time with greater hardness the natural catastrophes caused by the climatic change.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0036\/1999) of Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the agreement *interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by Fight Office against Fraud.
Is necessary, without embargo, underline once again sensitivity that distinguishes to the House, sensitivity that distinguishes to the European Parliament in the subject of fraud, sensitivity materialised in the internal decision of the European Parliament, and sensitivity that besides renews, *reformula in the report and in the proposal of Mr. *Napolitano.
has posed a question to #that *respecto but believe that the resolved satisfactorily in the parliamentary commission with transaction amendment presented by Mr. #Gil-Oaks and by me, in the that specifies that the application of this agreement *interinstitucional do not lessens any legislative disposal neither of Regulation regarding the obligation to respect confidentiality concerning deputies.
To judge by the analysis that has taken Mr. *Ferri is evident that are of legislation in matter of vehicles of engine no only in the #european plane but in plane of the Economic Commission for *Europa of Nations Joined, that during years has been recognised by the car industry like entity that establishes #all a range of world-wide norms.
#This is reason by the that proposed, with support of Budget Commission, group #all politics and the relative budgetary lines to the creation of this space of freedom, of security and of justice under an only title, with five chapters that correspond to the great political directed to the realisation of the space of freedom, of security and of justice.
reason advanced to try justify these dark cuts is the unforeseen apparition of new priorities totally legitimate in principle, like help to reconstruction of *Kosovo, the contribution to the *edificación of *Timor oriental at last released, solidarity with the victims of the earthquake of *Turquía and finance of fishing agreement with *Marruecos.
Mr. *Bourlanges has confronted to a double paradox: the of a debate on the budget that occupies of costs but no of entrances and the of a budget subjected to the double and *contrapuesta pressure of the increase of the tasks of the European Union and of the objective decrease *tendencial of the percentage of the #european #GDP that *transita to *través of the budget of the Union.
has said here that the goal *prioritario is inflation, but is not the only: have to talk, among things, of an economic pole, of responsibility, of the international representation of the euro and of supervision of the banking institutions in moment of great fusions among the financial institutions.
This principle involves that we have to confront together the grave world-wide problem of drugs, in each #one of links of the chain, is to say, production, distribution, consumption, money wash, deviation of the chemical precursors and the sale of arms.
State Bosses or of Government recognised, like this, the obligation to respect the solemn commitment that assumed in *Tampere. The Commission, basing in dialogue and cooperation with the European Parliament, is had to take all it possible to reach that it was a reality a Space of Freedom, Security and Justice, above #everything, balanced in his three components: freedom, security and justice.
Parliament wished, of course, that in this Summit reached #european commitments more ambitious, but, frankly, is very positive that these important questions appear now in the #european diary with a frame, with a clear order for the European Commission and also, therefore, with a mission for the European Parliament, by it that I want to congratulate to the Presidency and, especially, to the Commission.
Finally, in moment in that it finishes to be born company committee "*Michelin", has to modify the community legislation so that employees or representatives, affected by plans of collective dismissal by economic reasons, #can promote judicial actions without expecting to that pronounce on dismissal the competent territorial jurisdiction and impugn the foundation of this decision.
Consider that in level, by means of the general frame of lines economic guidelines, or of lines guidelines for employment, have things that learn; no only in the national field, but also, #if *ustedes prefer, #can have a *benhmarking, information exchange and of models applied with hit to national level to solve this terrible problem of restructurings that, of course, will have it in front of *nosotros in #all the sectors.
Are based in an entirely realistic assessment, according to the *cual *Europa, that is place with strong social powers, *cuando no have social cohesion will suffer social conflicts, and the social conflicts will have immediate consequences in the economic stability, is to say, in the indispensable surroundings for development of competition and of companies.
look by the that seat special interest is negotiation with hit of program *multilateral of environment and nuclear security. tries to guarantee that western donors provide technical assistance and financial help for storage and the elimination of nuclear waste in Northwest of *Rusia, #all these terrible nuclear submarines that *oxidan, #as well as the rest of nuclear waste.
To finish, wanted to underline that in society oriented to the telematic networks and Internet and that invests increasingly in utilisation for the communication, information and services, is quite ridiculous that the Council have not accepted the amendments in *pro of the creation of spot Internet totally devoted to youngsters.
treated to know #if it created line by key action, as it had established Budget Commission, or #if it kept a global line for investigation, as it wished the executive Commission, to change that they gave guarantees regarding information on bottom movement among the key actions inside line.
#If the #ours is the Institution that, with security, has made the greater efforts in the fight against fraud in the Institutions of the European Community, how go to understand citizens that the only persons to the that do not affects the *OLAF to effects of internal investigations are deputies of the European Parliament?
How device has foreseen, gentleman Commissioner, in case that it have a blockade of the situation, so that fuselages directly affected, so that #all #that that take part in the sector *pesquero, so that the regions involved and, in particular, the zones of the goals 1 and 2, that depend of fishing, as it expresses our common resolution, do not accuse of front the catastrophic consequences that tended the no renewal of the agreement?
The sector *pesquero that affects to Realm of *Marruecos is formed by small employers, by *armadores to the *cuales *les results absolutely impossible to create mixed companies of #moroccan majority and, therefore, the type of new agreement has to be an agreement *continuador, modifying the necessary clauses, of the agreement in this existent moment, taking into account that -how no- *nosotros respect that this agreement benefit to the economic and social development of *Marruecos.
And take it by economic reasons, that already have explained varied of orators that have taken part in this Assembly, but also, to similarity of it that *sucedió yesterday in the debate on Fishing Agreement among the European Union and *Marruecos, by reasons of help to a country that, in spite of being rich in natural resources, is poor by fault of the political situation in that it finds and, in particular, of the climate of war.
In spite of an absolutely essential rejection the past month of June, without going more far, in the elections to the European Parliament of the *lejanía and of the *secretismo of our institutions collectively, this first meeting of the next week will increase the democratic deficit, in the sense that Parliament will remain excluded and do not seems to have a valid reason for *ello.
In this case have added an additional disposal in the that will ask a review to cape of five years in the that they take part the two parts of industry in the #european level to see how works diet in this sector, with particular reference to health and security of workers interested.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the oral question (*B5-0032\/1999) of Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market, on the Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council titled "Strategy for the realisation of the only market European" .
According to my experience, #this also affects in particular precisely to the relative subjects to legislation in matter of protection of consumer, in the that with big frequency there #be had contradictions among the different managerial and among the different norms of #european field, for example in the determination of complaint terms or protection terms of consumer, that often have varied.
First: how go to convert in effective the only market #if States tend to adopt protectionist measures - have seen #some cases, even lately - and how pretends the Commission use better infringement procedure converting it in faster and encouraging to citizens and associations to report rapes of the community Right that register daily in the distinct States members?
The plans of the Commission to take a more strict follow-up of efforts and the results obtained in the field of the national politics are *bienintencionados, but *me fear that *surtirán the contrary effect. Especially #if it opts by a quantitative method that consists in adding the number of measures, instruments of support and projects of creation of employment.
But there #be more: #can not treat only of moderation *salarial and of flexibility like #such, because #this *desvirtuaría character and the spirit of the national dialogues, the maintenance of the social protection and #all the programming instruments negotiated in the territory, sensitive no only to small and medium enterprise, but also to these sectors more *congeniales to tradition and to characteristics of the territory.
Likewise, the document not even mentions paper of an active politics of credits to support to company - in this sense, the system *crediticio European follows being to years light of the American - and believe that efforts of the European Union and of States members for *darle a distinct orientation have been to date very scarce.
And, although it is *algo that do not says in high voice, this problem is linked to the own luck of democracies, as, as history *nos teaches, democracies do not base so only in wealth production, but that health depends also of a wide distribution that has to reach to the big majority of the population, and #this is thing that in the contemporary societies involves to guarantee employment.
Report (To5-0048\/1999) of Mrs. *Quisthoudt-*Rowohl, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the relative Council to the conclusion of Agreement of scientific cooperation and technological among the European Community and the Russian Federation (*COM(1999) 324 - *C5-0083\/1999 - 1999\/0133(*CNS))
Report (To5-0045\/1999) of Mr. *Menrad, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on decision proposal of the Council by the that creates the Employment Committee (*COM(1999) 440 - *C5-0173\/1999 - 1999\/0192(*CNS)) and on the proposal of the Commission of guidelines for employment politics of States members in the year 2000 (*COM(1999) 441 - *C5-0147\/1999 - 1999\/0816(*CNS))
An important reason is, to mood to see, that to Europeans, in contrast with the Americans in general *nos is missing risk attitude and fault also a positive motivation in the population that contribute to that through a good economic growth reach also a positive politics of employment in *Europa and in the national states.
Need laws simpler and, especially, do not have to commit error -even in this Assembly- to create so much in the national plane as by means of #european norms, by means of regulations or by means of directives, #one *superreglamentación that treat to the population like herd and, consistently, #this shop in definite to not running risks, to not taking independent, to not undertaking active occupations, but to act rather in a field ensured, which at the end *nos goes to conduct to a new vertiginous increase...
The directive on the improvement of the quality of fuels #as well as technician, already existent, of the catalysts allow in point to the Council and to Parliament an absolutely ambitious project, without overloading with taxes to industry and to the sector of transport.
program *Daphne 2000-2003 goes to be an extremely important instrument in the fight against violence and will procure value added to the local actions, regional and national in this field by means of the creation of networks, information exchange, better practical and cooperation, and a greater awareness of society in general.
In #day of the new #millenium, gentleman President, #can say that support *vigoroso of the European Parliament to program will be the best and clearer of the signs that the Union awards the maximum political priority to the effective fight against violence that suffer boys, teenagers and women.
Gentleman President, this year fulfils the *décimo anniversary of the Convention of Nations Joined and is an opportunity *inmejorable for the European Parliament and for the Commission, no simply to pronounce #some solemn speeches on this anniversary, but mainly for *decidirnos to act more, to facilitate but resources and to take initiatives and measures that constitute politics integrated and *conectiva that protect with efficiency the human values and the dignity of boys.
Is, clearly, the base of a healthy budgetary administration. Without embargo have to underline that the budgetary discipline do not has to constitute end in #if same and do not has to cancel the correct and effective application of the essential disposals of the community legislation, neither neither in this case, touch the basic principles of the *PAC.
To5-0057\/1999 of Mr. *Gebhardt, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, on regulation proposal (*CE) of the relative Council to competition, recognition and the execution of judicial resolutions in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^99<num>$^)<rpar>$ ^220<num>$  ^*C$­^0045<num>$/^1999<num>$  ^1999<num>$/^0110<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>.
The goal of the regulation is to guarantee that the resolutions on divorce and other forms of separation that have produced in States members are recognised with rapidity by the States members and besides provide some suitable rules to times and unitary in it *tocante to the parental responsibility by the common children of spouses.
In reality, #would have to work in favour of a global agreement in this field, without embargo, with this initiative step in this path, as no fits doubt of the big importance -point in the that have been in general #all agreement orators- that we recognise the resolutions of the other in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility, especially in a period like the that live now, in the that the familiar structure is violent transformations.
Before the presentation of a proposal of concrete action to #that *respecto, the Commission asked, basing in the quoted communication, to States members, in level of the Council, and to the European Parliament that communicated observations on points tackled in the communication on the protection of the victims of delinquency.
Am safe that the Commission goes to guarantee coherence of the external politics and of the inner politics of the Union -of programs *transfronterizos and of help programs to development- and that it also is of the interest of States *beneficiarios of cooperation *transfronteriza -*Marruecos and *España- that advance proposed that they correspond to worry.
*Yo believe that #if we fulfil with our committed in European quality, will contribute to strengthen the group of the Alliance of the Atlantic North and #if from here assume these tasks, #such as they finish to manifest Gentlemen #Solana and *Patten, and *usted, gentleman #Solana, also engages to have a conversation with *nosotros, as already it takes it the Commission, always that we consider it necessary, #can have security that my Group will be to side.

Nevertheless, news that agents negotiators of the European Commission informed hardly a week before the agreement of States Joined that dismissed the possibility of adhesion #chinese in a next future *nos carries to think that the European Union has not negotiated with conviction that #would fit to expect.
Report (To5-0057\/1999) of Mrs. *Gebhardt, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on regulation proposal of the Council (*COM(1999) 220 - *C5-0045\/1999 - 1999\/0110(*CNS)) relative to competition, recognition and the execution of judicial resolutions in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children
Parliament, that has had an important paper in this process, in addition to cheer by development of events in *Irlanda of the North, #would have to involve in effort so that the #others two violent conflicts that *subsisten in breast of the Union -the of *Córcega and, especially, the of the Basque Country- walk by the *senda of the definite peace.
Gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President of the Council, no only want to direct attention to the environmental damages caused in *Europa by pertinent products of countries, but that also loan greater attention to treatment methods and production employed in countries and that no only debate the subject of identification, but also the possibility to adopt commercial measures that allow to avert environmental damages all over the world.
Said decision no only condemns to the inhabitants of *Yugoslavia to happen winter *carentes completely of the necessary means of heating, after the enormous *destrozos caused in the public infrastructure by bombardments of NATO, but that affects of mood *provocador to pride of #all village, that results victim of blackmail and the annihilation because Occident do not approves to his political leader.
Imagine that they #can open investigations to deputies in virtue of grave facts tied to the exert of functions a juridical concept created #ex *novo, indeterminate and contrary to the constitutional tradition of the fifteen States members, that #can open investigations #if deputies break analogous obligations to the derivative of the disciplinary Right of civil servants, a disciplinary Right of civil servants of the that *carecemos, some similar obligations that no exist!
Like this, take a call to States members, to the institutions of the European Union and to #all the international community so that they keep in the agenda #all support to village of *Timor Oriental, initiate the steps for the international recognition of State of *Timor Oriental and the establishment of the diplomatic relations with *él.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the one who at the beginning of this year #can not more with the murders, expulsions, the *saqueos and pillages that the army and militia #serbian carried out in *Kosovo and in virtue of reasons pronounced in favour of a called humanitarian intervention, has to ask now #if war -that alas did not go directed against the that committed crimes but against the #yugoslav population-, war that lasted more of two months and half and that cost varied thousands of millions of euros, really gave the result that expected.
In my opinion, the letter of fundamental rights requires a debate in depth. Create, besides, that the right of boys #can not *desvincularse of the right of parents, of the rights of family and of education right of parents in family.
fight politics against drug - *me direct to the Commissioner of Inner Security - means, as, by side of the reduction of offer also a consistent persecution of drug suppliers, especially in the sector of money bleaching.
To time, are different relations that have to board among the Union in group and action of each #one of States members, among subsidiariness principle and the need, that nevertheless has precisely affirmed, that the Union endow of a common politics with regard to this phenomenon that concerns for real our present, but especially our future.
Is register system and comparison system, an instrument, in definite, that *nos helps in the fight against the illegal immigration and type of illegal entrance in the country, #as well as also against commission of acts criminal low false identity.
Have the obligation to remember that this constant current of illegal immigration represents an enormous charge, in particular in cities of the interior, for our national services of health, our social services and system of social security, in addition to exerting strong pressure on the limited number of houses available.
In any case, *nos seems fundamental that the next review of the Treaty consecrate the European Bank of Investments like institution fully community, subject to supervision of the Court of Accounts and of the European Parliament and that no answer only in front of a general assembly of States members, as at present it pretends.
Have taken an analysis in depth, with detail, and, in accordance with information available, on the base of suppositions of maximum utilisation there #be a remainder still in the year 1999 of 33 millions of euros, of 8,7 in the 2000, of 7 millions -roughly- in the 2001 and, although it is true that in the year 2002 the situation will be absolutely adjusted, go back to exist remanent in the 2003.
To mood to see, #if all it that *usted has exposed, #everything it that has to present in the Council of *Helsinki, has truly sense, the unavoidable conclusion is that the European Union #can not occupy only of sentences like the of the case *Bosman or of looks of competition in the field of sport, but that it has to give value to sport quoting it sure enough in the Treaty.
In the subject of the Conference *Intergubernamental, believe that after the turn of Prime minister of country, lady Speaker, no fits a so optimistic situation; #would be pity lose this opportunity to give impulse to the project of #european integration and *nos *arrepentiremos of not taking advantage of as it is owed occasion.
#Many of his *Señorías have mentioned it, have posed it in reiterated occasions to Parliament and repeat it today: believe that, in parallel to the culmination of enlargement -that is an irrefutable reality, since enlargement that will decide, expect, in *Helsinki is enlargement that did not poses doubts neither problems neither vacillations- will have to open a debate on nature and characteristics of *Europa, since we will be *nosotros the that will establish these limits, the that will decide nature of *Europa: #can not simply answer to the, of by himself\/hisself legitimate, appeal of the countries that ask to go in in *Europa.
The *tercer change that it wanted to signal is that Minister #turkish of European Integration and Human Rights -that has a very curious combination of competitions, that without embargo marry well- finishes to declare officially, after ratification of death conviction by the Court of Appeal, that the execution of this conviction no #would favour the interests of *Turquía.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0076\/1999) of Mrs. Towers Mark, in name of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects, on the report of the Commission to the Council (*COM(1999)174 - *C5-0108\/1999) 1999\/2111(*COS)) on the length of the transitory period for the introduction of the euro.
Still is a lot, in view of that prices of herring in the Community in this moment are lower that never, owing to saturation of the market of the EU with cheap fish and herring frozen of Norwegian, and of the establishment, by part of companies #german, of units of production of low cost in *Polonia, to process the #norwegian fish free of taxes for export to *Alemania.
Regarding enlargement of negotiation to #all speakers, included the countries in roads of development, the European Union adopted also the initiative to initiate the conference with the *ofrecimiento to guarantee to the less advanced countries a wide access with rights invalid to the markets of the countries industrialised.
Like the liberal politician that am, maybe a #european politician very liberal, wanted to say that in breast of the EU #would have to think in form to modify units of agricultural production and the future of Diary 2000, in addition to study how delete subventions that affect to trade.
In 1995, indirectly, through amendment that presented accepted adult training in program #Socrates *I. From here also has developed along the year in #all *Europa the wish by adult training and by the continuous learning so that *nos is possible to say that the answer *sustentada by branch *Gruntvig of program #Socrates is the correct answer.
In terms of the capacity of program to be spear tip of values of Parliament, hit has been enormous. is fundamental for the expansion of the educational capacity of youngsters, no only in terms of his cultural capacity, but also in terms of his economic base.
The European Union always has been pioneering in the cessation of production and of the employment of harmful substances for ozone coat and Parliament has been the environmental political consciousness of this European Union.
Gentleman President, in the first place wanted to say it a lot that admire work that the speaker has made in this report; already was quite difficult that surpassed the first reading in Parliament and has been even more difficult in the *segunda reading, because there #be had points of divergent sight, contradictory scientific opinions and pressures from the distinct groups of interest of the sector with regard to determined substances.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the conjoint debate on the meeting of the European Council of days 10 and 11 December in *Helsinki and the statement of the Presidency in exercise of the Council on activity semester of the Presidency #finnish, #as well as on the situation in *Chechenia and on the Summit of the *OSCE.
In the course of treatment of the budgets has incorporated a new game of costs that includes, first, 500 millions of euros for *Kosovo proposed by the summit of the European Union and, afterwards, 190 millions of euros in concept of Fishing Agreement with *Marruecos, *Turquía and other complementary subjects, it that represents in total 700 millions of euros, or was, the 15 percent of the financial forecasts of section.
So as to reduce estimate of the corresponding costs to enlargement -the financial frame of *Berlín includes, in effect, costs from the year 2000-,go to propose likewise to the Commission that make a permanent evaluation of the economic situation and of the necessary costs for enlargement that of #this give off.
Therefore, from the point of financial sight, the new period of programming 2000-2006 will be able to initiate and like this will take, in effect, with a new program, in the that it has taken to state on purpose that helps with charge to the structural Bottoms have to contribute to boost likewise equality of opportunities among men and women, protection goal of the environment and employment.
In narrow articulation with this communication, the Commission has approved also #another, accompanied of decision proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council and of decision proposal of the Council, relative to support program to the #european audiovisual industry, program MEDIATES PLUS 2001-2005.
treats to prepare to *Europa so much in plane of infrastructures as in the of industry of program production, for the imperative of the digital era, it that means, of course, accept that *Europa has an ambition in matter of participation in the new digital economy and in the new society of culture, information to scale world-wide.
Therefore, is better that, in place of *fijarnos a more ambitious program that probably #would pose difficulties in matter of subsidiariness and maybe had the effect to reduce the general enthusiasm, follow applying a strategy directed to encourage to States members so that they take advantage of to the maximum the opportunity to learn -and apply- the initiatives adopted in the #european countries in general.
In 1996 an evaluation of the repercussions of the two programs of positive action with seen to the achievement of equality of opportunities in the Commission revealed that it had had important changes in the situation of the feminine personnel in Category To and in direction places, in particular to consequence of the dip annual adopted by the Commission.
Like this, apart from the protection to the scientific specialists that have the technical knowledges and do not have to be carried by tortuous paths owing to knowledges or of his economic weakness; believe that, go in in a logic of political conditions on it that happens or leaves to happen in regions, is condition *sine *qua *non for the countries candidates to adhesion.
Subject: Venues of game The Court of Justice has recognised that, in the field of application of the Treaty *CE, game organisation of chance constitutes an economic activity of provision of services, #if well with precision that disposals of States members to authorise the opening of venues of game have to be provided and no discriminatory (Subject *Schindler *C-275\/92).
harmonisation in the sphere of the application of the national penal right and of the administration of justice in States members presupposes, necessarily, harmonisation of legislation on the fight against fraud and #any one other illegal activities in the community budget.
Memory that, after revolution, like minister of External Subjects, *me gathered in Nations Joined with Subject minister External of Chinese and worry of minister #chinese of External Subjects of then was the to say "for *nosotros, *Macao is not colony; therefore, *ustedes, that are decolonisation, do not touch *Macao; in moment, already *regularizará" .
Gentleman President, my answer goes to develop around two axes: the first refers to it *sucedido until today from the Conference of *Beijing and to how the European Union has supported actions contemplated in the common platform then adopted; and the second, to Parliament paper by it that *atañe to Nation meeting Joined foreseen for the summer of the 2000.
Far to hail this effort in favour of the protection of the environment, the European Union only has a goal in the bilateral negotiations with Swiss: force to that this country renounce to regulation, with the pretext that it hinders the free competition and that it boosts deal inequality among #european territories.
#would not have won time, by the contrary, beginning by the principle, being more modest and loaning greater attention to the opinions of citizens and of villages that are not very convinced of the balance of #this *OMC, of the results of realisations regarding the *agravación of development inequalities among the North and the South?
These twelve partial fields of interest will be examined in the following groups under the titles *mainstreaming generals: gender in politics of development, is to say as it takes part equality among sexes in collaboration of the European Union with the countries in development, the participation of women and the human rights.
#If it fits still add *algo to the previous answers, #can signal that #one of the causes of delays of flights is that, in the current system, planes do not obtain takeoff permission until it have not confirmed the green light of landing in destination airport.
States members of the EU have engaged to adopt an effective politics of no proliferation of armament and to take part in control systems of export, or was, in actions that carry out in the frame of the Committee of the group *Zanger of exporters of the nuclear sector, of the group *Australia and of the mechanisms *Wassenaar.
In conclusion, expect that the Council manifest firmness that the European Parliament for *salvaguardar and promote the system of the only price of book, that, as it signals our resolution, treats of the best system to improve production and the distribution of literary dramas, without deleting competition.
Gentleman President, *me take echo of the opinions of the two previous orators when giving the sincerest welcome to resolution proposal to condemn unambiguously the *tremendo #record of rapes of the human rights of the #taliban diet Afghan, and in particular persecution of women #afghan in the name of religion and of culture.
Nevertheless, help appeals to agriculturalists in help form in front of natural disasters #can examine in the frame of article 33 of the Regulation (*CE) *nº 1257\/99, of the Council, of 17 May 1999, on help to the rural development to charge of the European Bottom of Orientation and of Agricultural Guarantee.
Without embargo, have to signal that the procedure is not ideal, Mrs. *Doyle and the deputies have reason, but the problem to the that *nos confront in the Commission of Regional Politics, Transports and Tourism that is the competent commission, is that the Council *nos asks urgency in the last minute because, somewhere, somebody has given account that we need a resolution of Parliament to continue with Bottom in question.
By reason *yo also agree in that we have to unify it more possible statistics on movement, politics and commercialisation of our agricultural products and that it #would be well that did not have State, at least in statistics, a distinct representation of the relative facts to our agricultural economy.
In the economic terrain, in the past exercise *Polonia has experienced a high index of annual growth, as it already has said Mrs. *Hoff, with a reduction of unemployment and of inflation, a stable coin and growth of the direct foreign investments.
From Parliament have defended always the institution of Defender of Village, as *garante of the protection of the rights of citizens to hour to report cases of possible bad administration by part of the institutions and community organs, and the need to intensify relations among said institutions and citizens.
divulging action has to be carried out by the community institutions through the media and audiovisual, and like this #would avert, among other consequences, that, for example, more of the 69 % of claims presented in front of Defender in the last years were out of the field of competition as, for example, the big number of *ellas that have like object restrictions to the free circulation, and that present every year in front of Defender.
To end to amend the current informative deficit in the field of the rights of citizens of the EU urge to services of Parliament and of the Commission to that they set up direct lines of query in the different States members and that take advantage of in depth the possibilities offered by the telematic and technology of information.
It true is that, after the European Council, the 25 % goes back to the pockets of States members, but the idea of the criteria of common execution follow being absolutely essential and to #that *respecto will ask to Commissioner how repercussions has had, in his opinion, the European Council concerning attitude of the authorities *aduaneras common and #if they are now less concerned that before.
*Nosotros defend the rights of the human person against the rights of an inhuman and totalitarian State that launches by routes of exile to a population *aterrorizada, destroys the houses, threat and kills to women and boys; *nosotros defend freedom and wish that the criminal are punished; therefore we support without reservation the brave decision of State Bosses and of #european Government.
For wanting to play with the international borders -the of *Yugoslavia from 1991, the of *Macedonia and of *Albania tomorrow-, for ignoring the lessons of history, for pretending *desconocer paper of *Rusia in this region, for looking for a military punishment more that a political solution, for wanting to especially suppress to village #serbian of this *Europa by the that has worked so much, go to cause probably the *conflagración that simulate to want to avert.
Besides, the resolution proposal affirms that Nations Joined and the Security Council « have not been able to» (!) take part in the decision of NATO on the aerial incursions, although it is clear that this decision has taken breaking the principles of Nations Joined, that in this case have seen humiliated and abused of form *irremediable.
Are dangerous postures of frivolous advisers on the editorial of the resolution proposal, that *envilecen effort serious for building order and a really international community, that #can apply of plausible and viable form principles, without selective interventions and without the illogical utilisation of violence.
The Commission is in total agreement with gentleman speaker with regard to that, nevertheless progresses reached with regard to the realisation of an only market of the financial services, sales *transfronterizas of financial products to the by minor to consumers follow being more the exception that the rule inside the European Union and continue existing still disparities of price very considerable among States members.
Agree with the speaker in that for regulation authorities and of supervision, said advances represent new challenges that #can confront through cooperation and effective coordination among the financial authorities of regulation and of supervision, with a clear cast of supervision responsibility and with financial regulations solid, necessary to manage the global institutional risk, #as well as the risk of the systems.
Like this as, #if today we have to give a fast and effective answer to the problems posed, is to say, indemnify to families of the victims and *darles a moral and material support, #as well as pipe the influx of traffic that, because of the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, converges to the tunnel of the *Fréjus; also it is necessary to consider the question as a whole.
Of these seven millions, five allocate to the electoral information by means of the *ONG, is to say, to the electoral training and to information, and two millions to the sending of some sixty observers by States members to Indonesian by a period of two weeks, but in the frame of the electoral observation wider organised, among organisations, by Nations Joined.

285 members of parliament have gathered in group that pretends to reestablish Parliament #would not be positive that the European Union loaned all backrest, so that Parliament, that was dissolved in moment, have the opportunity to collaborate from another perspective in the preparation of a constitution that modify deeply, once and for all, the #burmese situation?
Of side, wail deeply the murder in cold blood of woman that put his personal life and professional to service of defence of the human rights, and of #another, *me saddens to have to check that here in the European Union, to the equal that in the rest of the world, determined strengths try to undermine with terrorist acts a peace process in course.
The direction of the administrations *aduaneras from the EU is #one *intromisión in the national sovereignty that did not has to take place.2.The decisions adopted in the past by the EU have weakened the border controls among States members, favouring the illegal activities and boosting commodity circulation of smuggling.
The juridical protection of the rights of consumers has to follow being competition of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens and the rights of consumers have to follow being competition of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer, as it finishes to explain Mr. *Collins.
The social speakers, the governmental organisations, States members and the EU have to take, each #one in field of responsibility, the timely countermeasures, is to say, coordinating and collaborating *sensatamente in the relative subjects to the third age in the EU and not acting *centralizadamente each #one from field of responsibility.
Without embargo, exists a field related with the third age that presents great difficulties to hour to introduce improvements, so much from a point of concrete sight as by means of the #european cooperation. *Me am to the reciprocal recognition of social provision -like subsidies by illness and pensions- that affect in numerous occasions to the greater persons.
Gentleman President, the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of Parliament proposes, in effect, subject to the executive Commission the problem of deficit of the European Union in vegetal proteins inside feeding allocated to animals and the strategic challenge that comports this situation for biotechnologies in the *Europa of the Fifteen.
Today, really, did not has felt that they still exist *muchísimas differences among representatives and #others, *cuando the reality is that, from the Treaty of *Maastricht and, more still, of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, goes opening step the reality of this #european citizenship that demands to voices that representatives take part of a common diet in #all looks, but, of course and in particular, in look of the suspension of the parliamentary immunity.
*Usted agrees that the examination of the *anejo *V in our commission began with a letter of Mrs. *Theato, speaker of the Commission of Budgetary Control, that tackled specifically the question of #if article 5 of this *anejo *V that foresees the absolute majority to refuse the approval of the management, was compatible with disposals of the Treaty.
new Earth were also the plans of national action and, to the contrary of orator that *me has preceded, *yo believe that the guidelines of *Luxemburgo and the plans of national action, among things, have derived of the fact that have unemployment tax lower.
No #would treat to concede today the approval of the management to the Commission, against of it that the Council has taken acting with lightness and *despreocupación, since, as so well has explained *Laurens #Jan *Brinkhorst, #would not have to concede the approval of the management to a Commission *dimisionaria that no longer is qualified to assume commitments on future orientations in front of the #european Parliament.
On the other hand, the fact that measures do not affect to #all the countries of the European Union supposes a grave distortion of the rules of competition in the only market, aggravating the negative consequences on companies that yes will see affected by these high tariffs imposed by States Joined in sanctions.
The political solution that try to reach is a political solution that suspend the use of strength on the base of respect of the human rights, of the common security, of the return of #all refugees, on the base of the international community of nations.
In interest of the agreement, consider that *ello is admissible always that exceptions limit in measure of it possible and suppose a step to the creation of an only and uniform Statute and, especially, serve to reach the establishment, it before possible, of reward diet equal for #all deputies to the European Parliament.
Therefore, the preliminary draft of general budget has to postpone the subject of the possibility to hire new personnel and his previous endowment until they remain clear the *márgenes that possibly have in the frame of the new institutional agreement and until the new Commission have the opportunity to define requirements.
Fulfilled the community juridical obligation to approve a new directive to replace the directive cancelled, to trial it more important, is a vital step to a common frame to differentiate the systems of *gravámenes in the group of the European Union.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the goal of the proposal is to facilitate sale by telephone, by *fax and by Internet of financial services #such as banking, insurances, investments and credits *hipotecarios, protecting at the same time to consumer against fraud, against the high pressure of sale arguments and against #some uses no requested of communication technicians to distance.
Therefore, in quality of member of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer, always have supported, to pair of Mrs. *Kuhn and Mr. *Whitehead, measures that guarantee that it provides a real protection adapted to the needs and worries of consumers thanks to the #european legislation.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0124\/99) of Mrs. *González *Álvarez, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer, on decision proposal of the Council by the that creates action program community in favour of the civil protection (*COM(98)0768 - *C4-0072\/99-98\/0354(*CNS))
Never will forget like *yo, as young President of my party at the beginning of the years seventy, took part together with father in rally in cinema hall of *Madrid, with scarce public and under some difficult conditions, #where already in #that then under the direction of father gave expression to the ideal and convictions of our philosophy, to values and principles *democristianos and, especially, also, to our #european federalistic conviction.
Is evident, without embargo, that at the side of the indispensable budgetary consolidation, *Europa has to accelerate the structural reforms of the markets of employment, of sakes, of services and of capital, and is in this spirit in the that the Commission finishes to approve the relative recommendation to the great orientations of economic politics.
In front of #all forecasts, the Presidency #german closed the package of Diary 2000, that seemed difficult to close, and now, for the European Council of Colony, the Presidency *nos finishes to announce a quite ambitious program. Congratulate also to the Presidency #german by the ambition of program.
Of this resolution and of the debates that celebrated *permítome stand out #one or two looks that, for me, are the most important: the idea that opened and opens path of a #european constitution, verification or verification wish of power *constituyente specific in the community level and interpretation -*permítome say it like this- *correctiva of article *N of the Treaty.
In place of a clear *reorientación of the #european politics in the *primer year of the euro to a new type of economic development that #can solve the problem of unemployment in mass, *nos gives a European Pact by Employment that remains very by behind it that in day contained the initiative *Santer and the proposals *originarias *provenientes of the Presidency elaborated by the #german Ministry of Inland revenue.
No only for the fruitful cooperation among the institutions but also to ensure of durable mood it that reach in the Conference *Intergubernamental and that application succeed, in the future will be necessary that Parliament take part more acutely that in the past in this Conference -do not employ consciously the expression of Conference *Intergubernamental although it was the usual practice but the of Conference of States members.
It that we want to is to contribute to facilitate things to the Governments, and therefore, with the agreement in day of President *Santer -to the one who want *rendir homage thus-, think that a possibility, a fine possibility, is that the European Commission prepare project, that argue it with Parliament and that take part also the national Parliaments in reflection, that will be a mere reflection, gentleman President.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, the questions related with employment have happened to occupy the position that deserve in politics of the European Union and *Alemania is in actuality pressures to reach a #european agreement in matter of employment with reason of Colony Summit.
Gentleman President, apart from that *me seems quite surprising that *nos see forced to *comportarnos as in fair to have right to take the word in Parliament *cuando are deputies, wanted to say simply that it is the first occasion in the that see that, in an Assembly like #this, *cuando pronounce two contrary opinions, a pertinent of the competent services and the #another of president of Regulation Commission chosen by his equal, considers the of services in question.

In the case of bananas, do not allows to the EU take a commercial granting to small countries that they were colonies (countries *ACP) and in the that bananas represent the *pilar main of economies, it that results particularly grave because politics of the EU inscribes in the spirit of the Agreements of *Lomé, that date of 1963, and are, therefore, very previous to the current Agreement of Trade *Multilateral (Treaty of *Marraquech - 1994).
And finish remembering point already mentioned by Mrs. *Jöns: is incomprehensible that the Council was not had to include of explicit form the *gender *mainstreaming -and is it especially after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam that considers equality of opportunities the fundamental principle of the Union- that constitutes likewise #one of it four *pilares of the #european strategies in matter of employment.
Since to date Government #turkish *deniega this just process and public through evident actions (obstacles for defence, rejection of the requests that they are observant presents, etc.), how measured thinks to take the Council to protect the physical and psychic integrity of the leader *kurdo #as well as the rights, evident for societies civilised, that have #all the accused in front of justice?
*Yo want to *referirme specifically to the structural Bottoms, to Cohesion Bottom and to cohesion politics, saying that I agree in the «how », as it has projected it Commissioner -and even take advantage of once again to say that we have to congratulate to Commissioner and to the *DG *XVI because we have been with *ella, and *ella *nos has helped deeply in advances of cohesion in the *periplo of these five years and *yo believe that, in design, of the next-.

The intermediate posture, to the that also adheres the Presidency, pretends to incorporate development and the operation of the *SIS #as well as the majority of categories object of register to the *tercer *pilar whereas category of visa denial and disposals relative to the protection of the personal data #would be also present in the *primer *pilar.
The big work to know where stop , because this directive has a special characteristic, and is that it do not tries *reglamentarlo #everything, but it that *reglamenta it *reglamenta with sense and with an idea behind, with a conductive idea and guideline, and *yo believe that Parliament #would take badly in changing these balances, #would take badly in trying modify this so delicate situation and that, in my modest opinion, is frankly very achieved.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #some of the colleagues that have talked before that *yo already have remembered article 5 of the Agreement of *Lomé, signed also by *Djibuti, that establishes a true interrelationship, a functional link among respect and the enjoy of the political and civil rights, of the fundamental human freedoms and help to development.
Likewise is necessary that the international community, also through the Organisation for the African Unit, but with an active paper of the European Union, guarantee said agreement and act with regard to elaborate program of economic helps so much urgent as on a long-term basis that they allow an economic reconstruction of the island.
By part, States members began to negotiate on the base of the ancient article 220 of the Treaty *CE an agreement #whose object was to regulate of horizontal mood the effects *intracomunitarios of failure, determining the judicial competition and law applicable to declare insolvency of company.

*Yo believe that only it appreciates it that do not has and the fact that the #european institutions have endowed of Parliament, with #all defects and with #all problems, and that Parliament convert in this term of office in a fundamental piece of the community mechanism, is *algo that the #european citizens #would have to begin to value.
The coincidence in time of the resignation of the Commission, the beginning of war of *Kosovo and the European Council of *Berlín subjected to a dramatic proof performance capacity of the European Union in an extremely critical moment.
#If *Europa had to pursue the goal that signalled President *Prodi -offer to the *Balcanes a political and economic future clear- #would reach *algo great, but #would not exert fully task that is the to contribute substantially to build a path of democratic development, certainly economic, but fundamentally social and cultural, conscious that reconciliation is so much stronger and stable what more is *tolerante and respectful with diversities.
In this case -experience of the *EEB- the Commission is amply innocent, and States members have gone back to take games under the mantle of subsidiariness without having had prowess for, for example, have elaborated of time a directive mark relative to foods that constituted an advantage for *Europa and to the that *atuviesen the countries members.
More that #that *peroratas ideological of period that ask the return of the ancient collusion *supranacional among Parliament and the Commission against the Council, had preferred to listen, of mouth of Mr. *Prodi, the concrete way in that it thinks to repair, in a field of competition, the *estragos caused by the Commissions precedents and negotiations of the Round *Uruguay.
Lady Speaker, as it has said deputy *Sánchez, there are errors in record, but no only because Mr. *Sánchez was included in the Group of the European Radical Alliance, that no exists -case that *le has occurred also to deputies #Bautista, *Hudghton and *MacCormick- but that *yo same, that belong to the Group of the Green\/European Free Alliance, appear in the Group of No Inscribed.
reading of the second inform of the Expert Committee puts of self-evident that had reason in asking to the five experts that continued investigations and reflection further of the case of #one or commissioner, in particular, to take a more general diagnostic on the group of the institution.
In effect, quote the report: "For *incoar a penal procedure to civil servants of the Commission, the national jurisdiction that it treat has to request the suspension of the official immunity treating of suspicious, of the professional secret treating of witnesses and of the inviolability of buildings of the Commission in case of registers and to be able to have access to the documents" .
Why, #if there #be *tanta worry in States members, do not asks to States members that the communities and municipalities make a debate in Parliament, on the results and destinations of bottoms, so that in countries take place a public debate that was in relation with work and that these two questions are not separated among *ellas?
In the meantime, have to negotiate an agreement mark that it constitute a solid base to improve our institutional relations, with measures of transparency and information, as they are the have of work documents of the Council, of records of the meetings of Commissioner School, except *cuando agree confidentiality, or information system on works of the *OLAF with the owed discretion.
*Europa has taken to transmit project, and in globalisation times in the that citizens have the feeling of that #all the important decisions take in part, and especially in the world of finances, is important to recover the idea of project for *Europa that comprise citizens and defend the institutions.
*Yo share fully the content of program, devoted to the *glasnost, that do not proposes a small "*reformilla" of the institutions, but reform of big *calado, that pursues the creation of places of sustainable work by means of a consistent liberalisation, that concedes a very important place to subsidiariness, that considers necessary to answer of suitable way to the demographic evolution in *Europa.
*Me has bumped -have to confess it- that it have been clear regarding freedom of trade and to competitiveness requirements of companies and have omitted -or have shown wander to the *respecto- the fight against unemployment, poverty and the social exclusion, true *flagelos of the European Union.
Gentleman President designated, members of the socialist delegation #french have worry by the effective operation of the institutions, which means instauration of a strong Commission, in the sense of respect by the Treaties, is to say, with the coincidence among mandate and the #ours.
#If we do not want to lose in solidity it that win in extension, #if we want to give a soul to the *Europa of the market and of coin only, #if we want to go back to win confidence of citizens and of villages, have to work in common -Commission, Parliament and Council- in it only that it #can offer a solid base and a new impulse: the #european citizenship, a letter of rights, a true constitution.
And as *me accused of *deslealtad, it only that I want to say in this moment is that, in accordance with these criteria and with demonstrations of President *Prodi in relation with responsibility of Commissioners, believe that, #if today it approves in this Assembly the resolution of political content, *consensuada by #all the Groups, on the new Commission, Mr. *Galeote goes to find in an Assembly of disloyal.
Already discern points of agreement. For example, regarding the importance that concedes to access to justice, to the preparation of a coherent strategy in matter of immigration and asylum, to the protection of the feeblest groups and more exposed to discriminations, or to the strengthening of the mechanisms used in the fight against delinquency organised.
Also remains out of the democratic control the preparation of the document 19 of *Enfopol and also type of offences, #such as the related with performances of the police cooperation *Ilets, collaboration in matter of espionage *Echelon and the bilateral treaties of Security Services of States Joined and the European Union.
While it last this parliamentary gap will be impossible to create a space of security, freedom and justice on a truly democratic base, since the realisation of said space involves the presence of a structure integrated by the right to the individual protection and the possibility to take part in the individual surroundings.
Recognise that it has engaged to fulfil five requests of the Group of the *EVP, among *ellas the that refer to the right of the *PE to present legislative proposals, to behaviour of Commissioners in case that it produce a vote of censorship and to the need to board a permanent dialogue on reform of the Commission.
Subject: Help of the EU for the maritime services of *Irlanda since *Irlanda possesses #one of the greater maritime zones of patrol of the EU, responsibility so important for *Irlanda as for the EU in group and that covers activities like surveillance and interception of loads of drugs, protection of industry *pesquera and security of navigation, #would want the Council expose how initiatives that #would have to take to scale of the EU in help to efforts made by *Irlanda in this sector?
To facilitate fulfillment, in the regulations and managerial of the Union specify collaboration procedures and exchange of information among States members, with the end to avert simultaneous performances and to facilitate identification of ships, achieving so they harmonise moods to proceed of the distinct countries.
*Me seems a frankly problematic solution put that really no treats of fusion of two structures but of adhesion process. And although I consider the possibility to establish transitory periods, as it took before, no conceive that a country candidate #can go in to form part of the European Union without that it have assimilated the *acervo community in whole.
In this frame, the perspective to create a "social order European" based in practice of *Schengen #can not be more that arsenal *antidemocrático that, in a determined moment, #can use against the political and #sindical action, against the reactions of workers in front of politics *antipopular of the European Union and of States members.
Although they have produced #some changes in the political situation from then, regret to say that the requirements for the resumption of cooperation for development and the full normalisation of relations with *Togo - respect of the democratic principles, right state and the human rights - still do not fulfil satisfactorily.
The Commission considers that the European Union, together with the rest of the international community, has to take conclusive measures to contain the repercussions of the crisis in the countries of the region of the Great Lakes that, as they have affirmed deputies, loom of distinct forms security and stability in #all *África.
Want still *recordarles to #all the colleagues that takes only a pair of weeks Parliament, when accepting the Commission, approved a statement in the that underlined that it wishes to progress to work in negotiations on the international treaties and even in the distinct stages of negotiations, so that it #would be really regrettable, #if Parliament left this opportunity without taking advantage of.
am not sure of #if it is allowed to take an explanation of vote in this stage of the debate, but #if it is like this, wanted to say that, from sight point of the population of *Escocia, believe that it is pity that tomorrow debate on the alimentary security without including a case in the that a Been member is the *dictamen of the Community in this matter.
As they know #all *ustedes, *Señorías, sources of renewable energy, in support systems -except energy of hydraulic origin, #where himself\/hisself achieve results very competitive with regard to another type of energetic sources-, #can not compete with energies of traditional type.
Wanted to indicate to Mr. *Prodi that economists believe that the most important factors for competitiveness in industry #would be, in the first place, a reduction of society taxes and of the business contributions and, second, of the enormous and in intolerable truth charge of regulation that plants to *Europa in a situation very *desventajosa in relation with parts of the world.
As a result of the approval of the Common Action, the Commission took part in a series of management of the troika, directed to present the Common Action to #all the Governments and the important regional organisations and collect his political support for goals.
Gentleman President, believe that this debate and the motion that today are put openly of self-evident the will of Parliament to send signal of clear opening, strong and amicable, a signal that takes note of the change of attitude of the #greek Government regarding Government #turkish.
Receive with satisfaction the proposal of relative commitment to *Turquía, because it achieves a correct balance among the need to confirm to *Turquía right to incorporate to the EU and the need that *Turquía undertake a series of reforms economic and political before appeal take 'effective' .
To be able to establish the suitable commitments among the different and complex problems to that confronts at present the system of the international trade, seems fundamental that conversations cover a wide diary that include from the reductions of the traditional tariffs until crucial subjects like the environment and norms of work, in addition to new looks like competition and investment.
By reason expects that the Council, during the Presidency #finnish, get to conclusions for realisation and by the that the Council gives the welcome to the intention of the Commission to present, so prompt as it was possible, a proposal for a new plan of action that boost equality of opportunities among men and women and to ensure that #this will follow applying *cuando remain without vigour the current.
Also explain to these effects with article 13 of the Treaty on the European Union, but *cuando treats of concrete cases have to take into account that the Union do not has own police, but that responsibility on security of citizens *recae in the governments and in strengths of order of country.
According to article 48 of the statutes of #ECB, States members that are not included in the zone of the euro will have to pay a lower percentage of the that *les #would correspond, #if like this it decides it Joint Managerial of #ECB, in concept of participation in operation costs of #ECB.
will Be an enormous quantity, already treat of *Dinamarca or of country, and this maximum fixed, very understood, by means of decision by majority of the Council on the base of a proposal of Government Council, that likewise takes decisions by majority, since country has vote weight, to the that *le authorises contribution.
The question has like this a political solution - do not see possible the bellicose solution- and in this way now have the opportunity to help to *Rusia, that in any case finds in a difficult political situation, loaning help to find a solution and achieve some relative negotiations to the question of *Chechenia.
The #russian army has gone in in the territory of the republic and has invaded, according to his own versions, a third of the territory of #the same *ocasionando deaths, destruction and the massive exodus of more of 100.000 refugees -women, boys and elderly- that are received in neighbour *Ingushetia, #whose President talks already of humanitarian catastrophe and asks an international help that do not finishes to get.
do not know #if, in addition to the results achieved by judicature #italian lately, will have or will not have stages like the that, lamentably, *nos have accustomed to see through the judicial avatars of *Ustica in these years; without embargo, today *nos find in front of sentence that proposes hypothesis of plane contest of varied countries in accident of *Ustica of 27 June 1980.
#Few minutes after the disaster the military planes and the secret services of the countries involved in the military operation - Italians in the first place - set up a gigantic and shameful operation to hide, by not saying, destroy proofs to end to prevent that the judicial authority discovered how was it that *sucedió really in the sky of *Ustica.
Therefore, wanted to direct finally call to the Council so that it fix the common position on directive projects with the greater possible rapidity, with *tanta amplitude as it was possible, of course, on the base of the amendments of Parliament in the first reading, to end to present the common position in *segunda reading to Parliament.
The *derramamiento of fuel owed to that the cover of fuel deposits were not very installed, and the Directive that Parliament has now in front of yes, with the amendments taken by Parliament in *segunda reading with regard to give greater rigour to disposals, occupies of this question demanding that fuel deposits of engine vehicles possess mechanisms of appropriate closing so that the covers was always very adjusted.
On the base of orientation and of knowledge of the that they will be #all parameters examined from sight point *exquisitamente technical, ask, #if it is possible, that Parliament and, in particular, the commission, are informed and especially ask #if it is possible that the Commission *nos inform on #which goes to be the course that will give to the application of this directive from sight point *exquisitamente technical.
#This has to -suits to highlight it-to the following reason: the necessary outlays, particularly in the case of the structural politics, will increase the next year like result of commitments subscribed in previous years and the Commission coincides fully with Parliament in that it is not possible to consign totals inferior to the necessary to cover commitments already subscribed.
*Yo entrust in that, on the base of the previous work made by #all the institutions and especially of the present reports of Parliament, will achieve to reach, through negotiation process adapted and open, an agreement on the Budget 2000 that take justice to our big political responsibility in the field of the #european politics.
In effect politics is not a game among the Commission, the Council and Parliament, that practise in own interest, but that our purpose is to create the best possible conditions for development of the European Union and to offer some favourable conditions to persons for the that work.
In *tercer place, the maintenance of stability of prices serves to the interests of social justice and help to protect to the feeblest members of society, like pensioners and unemployed, that depend of some fixed income and #can not protect of the costs of inflation with sakes, for example properties or actions.
In this context, *yo wanted to *recordarle to Mrs. *Randzio-*Plath that the Treaty expresses of way very clear that the *primer goal of the Central Bank European is stability of prices and that only will be able to try reach the goals *cuando *ello do not put in danger said stability of prices, and also that stability of prices has in himself\/hisself same -#such as it has manifested President- social and economic effects positive
Likewise, my Government promoted the approval of a new Penal Code Soldier that includes substantial advances regarding competition of the civil courts to judge to soldiers in crimes like genocide, the disappearance *forzosa and torture, and sign the Statute of the International Penal Court.
The so proclaimed space of freedom, security and justice is not thing that affirmation of a bureaucratic concept and *represivo of politics in the *cual talks so much of security and little of freedom and of justice, as they show it the dense series of conferences *intergubernamentales, *Dublín, *Europol, *Eurodac, *Eurojust and the mutual assistance in judicial matter that exclude the democratic control of Parliament, #as well as of the Commission and of the Court of Justice.
Against the idea that #ours Union has to be exclusive or mainly of economic character, the Council, in line that Parliament came already defending from took a lot, happened to occupy of citizens, of freedom of circulation, of security and of recognition of the right to justice, rights that have to recognise no only to citizens of the Union, but also to #all those that by diverse circumstances find legally in our territory.
Like this and #everything, wanted to recommend to the Commission - do not know #if it is here gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen but, anyway, already argue it in the general debate - urgency in the case that it had to present rule mark *concerniente to #all the matters, to end to tackle, organic and thoroughly, a so delicate subject from the point of institutional sight.
The special Summit of *Tampere, to time that has centred in immigration politics and asylum, also has treated seriously the subject of the traffic of human beings that no has left of grow during the last years.
In January will have the final proposal on the observatory, on the that *me reserve the right to debate with the European Parliament to see #if it has to have an observatory for small and medium enterprises, that the report on it that goes to *suceder, and that also have felt of connection to national level of the local observatories so that companies are all it prepared that they #can for the future changes.
#This is a principle that has to apply even in the case that helps loan to company no community, in #whose case considers that cooperation agreement with the country of company, there #where no existed, no only #can define and integrate better interventions of the Union in favour of country, but that, in the new desirable contingency, #can facilitate the execution of said sanction.
And think that, really, have things that learn of States Joined of *América in the subject of the monetary stability or in the subject of utilisation of high technologies and of fast operations to level; but of course, exists a big difference in *Europa: the cultural model, social and historical of *Europa is based in the powerful social powers and in the balance among society and the economy.
Gentleman President, in the first place wanted to say, in name of my Group, that are very disappointed by the fact that it have not included in the resolution a call to #all States members of the European Union and to #all the countries candidates so that they support the new proposal of coalition in the agenda that is on the table of the 55ª General Assembly of Nations Joined.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0038\/1999) in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [<lpar>$^13175<num>$/^1<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0022<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1998<num>$/^0197<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes program of community action "Youth" (Speaker: Mrs. *Gröner).
The Group of the Party of the European Socialists, in #all the preparation process of the budget, has defended with energy the ideas of solidarity and of commitment of the Union regarding the most disadvantaged, to end to satisfy eradication goal of poverty.
#If the enormous resources allocated to the nuclear proofs and to the *armamentismo release and pipe to productive investments in the direction of the economic and social cohesion, to education, culture and the protection of the environment, #can reinforce reconciliation factors and peaceful coexistence of villages and contribute to the *reforzamiento of bows of *reprocidad and of cooperation *paritaria.
Like this, as, have to signal the dangers that of *ello give off and here have also now new and unavoidable consequences, in particular the requirements that it have more fishermen #moroccan in the community crafts, fishing licence *restrictivamente related with new mixed companies, the obligation of disembarkment of fish in ports #moroccan, in addition to #granting in the agricultural sphere, etc.
And Commissioner do not finishes to get to the Commission, is Commissioner that proceeds of the previous Commission and precisely with wallet and file, by it that has a specific responsibility and own politics and very concrete no only in the resolution of this problem, but also in the of the problems posed until it concretise again the agreement.
My political Group wishes that it have a just agreement and balanced with Realm of *Marruecos by part of the European Union, but also think that, to avert these periodic marketings that generate enormous anxieties and difficult situations for fishermen, the future agreement #would have to remain consolidated in the frame of the association Agreement.
But #all this discussion evidence the need of an independent organism that occupy of rule alimentary in the EU, that avert the undue influence of the national organs, very often conditioned by a personal interest, and that control the corresponding practices in #all the European Union.
In #Italia the *concertación among the social speakers and the Governments has converted in a pact among the representatives of the #sindical constituted - interests, *patronales, politicians - directed to defend the interests constituted and incomes in place of the possibility to achieve space in the new economy of the unemployed and of #all #that that are not represented in the *concertación.
*Exigirles that work an average of 60 hours to the week during a period of four weeks is exploitation, by part, of these young individuals that have to fulfil with practices to obtain his professional title and, by #another, of #all *nosotros, of the public, that have to consult to youngsters medical in practices in assistance services and of urgency.
In Realm Joined, for example, the proposals are more advanced that this directive and have been received with *beneplácito by #Andrew *Hobart, president of the committee of auxiliary doctors, the one who says that it is loved with that have reached an agreement on a new agreement for the auxiliary doctors that will guarantee in advance a safe labour day in Realm Joined.
By it that refers more fundamentally to the political question formulated on *Chechenia, is evident that share with His *Señorías questions, anxieties, but the question posed is the following: until the present, the European Union has not suspended neither reduced his diplomatic relations with *Rusia, because we think that it always has to have courses of dialogue with *Rusia to transmit our messages, included the relative to restlessness by it that is in *Chechenia.
Still today has the idea that the inner market is multinational subject, of great companies, of *burócratas, of *Bruselas, of *tecnócratas that are far of worries of persons of on foot, of initiatives that *apilan #one on #others without order neither concert, without conductive idea that, in cases, are perceived like #one *pesadumbre more in the already heavy charge to live in a community developed or to have a small or an average business.
And in this sense wanted to highlight that the Commission will have taste in listening every year in the appropriate dates observations and the ideas of the European Parliament *cuando get hour to examine thoroughly and follow developing the concrete goals in the frame of the annual cycle.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0040\/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to information on fuel consumption facilitated to consumer when commercialising vehicles of new tourism (5617\/2\/1999 -*C5-0037\/1999 - 1998\/0272(*COD)) (Commission of Environment, Public and Political Health of Consumers) (Speaker: Mr. *Sterckx)
But then, by coherence, Parliament #would have to reconsider the decision that his majority judged that it had to adopt about Group that had respected the independence of vote of members and the had taken to appear in his internal regulation, it that do not excludes the existence of political affinities in the sense of the quoted article 29.
#If we decide to postpone this subject -as it thought the majority in the Conference of Presidents-, #one of the tasks to make from this time on until December, will be the to request to President of the Court of Accounts that undertake a wide investigation, to know #if leak produced in the Court of Accounts or in #any another institution.
Lady Speaker, the legislative project subjected to debate results very significant from sight point of the environmental protection, since it affects directly to the quality of the breathable air, is to say, to dioxide content of nitrogen and to the resultant ozone, affects all *ello to acidity grade and to level of *entropización.
Gentleman President, in moments in that it celebrates the *décimo anniversary of this Convention, in #whose text recognises to boy like subject singular, and *le attribute own rights (right to life, right to identity and to family, right of expression, right to be fed and polite), know very well that in our continent, each thirty seconds abuses, violates or *descuartiza and indoctrinates to boy, victim of some unsuitable politics, of familiar and economic changes, and victim also of the fact that we do not apply this international Convention.
Regarding the first, to the fundamental rights, in breast of the Union, of compliance with article 6 of the Treaty, are forced to respect the fundamental rights and, specifically, freedoms and the fundamental rights of man, #such as they result of the common constitutional traditions to States members.
On security failures in *Bohunice do not need to debate, only *me allow to stand out the three more important points: follows without having replacement for concrete armed that lacking, no exists reduction of pressure or security systems. modernisation is not sufficient from sight point *sismológico.
*Señorías, in the year 1994 took a series of decisions -precisely to concede helps to distinct #european companies- so as to carry out restructuring of #the same that allowed, on the one hand, his eventual privatisation but, in any case, finished of time with subventions and helps of State that, somehow, distorted the only market and the free competition among the distinct actors in the aerial market liberalised.
The European Commission has indicated by it other to the countries candidates in diverse occasions paper so important that #can exert the social speakers in adhesion process and has remembered to time that have more in account the social problems presupposes that it develop the social dialogue in the countries candidates.
Lady Speaker, to finish, *les will say very in brief that in these four last weeks have had #many meetings profitable: with President of *Colombia, that was received also here in Parliament in session *plenaria, with President of *Letonia, with Subject minister External of *Chipre, to treat to see mood to promote the meetings that go to begin surely on 3 December in New *York.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0062\/1999) of Mr. *Schwaiger, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament - The Approach of the EU on the Round of #Millenium of the *OMC (*COM(1999)331 - *C5-0155\/1999 - 1999\/2149(*COS)).
To my seem, with *él has achieved to transmit three signals: a signal of unit of the European Union, directed to speakers all over the world; a signal of the human face of globalisation, directed to our population; and a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the process of the *OMC, directed to citizens.
lady *Barchawski, special representative of president #Clinton for trade, that has conducted with hit the battles of #Washington on banana, the *OGM and meat of *vacuno #american, has asked to the centres of #american businesses, that *le have provided a document of 31 pages detailing the wishes of industries.
This project has like goals centre attention in violence to woman, strengthen the contrary attitudes to violence, diminish cases of violence, #as well as develop and take more effective services directed to attend so much to the victims, as to the authors of violent acts.
Initiate this new round of conversations with the advantage of wisdom that gives experience and with knowledge that States Joined, when getting to position negotiator, to the equal that in the past, will have investigated the unseen agenda on how establish means to divert of said agreement and help to producers, whereas to time demand to *Europa that fulfil faithfully with commitments.
Gentleman President, believe that the Round of #Millenium is an important occasion to boost the opening of the international markets to competition, to expand the guarantees against practices directed to avert competition and to tackle at last the subject of investments.
Is important that the Report *Schwaiger and Parliament recognise in the World-wide Organisation of Trade the appropriate forum for a serious negotiation in matter of investments looking for certainty and transparency of the right for the protection of investments, #as well as, obviously, the *tutela of the state legislations in social matter, environmental and cultural.
#If *Europa and States Joined argue now on the genetically modified organisms and the use of hormones and antibiotics in industry grazier, the improvement of access to the market of the countries in roads develop and participation in the world-wide economy loom with happen to a second flat.
From 1950 until 1970 the world-wide economic growth was quite parallel to the expansion of the world-wide trade, but from then the economic growth has gone growing only to half of rhythm of the world-wide exports: therefore, at all shows that a greater trade conduct automatically to a greater economic growth.
Is precise that #this establish clearly, to the equal that also has to remain clear that the *codecisión of the European Parliament in the field of the agricultural politics in reality do not covers, rigorously talking, the group of legislation in matter of agricultural politics, but only a small part of the 3.000 legislative acts -some 20 or 30 maybe-, without embargo has to award to the European Parliament power of *codecisión in said fields and also full competitions in relation with the agricultural budget.
program splits of commitment of the *PNUCD to fund activities of development in specific zones of crop of opium, and, as *contrapartida, the Talibans have accessed to not allowing opium crop in new zones, to that the *PNUCD supervise opium crops and to begin to take measures to struggle against the illegal traffic of drugs and to destroy laboratories *clandestinos.
Wanted to express also my more sincere gratitude to Parliament, and in particular to the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, of Justice and of Inner Subjects, #as well as to the speaker, Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, by the quality of work and by speed with the that have recommended the communication of the Commission on the fight against drug in the period 2000 to 2004.
Report (To5-0059\/1999) of Mr. *Pirker, in name of the Commission of Freedoms, of Rights of Citizens, Justice and Inner Subjects, on Regulation proposal (*CE) of the relative Council to the creation of the system "*Eurodac" for comparison of the impressions *dactilares of asylum applicants and foreigners (*COM(1999) 260 - *C5-0082\/1999 - 1999\/0116(*CNS))
is not more that the representative of the industrial and of the financial groups more powerful of the European Union, rival of the *trusts North American or Japanese in the *imposición of onerous sacrifices to the planet, but #all are exclusively concerned for increasing gains, in detriment of workers of his own countries and of villages of the poor countries.
. (*NL) By the present the #dutch delegation of the *PSE declares not being able to support the Report *PIRKER, that has approved today, on regulation proposal of the relative Council to the creation of the system "*Eurodac" for comparison of the impressions *dactilares of asylum applicants and foreigners.
In *Irlanda varied successive governments have manifested to varied governments of Realm Joined restlessness by accident tax in facilities *nucleoeléctricas of Big *Bretaña, particularly accident tax in plant of *Sellafield, situated in the western coast of Realm Joined that it is the less populated, but only to some those that miles of coast oriental, that is the most populated.
Finally, suits to reaffirm that the relative decisions to the process of independence of *Timor Oriental *incumben to village, with respect of sovereignty, by it that the decisions on his present and future have to be adopted in narrow collaboration with the National Council of Resistance *Timorense and no *incumbe to the international organisations *substituir to village of *Timor Oriental, but -*eso yes- *darle #all the necessary support.
By it that refers to the judicial procedures of a sovereign State, the European Commission will follow watching to achieve that Mr. *Nikitin was object of an impartial trial and public based in the principles of the European Agreement for the Protection of the Human Rights and in the Russian Constitution.
The military hit in *Pakistán deserves an unambiguous and cutting conviction. Ask to the leaders that restore right State and the constitutional order and that by means of instauration of a civil government of transition and in accordance with calendar previously established celebrate elections and reestablish the parliamentary legitimacy.
#There is proofs that delinquency organised has found an easy and yielding business with the illegal traffic of human beings, that often are had to pay it that had saved during #all life to end to be able to go in in the rich western countries, with hope to be able to initiate a new life.
And now Mr. Newton *Dunn, with the pretext that Parliament #can not influence so much in the third column as in his juridical base, has posed to change #this, and for *ello has limited reference group corresponding to those affected by security politics of the first column of the European Union.
The special *empecinamiento of the *BEI in questions of public control and transparency *propició that the *ECOFIN manifested it following the 8.10.1999, and quote *textualmente: "taking into account the important financial task that the Treaty and a series of community regulations award to the European Bank of Investments #would owe this keep an exemplary position in the fight against fraud and allow to the *OLAF make the pertinent investigations #if it gave the case.
The speaker #Manuel *Medina has explained of rigorous form and with luxury of juridical arguments how Canarian has come defending from takes centuries, inside the #spanish context, with distinct mechanisms that allowed to those distant islands surpass the negative circumstances to the that before *me have referred, and with wit, the *tesón and effort of men and women resist first and afterwards go constituting little by little in societies reasonably modern and prosperous.
Then fixed a transitory period of ten years so that integration of the #canarian economy in the community world did not go traumatic for #some productive sectors venues and, of *facto, established, #among others looks, a *arbitrio on production and on imports, the *APIM, so as to protect integration of the small basic industries Canarians in the territory *aduanero community.

Enough significantly, the calls of the speaker and colleagues, that have presented amendments directed to *Turquía to end to look for finally the true path and hardly *transitable to a democratic State of Right, coincide with principle objections concerning confirmation of candidate character to *Ankara Why did not plays clean now the European Union?

Subject: Action of the EU against material traffic *ABQ In spite of the grave indications of traffic of appropriate materials for the construction of atomic arms, bacteriological and chemical (*ABQ), do not undertake substantial initiatives to combat the problem, whereas the celebrated debates to the *respecto by the most diverse parts and control agreements of materials *ABQ reveal insufficient.

In the frame of action program on the climatic change, that announced to this Assembly in October, work of the Commission centres at present in the creation of a list of measures *prioritarias in the field of the climatic change that it will be presented to the Environment Council in March.
Now well, objectively talking -#can say from the perspective of the one who observes the battle from a second flat- is true that has progressed in the deliberation about the designation of work groups. But on the other hand, has not reached advance #any in the main field, that is the of the problem of broadcast rights and broadcasts in himself\/hisself.
In the resolution signal steps that #can conduct to take reality the protocol of *Kioto #if *Europa assumed the *lierazgo: reduction of broadcasts in the national field, concrete plans for the reduction of broadcasts in the main sectors, especially in the industrial, in the that broadcasts increase more quickly, adoption of measures of economic character, fast ratification of the protocol of *Kioto and intensification of dialogue among *Japón and the countries in roads of development.
The European Union considers very important that in *Macao apply entirely the Treaty of the UN on the economic rights, social and *educacionales and the Treaty on the civic rights and politicians, #as well as the basic labour norms ratified by the general treaties of the World-wide Organisation of Work.
And it same it is necessary to say also regarding the principle of autonomy and to the current economic systems and social of *Macao, #as well as, in a wider plane, to relations of the European Union with zone of Extreme Orient, since experience encloses *virtualidades that they #can be of extraordinary importance in part of the world.

In the durable signals that fits to underline in transition moment is the absolute singularity of *Macao, the open cultural tolerance among villages and cultures, the religious freedom, strokes of specific #symbiosis and a juridical culture *moldeada with the principles and values of right State and the human rights.
The Council has accepted, equally, introduce a review clause tied to the financial consequences of adhesion of new States members, that will allow to define the repercussions from the point of financial sight of enlargement in the frame of the *codecisión, since Parliament has voice and vote in a strict foot of equality with the Council.

In this sense, *cuando the question includes also look of how takes the European Union regarding the countries candidates to adhesion *cuando in territory *trafica with materials, or conceal practices, it that poses precisely is how political commitment or how political commitments goes to impose to these countries so that they advance adhesion processes.
Wanted to know #if *usted approves this behaviour of the Council that *supedita the approval of the procedure simplified in the frame of the *codecisión to condition that Parliament do not take to cost right to modify the proposal that the Commission presents to the Council, all *ello to conclude that #if we decide to exert our right *nos exclude of the procedure of *codecisión.
Neither #can accept the argument adduced by the Commission that delay in the presentation of proposal has to to that the Court of Justice of the European Communities still has not pronounced on demand presented against the Council regarding the juridical foundation of the Regulation 820\/97.
In Indonesian #ours experience has shown that in diet of the *Orde *Baru (New Order), headed by *Suharto and generals, that occupied my homeland during more of two decades, repression methodology and suppression were applied by means of the *imposición of doctrine, the *Pancasila, that *uniformizaba thought and, in consequence, the human action, in an attempt to destroy the capacity of thinking of individual form, collective and especially free.
Thus, the #christian democrats, that always have defended road of dialogue and reconciliation, want to reiterate #ours more forceful conviction of the acts of violence and attempts against the human rights that follow *perpetrándose and *deplorar delay in development of the peace process.
The European Parliament, always sensitive to the cause of the human rights, #can not remain *impasible in front of it that it is the greater of the violations of these rights: the systematic discriminations and violence that woman is object today in *Afganistán and of the that the public execution of *Zaarmeena is not more that a tragic sample.

Finally and already concluding, Gentleman President, have curiosity for knowing posture of the Commission in front of the amendment 9ª relative to the professional secret of the juridical advisers, #as well as posture that will adopt the Commission in front of distribution sector of cars *cuando expire exemption regulation by category for this sector in the year 2002.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, is *loable, of course, that the Commission, and especially his competent Commissioner, Mr. Go *Miert -that is not among *nosotros, but to the that want to say, anyway, that #can not manifestly *reprocharle that it have lost control of administration- watch by the ideal application of the Treaty to avert distortion of competition in the Only Market.

Unfortunately, *me see forced to *dirigirme to determined sectors of Parliament with a last question. How think to defend the rights of constituents *cuando decide to remove leadership to the fundamental right of request, suppressing the corresponding commission, or *cuando pretend to modify the name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens substituting it by Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Consumers?
request right is a very important conquest in the field of the political rights of citizens and *me seems useful to remember once again, to the equal that the speaker, that this right has found his full recognition in the Treaty of the European Union.
The own *condescendencia of the speaker, when proposing the extension of the term of application of computerisation of traffic diet until 30 June of the year 2003, the system *TRANSIT, is *algo that reflects very negatively assessment of results up to now obtained to #that *respecto.

In order of ideas, sustain the idea of Defender of Village in the sense to suggest that the Treaty *CE mention explicitly roads that they have the particular to present resources, #as well as the possibilities to present claims to Defenders of the national Village.

In the report signals the significance of the continuous training: in accordance with the proposal of the Commission, is precise to loan more attention to the needs of the most greater workers in the frame of training along #all life, that represents to time element of the strategy in matter of employment.
Wail, finally that the *autocensura that has chaired this report -has been by own will, perhaps #can not have taken of form- have carried to the speaker to limit work to questions basically technical and, often, of *relumbrón, without tackling the true questions of bottom, of political nature, that pose to our economies and that it will be necessary to tackle day in front of villages.
abuse of money of citizens of the Union damages the image of the Community, press headlines on the subject weaken support of the population to integration and plant hits of the Union in the last plane.
#This is the suggestion that wanted to that Parliament approved, although to time wanted to encourage the studies that are so that it was a concrete proposal and so that the new financial perspectives and the new budget contain a *PM, a precise reference to this complementary weapon for our common commercial politics.

Under sight point *me cheers that the corresponding commission also have got to the conclusion to refuse the inclusion of a term of reflection, that in my opinion is a *disparate so much juridical like practical, and instead of *ello have introduced a general right of *revocación.
Is true that globalisation of the markets and diffusion of the new technologies of treatment of the communication and of information have unchained economic and social changes that are way in that the markets serve to consumers, to time that changes have transformed the expectations of #this.
To define food like allocated to the special feeding, has to fulfil some specific nutritional needs for categories of persons, that #can not *ingerir common foods, well because have digestive problems or of metabolism well because by state physiological *les results especially beneficial consumption controlled of substances that find in foods.
Equally, the possibility to invite to *reflexionar to the European Parliament before refusing definitively a proposal has left to be necessary given the possibility to begin the political debate among the political groups and the institutions in the first reading.

This suspension in fact of the agreements on the free circulation of citizens *reviste a gravity that, definitely, no *le escapes, nevertheless, prudence in matter of competitions among the Institutions -that #can comprise- no *le exempts to give a political answer: The European Union #can accept that 3.000 citizens are retained with police pretexts with the end of *impedirles exert plenaries right of #european citizens?

And regarding ratification of the Statute of the International Penal Court create, of course, that *ustedes have signalled a point of common sense: what before begin to work this Court, easier will be to tackle and begin to resolve problems like the of the *Balcanes -for quoting the case of more actuality, *Kosovo- and #others that there #be in the world.

gratitude also to #some that do not see #all days, but of the that have a daily reflection: the that elaborate the *Info-Session , the document that informs in brief of the session, and that have virtue that, in an inscrutable jungle as it is the quantity of things that treat in Plenary, know to choose species and tree that corresponds to moment.

Varied subjects of actuality, #such as the #nordic dimension of the Union and relations with *Rusia, will be treated then with security, but wanted to still take out to *relucir actuality question: the expectations to carry to good term the peace process of Orient Next are the best of the last *añostras the rise to power of the government of #Barak.

Along the years Realm Joined has achieved to have a high and effective military capacity and in spite of *ello strengths armed of Realm Joined are now excessively scattered and the greater part of States members of the European Union consecrate to defence proportion of #GDP inferior to the of Realm Joined.
The Humanitarian Office of the European Union (THROW) has taken part from the principle in estimate of the thickness of the necessary help and in coordination of cast of help of the Union to places more needed.
*Yo think that from moment in that it exists the European Union, from moment in that there #be freedom of circulation, from moment in that it exists the agreement of *Schengen and exists unit in the subject of the circulation of persons among the countries members, #can not a *tercer country, States Joined, come to *quebrantar politics and discriminate to a country like #Grecia.
At present the priorities are to put in order the banking system, collaborate closely with #others *pilares and with the *KFOR to provide the basic supplies, accommodation and transport of face to winter, prepare together with the World-wide Bank and #FMI a budget simplified and work in fiscal subjects, #as well as elaborate together with the World-wide Bank a frame for investment to half term that will be presented in the next conference of future donors.
Likewise, believe that these 15 representatives of States members work in administration council in accordance with swearing of charge that *les forces to back and boost, *cuando was possible, the interests of country, and no on the base of a #european swearing of charge that #can demand that they respected to the maximum the ideas and #european interests and no only the national.
The European Union and in particular the European Parliament no have left to express his unconditional support to the attempts to promote the peace process in Orient Half and to provide help to this region.
In the resolution of the month of March of 1999, relative to the peace process and to the future help to Orient Half, the European Parliament has underlined precisely that, although they confirm the agreements of *Wye *Plantation, as like this it has been, the most important problems, especially the statute of refugees, have to resolve .
A last question. Even highlighting the need to follow conceding humanitarian help to *través of the *OOPS, believe that the European Parliament is especially interested in finding a just political solution and objective to the problem of the #palestinian refugees, a solution that was according to the resolution 194 of Nations Joined.
The waves of refugees, in increase, do not solve reinforcing measures *represivas, but exerting an international politics that reduce tensions and contribute to the political solution *pacificadora of any type of difference, and that do not resort, as in the case of *Kosovo, to the criminal measures of a military intervention.
Reinforce exchange activities of informations, of filed, and of preparation of informations, well in the field of the *Europol, well directly among States members, increases the dangers of an uncontrolled use of archives and legalises surveillance activity and of police signing, with the excuse to warn the criminal acts.
Quote: "in so much in will Go prevail the opinion to define to the that think of way like the that have belief and that the right to decide on life and death or to control destination of the country derives of religion, the political climate will remain poisoned and it will be necessary to have that it produce violence by political reasons" .
In consequence, the Union supports the forensic investigations on the presumptive crimes of war and, this same week, the Council of General Subjects has expressed in conclusions his deep worry by the fact that it follow without resolving the question of the varied thousands of missing; in his big majority *albanokosovares.
The Commission receives with satisfaction the positive will of progress that showed the Government in the opposition in the agreement mark, but is necessary to follow advancing substantially - as for example, with the celebration of some just legislative elections, foreseen for the next year - before being able to *plantearnos the possibility to restart a regular cooperation.
At any rate believe that it #would be necessary to follow working to treat to look for the possibility that it had independence among deputy and assistant, since work requires independence, in conversations, in the subjects to treat and even in factors that do not come to the case.
Lady Speaker, of compliance with article 41 of the Regulation, formulated a question for question turn and fulfilled terms that in point 13 of section To of the Annex *II, foresee that "the questions will have to present to President a week before, like minimum, of the beginning of question turn.
After the statements of President *Prodi in front of the European Parliament, the Commission proceeds to an analysis in depth of the situation created by the multiplication of doping cases in sport and considers the possibility to set up concrete measures that it #would be possible to adopt in the community field.
Have suggested to use the commercial television in commercial time and, is more, have asked #if the Commission #would be had to choose the space of time among the general #news and #news sportive, because in case the wide popular coats no #would be zapping.
Gentleman Commissioner, there #be not worse attitude that try close ahead of time investigation of the type of investigation on linen, on the implication of high charges of the #spanish Government in plot of illicit collection of subventions and fraud in helps for transformation of crop.
Finally, wanted to *recordarle once again that the *FEOGA is varied campaigns in these moments and #if verifications at random allow to ascertain irregularities in the management of organisation system of the markets, *España has to have present that will deduce compensation to so much heaved, is to say, that subventions already disbursed will reduce *retroactivamente in a global total that will depend of the gravity of irregularities detected.
Goes to propose the Commission to the European Council more of it same or, by the contrary, the Commission, on the base of the requirement of the criteria of *Copenhague and of the own *convencimiento internal of Turkish, goes to offer to Turkish the possibility of not losing train of the future?
Without embargo, like deputy of #turkish origin support help and economic cooperation and support also to *Turquía in inclusion in the European Union #if well they have to fulfil conditions of *Helsinki. For example, the question of *Chipre, the of the human rights and the question *kurda have to solve politically, abolish death pity and concede a general amnesty to #all prisoners.
Know that the European Parliament follows of wall the evolution of the peace process in Orient Next and that, in breast, exists a deep knowledge of the subjects of the zone, as well it shows the report on the peace process published by Parliament in May of the present year.
Lady Speaker, in name of the radical deputies here present and no inscribed, *le confirm that we do not go to take part in the vote until they do not resolve the problems of the rights and of the prerogatives of #all deputies elect in Parliament and while it do not allow to #all the 626 deputies have rights and duties.
Likewise, are known difficulties that find energies to penetrate the market, #as well as reasons of this situation: sources of traditional energy have a relatively low and stable price; the absence of #tending measures to promote the *FER.
Without embargo, in my opinion, exist risks founded that *Europa, in this field of the international trade and in the Round of #Millenium, adopt positions of *retaguardia and do not assume, instead, as it #would have to, a leadership of civilisation, leadership that wants to direct novelty of the 2000 of the international trades in a field of reliable norms for #all.
Is pity that Mr. *Pasqua have left; said that in this Assembly there #be not debate, but wanted to *remitirle to the results of the economies of Big *Bretaña and States Joined, countries integrated in the system of world-wide trade that have achieved high indexes of growth, the reduction of unemployment taxes and low types of interest.
By #this have to defend also the #european agriculture, tradition of the typical products that *engloban the textile sector, of footwear and of industry, remembering that the elimination of products comports habit modification or even of surroundings: think in oil, the *lúpulo and malt.
Believe that our deliberations of today have turned in fine measure around the key subjects of the environment and agriculture and also to the subject of the social clause, but want to call attention on the specific needs of industry of culture and of the audiovisual sector.
By reason the Council approved on 28 June 1999, in accordance with the procedure of *codecisión with the European Parliament, a common position to take the decision to create an only instrument for finance and planning of programs oriented to the cultural collaboration.
Gentleman President, consider very significant that in the debate on the budget have approved, for now in breast of the commission, amendments that back and ask to the Commission that support the campaigns and actions in favour of the moratorium of the capital executions and, on a long-term basis, the suppression of death pity.
By part, the great world-wide powers -#EE.UU and the *URSS - found near of the diplomatic split and, by #another, assisted to the progressive deterioration of relations among the Atlantic Alliance and #some #islamic countries, in the first place Libyan, whereas in #Italia, in particular the extreme left did not leave to question the #italian participation in NATO.
Therefore, lady Speaker, consider that it is necessary to subject to deputies to a system of internal control rigorous -am the first in saying it-, but do not believe that the text that will govern the application of control have to tread , simply, of the decision type applicable to the group of personnel of the community administrations.
Now well, in this moment are decisions to scale #european that do not appear reflected directly in the Budget of the European Union, but the Budget 2000 follow being, even so, a foundation determinant and that marks guideline for performance in fields of the #european politics during the next year.
Begin to *atisbar the amount of the needs for the *Kosovo, there #be had an earthquake in *Turquía and a political cataclysm in *Timor Oriental, without having the need to endow fishing Agreements with *Marruecos, that the Government of the main country interested had to to forget in negotiation on piano of *Berlín.
To time, *me surprises that *Finlandia, that at present occupies the Presidency, follow so strictly the mistaken opinion of the Council, according to the *cual the world-wide events will not have influence in the evolution of the budgetary process neither in the total amount of the budget of the EU.
In fact, transfer of a basic competition of the modern State, the monetary politics, to a truly #european and independent organisation like #ECB has to consider like a historical event that marks grade without precedents of political and economic integration inside the European Union.
*Déjenme finalise insisting in it that it is the specific posture of the Liberal Group, that demands, happened the transitory period of two years, the publication of the votes, of the diverse positions in the meetings of the Executive Committee and of the models *macroeconómicos, that understand that it #would allow to take forecasts more *convincentes and correct precisely by part of #that that operate in relation with the Central Bank European.
Coincide, likewise, in measures proposed for the increase of transparency and in the need of *clarificar how is it that understands in the Central Bank European by monetary politics, further of price stability -obviously, his main function-, because *ello #would contribute, definitely, to a suitable and balanced *policy *mix that have like goal the promotion of the sustainable development and the durable employment.
But #would not owe *sorprendernos in front of limitations of powers that remain to disposal of the national governments of the zone of the euro put that it never has constituted secret of parents founders of coin only that it that had in mind was the creation of a political union and states joined of *Europa.
Inside the #dutch tradition exist also #some forms structured of implication of the *Nederlandse *Bank in the consensus economy, for example with the existence of a council of the bank, that advises to the bank, in the that take part also the social speakers, #as well as because the *Nederlandse *Bank has seat in the Social Economic Council, that is the *primer organ adviser in the economic and social field.
#If there are not #others that take part, will not work, so that it splits of the answer on it that we have to take now is to be more active in discussion marry by case -in the frame of the groups of friends of #Sierra Lion, for putting an example- trying organise a more coordinated answer for *alejarnos of the immediate demands of the crisis.
The Commission *subscribe the dynamic perspective of consecration of a #european concept of access to justice, like instrument for the exercise of the right of free circulation of persons without obstacles of legal type and official. Also is necessary that this right of free circulation go accompanied now of the necessary legislative measures so that it #can take reality in the shortest space of time.
agreed priorities and political orientations and the Commission will have to present a proposal of *scoreboard, group of evaluation of advances reached and of fulfillment of terms established by the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the action plan of *Viena and the own conclusions of this European Council, pragmatic initiative that *augura fine results and that had obstinacy of Commissioner *António *Vitorino, the one who also therefore it deserves congratulation.
Of mood, insisted in convergence and in common norms in asylum process, in the creation -although it wanders- of a financial instrument for situations of temporary protection of refugees, in the intensification of the judicial cooperation, in recognition of the judicial decisions, etc. The principles are formulated and are as a whole positive.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0034\/1999) of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market concerning the common position (*C5-0026\/99 - 1998\/0191 - (*COD)) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to a community frame for the electronic signature (Speaker: Mr. *Lechner).
The concomitant announcements of the suppression of 7.500 places of work and of the enormous increase of benefits, of the closing of factory *Wolber-*Michelin in *Soissons -described of error of communication by the leaders of company- show until how point cynicism and disdain are the engines of the industrial strategy of multinational.
#""*Le have taken the funeral" , said *pomposamente senator *Jesse #James, known by extremism, not giving account - or maybe giving perfect account - that with the signature of this Treaty had begun to convert in reality hope of not going back to repeat it that States Joined took with the nuclear holocaust of *Hiroshima and *Nagasaki.
Gentleman President, the recent decision of the Senate of States Joined on rejection of the Treaty of Total Prohibition of Nuclear Proofs creates an unpleasant antecedent in effort that take villages of the world by a durable peace and by stability.
Want to say with clarity that the European Union has to modify politics to the *respecto, that has to pronounce clearly by the human rights of village *checheno, for which, the *OSCE, armistice Agreement of 1996 and also the condition of member of *Rusia in the Council of *Europa offer an instrument to the equal that Cooperation Agreement with *Rusia.
treats of two different things: while the community organism is oriented to the harmonised and organic compilation of general statistics, pertinent of the distinct States, with the public and the administrations like main customers that, therefore, provide work, the Observatory has objective more specific, more directed and oriented in function of the market and of the statistical needs of companies and of professionals.
Owe *circunscribirnos, as, to the current editorial of article 191 of the Treaty, the ancient article 138 To, that mentions, of way enough wanders, action of the political parties, quote: "to scale #european", which is very different -anyway, the Council and the Treaty like this wanted it- of the notion of "political party European" *stricto *sensu.
Is also a problem of relation among two countries of a zone of the world that needs peace and tranquility and, therefore, this agreement is strategic no only from sight point of these communities *pesqueras, but also from sight point of the balance, of peace, that only #can reach by means of diverse modalities of cooperation, since it treats of an exemplary case.
It that fishermen need to know, in relation with this concrete point, is not that the Commission go to adopt initiatives, is not that the Commission was available for *ayudarlos, it that fishermen need to know, gentleman Commissioner, is how type of initiatives go to adopt and, especially, #which is value of subvention community that goes to concede for help to fishermen and during how much time is had the Commission to apply it.
Because, as it has said my colleague *Miguélez, the problem of fishermen is not the to be funded in inactivity, is the to be supported by the European Union so that they #can exert his professional mission, that is the to be able to work and with *ello contribute to the national wealth and to the community wealth.
Besides, the community presence contributes to the area elements of a responsible fishing and #can be an important factor of balance in front of the presence of fleets, mainly the Russian, by not talking of helps for programs of scientific investigation that includes this Protocol.
Lady Speaker, wanted to that *nos gave information, *cuando *usted judge it convenient on a possibility that, to be true, believe that it will be a disaster for the political information of the European Parliament, to know, on supposition that leave to publish the bulletin of the Session *Plenaria in #all tongues of the European Union.
Believe that the debate of Friday, without the Commission and without the report of the expert committee, went a positive step because *nosotros have the obligation to generate confidence and give answers to the problems that has persons; do not have to *enzarzarnos always in debates among *nosotros that they #can be very interesting but as long as they indicate group line.
The combination of the complete realisation of the only market with coin only, in a context of structural reforms and of strong international competition, will allow to reduce the risks of "neck of bottle" that #can appear in the case that the budgetary politics and *salariales are not suitable.
Of course, seems indisputable that require global and coherent strategies to promote growth and employment, and *yo *me *congratulo that the own denomination, growth and employment, already dismiss prejudice propagated often by the left, to know, the idea that it is possible *contraponer growth and employment, value of money and price stability and measures in favour of employment.
Without embargo, know cases of national Governments that have comprised that exists an important *interdependencia among the effects of the monetary politics, financial and *salarial, and that, as in the cases of *Austria, the Low Countries, *Irlanda or *Dinamarca, for example, have extracted the owed consequences, with positive effects for work market and for the consolidation of the budgets.
The same that the demand of the Central Bank European in the frame of dialogue, also have to ask transparency and the direct participation of the European Parliament to the Council of Ministers of Finances, to the Councils "jumbo" , to the Council of Ministers of Social Subjects and to the European Council.
Has to satisfy , of time for ever, claim of a labour week of five days, 35 hours, with 7 or 8 hours of work to day without reduction; but with an increase of wage, and the cancellation of the regulations that force to worker of the sea to 12 hours of work to day in normal conditions.
Recognise that Mr. *MacCormick has aimed an important data when referring to the situation of the travelling artists in the #european frame, to artists that work in different countries, as it #can be the case of the *pianistas or the dance companies, when referring to exponents and producers of culture.
Like this and #everything, interpretation of the Regulation #can not be neither of the Table - here quotes a meeting of days 22 and 23 November 1979 - neither of the Table to proposal of President, in accordance with presidents of the political Groups, according to the decision of day 19 November 1992.
Each #one of *nosotros has persons unemployed among voters #Ours obligation #would have been to refuse the regrettable idea of the Commission that the unemployed #would have to receive by means of a greater deregulation of work market and by means of social impulses stimuluses to interest by work or for taking part in politics measures of employment.
Like this, as, is necessary a modification of politics to end to consider *prioritaria the fixation of clear goals and the materialisation of effective structures for the creation of durable employments and with rights and the consequent important reduction of unemployment.
*Cuando affirm that the reduction of the fiscal pressure on the labour cost do not has to engage the *saneamiento of the public finances neither the financial balance of security systems, propose quadrature of the circle that only #can resolve through a strong economic growth.
In effect, although *me cheer of decrease of unemployment to scale #european (9,4% of the active population in 1999 in front of the 10,1% in 1998), the gross reality in figures do not has to in any case mask the difficult economic situation human and social of the most disadvantaged regions of the community territory.
program, as I have said, will be an important instrument in the fight against violence to women, teenagers and boys and will serve to sensitise to society and to the media on the need to help and protect to the victims of violence.
In the previous term of office, presented in name of Parliament a report on the protection of infancy and of family, in the that requested an important budget for boys and that created in the Commission a specific unit, attendant of the protection of infancy and of family.
#If embargo, and lo and behold reason of this oral question, still has not presented a proposal reviewed that it indicate clearly position with regard to the amendments of Parliament, neither neither - and have to say it with weigh, since, instead, *nos expected that the Presidency #finnish took in account this problem - has shown the political will to transact this *dossier.
Regarding the possible legislative measures, in this report asks to the Commission that examine the possibility to modify the valid legislation or introduce new measures that strengthen these goals, but also *le asks that it check and study the effects of #all the legislative measures adopted up to now and report of cost and his total efficiency to Parliament.
The recent nuclear accident had in the *Japón has revealed once again the criminal negligence of the nuclear industry and the recent fake of security verifications by part of *BNFL in *Sellafield are proof more that there #be reason to feel worry by the nuclear industry and operation.
Remains a lot for taking so that the right to energy was a reality in #all places, in the poorest countries as in the countries industrialised, #where #all categories of the population do not have access to energy in equality of conditions: therefore, do not satisfy the needs and the energetic questions purchase crucial importance.
#All have confronted *algún day dramas and the resultant paradoxes of the absence of freedom of circulation of sentences that has reflected in absence of justice for individuals and self-evident absence and omission of compulsory #european instruments and imperative that, to scale of the common space, *suplieran incongruences of the juridical fractionation that the national systems produce of course.
The previous orator, Mrs. *Echerer, already has said that there #be not any "*Containment" neither neither exists a security of sufficient service of plant even in opinion of the competent #slovakian authority for security of the nuclear head offices.
The Commission already has carried out a complete study of eutrophication and the relative problems to the subterranean waters and States members have indicated the relative problems to the subterranean waters and the vulnerable zones.
Takes a week was convinced that #if it negotiated arduously existed hope to reach an agreement that established a just balance among the reasonable protection to companies and to agriculture of the EU, on the one hand, and access to the market for sakes of the countries in development, by #another.
Have supported #all efforts directed to reinforce the position of the countries in development in the system of the world-wide trade, without forgetting take upsetting in the indispensable need to continue with reform of the Common Agricultural Politics of the EU.
Is important in the context of the next round of the structural Bottoms of the EU for 2000-2006 that measures that include in the distinct community programs are analysed with the end to guarantee that they adjust to the national and community legislation in the field of equality of opportunities.
Now well, from moment in that it is foreseen that the amounts reduced or suspended happen to charge of the community budget, as very late in the following exercise, intervention will translate *obligatoriamente in measures more severe in the course of the following years, with a risk of weakening of the principles of the common agricultural politics.
While it do not surpass eagerness of *apropiarse of sakes, of resources of the zone -#this also is true in the case of *Europa and of #many States-, will not cease conflicts in the region, and also #would owe *reflexionar on the need to find a wide solution of general character on a long-term basis.
A last thing: tries to include in negotiations of the Round of #Millenium *demasiados subjects, *demasiadas appeals of type, perhaps to save consciousness, *cuando afterwards -and think in death pity- *Europa in his own headquarters, in the UN, do not achieves to form a common front and have strength to impose #some things.
#Many criticise today to the World-wide Organisation of Trade for having a too much unilateral vision of trade, for considering it like a goal in himself\/hisself same without seeing the complex existent relations among the commercial exchange, the human rights and respect to the environment.
The field of action and the influence of the *OMC will grow of considerable form in the Ministerial Conference of *Seattle; therefore, the EU #would have to commission that the consequences of liberalisation of trade and of performance of the *OMC are continuously reviewed from sight point of equality and of the environment.
Believe that also the Council -that among our institutions is, in mood, the that more has *fragmentado with the multiplication of skilled Councils and committee myriad annexes- has to preach with the example, but no only thinking in the future but also thinking in the need to have a democratic and effective community.
#Everything *ello, and with #this finish, gentleman President, results even more necessary to sight of #that #another big mandate, #whose launching will be gold brooch of the Presidency #finnish -the excellent #finnish Presidency, #whose *muchísimos tarpaulins have once again the honour to recognise in this hemicycle and that has supposed inflection point in the behaviour of the Council.
Subject: Suitability to fund programs of the *PNUCD The *PNUCD (International Program of Nations Joined for Drug Control) has taken publics data of the annual poll on opium production according to the *cuales the total production estimated of opium gross in *Afganistán will have duplicated with grow this year, happening of the 2100 tonnes of 1998 to the 4600 foreseen of 1999.
Wanted to ask to the Council how form proposes to take take part to Parliament, *cuando have traced roads, in the formulation of this new financial instrument, as no fits doubt that it will take fault a new financial instrument, in measure in that it that exists at present in mood #any is adapted for the current situation of the countries and the territories of *Ultramar and results unsuitable for the aspirations of said countries.
In the first place, #can say that the colleague Baron *Crespo, to the one who do not consider accomplice, but, even with #all the political differences, an estimated colleague, has exposed the situation of correct mood, in measure in that *le communicated of word that *nosotros, the Group of the Popular Party European and the European Democrats want to that it proceed to vote on the Report *Napolitano.
On my part, consider - and, repeat, #this is it that *me has guided in reflection, but go to ask to Mr. *Napolitano #if it agrees *conmigo - that the object of the report of Mr. *Napolitano is the application of a text of legislative character, since it treats of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, relative to investigations effected by the *OLAF.
The mandate was and follow being only east, it that it is necessary to decide is only #this: include in Regulation, or was, in our internal legislation, the Agreement *Interinstitucional so that it #can apply in the field of Parliament, on the base of a *dictamen of the Commission of Budgetary Control; modify the Regulation introducing the new article 9 *bis and not modifying the Agreement *Interinstitucional.
Gentleman President, the immense majority of my Group is *resueltamente adherent of this report, that consider like #one of the angular stones for the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union concerning the question of form in that it investigates fraud complaints and occupies of *ellas; probably no costs for nothing more, but perhaps help to show that #many of complaints *carecen often of foundation, although alas it was not always like this.
Ascertain, second, an inability of substantial coordination, and #this means that the Presidency #portuguese has at all costs that assume the initiative that conduct to the creation of a council *interinstitucional that gather at least time to the year to coordinate #all actions in the interior of the Union, so that *coadyuve to the international coordination.
#If in the #european Summit do not understands -because we think that the Summit has to occupy directly of the subject- that treats of the political problem number #one, with enormous consequences for the future; #if it do not understands that the inability to tackle it *multilateralmente, that is as it has to tackle , has begun has to take increasingly patent, with the subsequent disappointment of villages, then will not be able to in a prudential time stabilise the situation.
Is true that, in Parliament, the Court of Accounts do not has good sign, since President *le has denied conference hall of press, *cuando no exist problems for *acordársela to the most incredible associations, to personalities of the most doubtful representativeness or to dog guardian of thought only, with #such that bark strong.
. (*SV) Want to *puntualizar that the establishment of a system to compare the impressions *dactilares do not constitutes in himself\/hisself guarantee to reach a politics of human and generous asylum, that mean that States members *solidariamente award to asylum applicants right to shelter.
By it that refers to the international organisms, have to watch by that repatriation program of the *ACNUR continue activities without that it trip with difficulty gender, since there #be had a series of incidents in the last time that seem to indicate that it exists the deliberate intention to procure *desorganizar repatriation program of the *ACNUR.
But the fight against drug traffic and capital bleaching demands also action\/coordination in level of the EU (and in the of Nations Joined) in the fight that has to carry out against the powerful criminal organisations that, with activities and illicit money, *minan the economic and financial system and *entremezclan with *él.
In adhesion Record of *España and *Portugal to the European Communities -in article 25 and in the Protocol 2 *anejo to said Record- established for Canarians a special diet characterised by that Canarian was not integrated in the Common Agricultural Politics and, besides, by not being subjected to the Union *Aduanera community, to diet *arancelario community, neither to Tax on Value Added.
#There is had besides element: already in the Treaty of *Maastricht of 1992 incorporated a statement recognising the special situation of the regions *ultraperiféricas -Canarian, *Azores, *Madeira and the #french departments of *Ultramar- and section 2 of article 299 of the Treaty *CE, after modification by the Treaty of *Amsterdam of 1997, foresees a special diet for the regions *ultraperiféricas.
Therefore, *me #would seem timely that the Commission approved or manifested agreement with the proposals of Parliament -of the Commission of Juridical Subjects-, that are very reasonable and agree with the philosophy of the Commission but *reforzándola with the reference to the new article 299.2, that goes to foresee and allow development of a special diet.
*Yo do not go to gloss now his political path -*usted finishes it to take very well, lady Speaker-, but yes wanted to leave proof, publicly in front of this Assembly, of his human quality, of his personal value, of dignity, of integrity and of value with that *ella has carried illness until the last moment.
The inform that in said resolution President of the Court orders to postpone the execution of act of the European Parliament of 14 September 1999 by the that Parliament adopted interpretation of article 29 of Regulation, proposal by the Commission of Constitutional Subjects.
#One of the special subjects in questions of employment under the Presidency #finnish has been the position of workers of more age, subject that treated in an unofficial meeting of Council of Social and Labour Subjects; likewise, also celebrated a conference to ministerial level that treated precisely on equality.
As we promised, in *Helsinki celebrated a meeting to ministerial level on the #nordic dimension, and although it was not very high the participation of Subject Ministers External of States members - *yo was the only there -, instead, were present Ministers and also #all Ministers of the countries that belong to the field of the called #nordic dimension.
Second, the report do not drops in cheat to present the human rights like a #european attainment, but that takes it from the universality and handles a world-wide optics, loaning attention to performance of the EU in the frame of Nations Joined.
Check with bitterness that from the year 1996, year in that the crisis of the sea *Egeo induced the European Community to block union Agreement *aduanera with *Turquía, has not given step advance to get to the full respect of the civil rights and to the protection of minorities.
After conversations that have kept in the last days with Prime minister #turkish and of the diverse meetings with Subject Minister External Turkish, #can *comunicarles that Government #turkish is fully conscious of the need of this fundamental change in the political field, economic, social and cultural.
The Presidency #finnish of the Council is a serious effort to take use of the new legislative possibilities planned in the Treaty of *Amsterdam and begin to apply already the proposal after the first reading, time incorporated the amendments of the European Parliament.
material do not reflects tendency to the increase of the index of substances harmful satisfied advances eastwards, but that the high indexes of harmful substances give in zones that accuse the influence of the local activities: agriculture, industry and the houses of *veraneo.
For the European Parliament, #this are facts consummated by the vote of the Council and it only that *nos remains is *explicitar that this measure has caused enormous unrest in the rest of producers of States members, say that the *excepcionalidad of this measure is not foreseen in the regulation, and signal that also States members had climatic conditions *desfavorables in moment and, without embargo, did not have it that now *le is to *Portugal.
In summary, the socialists want to ensure defence of producers, of consumers and of the importing Europeans, and believe that with the report that has approved Fishing Commission, with the excellent work that has made the speaker Mrs. *Fraga, to the that I want to congratulate, and with the agreement to that has got in the Council of ministers #can, in big part, remain satisfied.

To answer to these world-wide challenges, #would owe *forzosamente «reform the model of the *welfare» , «review the rules of work market and of the markets of the professions, to reduce obstacles to access of the market and [<lpar>$^.<sent>$^.<sent>$^.<sent>$^]#\<rpar\> create employment that react more to the economic growth».
#If we join #this to the elections to the European Parliament of 13 June 1999, the European Union has to confirm his firm dedication to the principles of democracy, of solidarity, of justice, of transparency, of stability and of peace.
Is like saying that the Council and the Commission consider that the insular regions of the Union have known an economic development #such that questions the political will, expressed a year and half before by the Conference of *Amsterdam, to take in consideration of effective form the insular fact?

Like this as, is a political answer the that *le ask, gentleman, since I am in front of minister, and wanted to know #if in the Councils of Ministers get *ustedes to talk no only, of course, of immigrants, of problems of security, *algo that takes *usted very well -the #austrian and #german Presidencies reveal it #all days- but also of the right of citizens, together with the right of capitals, to circulate freely.
In the frame of the bilateral conversations, the Federal Government German, in quality of Presidency of the Council, has urged -even very *insistentemente- in diverse occasions to the #ukrainian part so that it modified disposals by humanitarian reasons.

Include in my gratitude to #all civil servants that *nos helped to get to commitment in the that appear three of the main basic aspirations that had in Parliament: have of a juridical instrument of horizontal character; of an only financial instrument, the *IFOP; and reach, besides, that in the regulation base collected, at last, #all the financial structural measures.
For example, the continuity of #tending actions to keep a modern fleet, safe and competitive; or #that that have shown to be instruments very effective of politics *pesquera, like the mixed companies with third countries, to the that the proposal of the empty Commission of content, *cuando #can be an excellent formula of cooperation with third countries, as surely it will show in the future in the case of *Marruecos.

Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, like Speaker of the Commission of Public Freedoms and Inner Subjects, *me satisfies, of course, to the equal that to #all the colleagues that have taken part, that have achieved an agreement and that the Presidency *nos have been able to communicate that the Agreement of *Schengen has integrated, in effect, in the Treaty of the Union.
The *segunda area in the that agree with *ella is that, in the question of the «*opting-*in» or «*opting-*out», choose it that wants to receive or refuse it that do not wants to receive, have to give to consumer the right to take #this last, but the fact to prescribe how #can or #can not put in network supposes to restrict of mood the expansion of traffic that #would produce a negative effect in the own only market.
Odd political is #this, that *nosotros ask to the Council tendency that, apparently, *nosotros do not want to respect going against of the Treaties, against of our own Regulation, against of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and against of the same common sense, that says that, *jurídicamente, act is act and has value of this formal act.
Regarding Cohesion Bottom, #this occupies place aside, since finance logic is the of finance by project and no by program; in spite of occupying place aside, exerts paper determinant in the sense to help to the economic and social cohesion, that is #one of the committed of the European Union.
Since we wish austerity in #everything it relative to the budget of the EU, #as well as a budgetary program marked by rigour and priorities very founded, *nos showed contrary to the increases proposed in the budget of the EU for the next exercises and have voted in favour to return the proposal to the commission.
person like #Simon *Peres, for example, and collaborators of the Party *Laborista, represent an unambiguous politics to the *respecto. In front of this situation, #can not but express hope that also the #israeli part declare categorically that wishes to engage in depth with peace and that will put end to the numerous measures *represivas that, unfortunately, have come *sucediendo from taking of power of *Netanyahu and nomination like Prime minister.
Gentleman President, the Palestinians have adopted a very brave decision and expect that Government #israeli - so much the current Government like the future - show determination. Need a #palestinian State sovereign, need that it respect fully sovereignty of the *Líbano and of Syrian and, obviously, also need guarantees regarding sovereignty and security of #Israel.
The arrest, out of borders of *Djibuti, of #some leaders of the opposition -specifically in *Etiopía and in the *Yemen-, extradition to *Djibuti and imprisonment, conditions in the *cuales find arrested persons, the absence of trial, the absence of lawyers, the particularly difficult and painful conditions of arrest: *nosotros know all *eso and is evident that #can not admit it.
Now well, the resolution that present fixed the goal to obtain ratification of at least 60 countries until the end of the year 2000 so that in year the International Penal Court #can go in in functions and asks to the Council that inscribe this goal in the agenda of the European Council of Colony.
By part, takes a call to the sense of responsibility of those who employ freedom. But on the other hand, corresponds to the public organs find suitable solutions to put *coto to the bad use of these hurtful freedoms for society in general and especially for taxes and tax collection.

of the report of the European Council and of the statement of the Commission on the meeting of the European Council celebrated in Colony days 3 and 4 June, -the statement of the Council on activity semester of the Presidency #german.
To difference of it that occurred in 1991\/92, in occasion the EU adopted a common position in the *Balcanes and took it because the #european States finally comprised that it that there was in game was not only a moral commitment or the future of a peripheral #european region, but his own security, security of #all *nosotros.
The question of taxpayers #net or the new regulation of the financial frame has been *esgrimida to the principle by the Federal Chancellor German especially in front of the #german public opinion but afterwards has *fracasado *miserablemente to hour to solve the problem.
To #that *respecto, *me #would enjoy to ask to Mr. *Fischer #if it sees, further of Colony conclusions, a perspective to short or to half term so that they adhere the countries that still have not taken it to article 5 of the Treaty of *Bruselas modified, is to say, to the clause of mutual assistance that links to the countries at present members of the Western European Union.
The second motivate is, it that has shown again clearly war of *Kosovo, and perhaps exert here also paper the different political experiences, very especially in the *Europa central, that only exists an only security in this continent: #can not allow in this continent nationalism, racism or a primitive form in gross of fascism.
Likewise have ratified the conjoint resolution of the Council of General Subjects and of State Bosses on the location of reconstruction Department and have decided to summon a summit for the stabilisation agreement of the *Sudeste of *Europa in *Sarajevo.

And want to finish, gentleman President, with a question directed to Speaker in exercise of the Council of External Ministers: #if *Turquía do not offers guarantees on life of *Öcalan, #if *Turquía do not gives #some steps in the direction of recognition of the political rights of the *kurdos, considers the Presidency #finnish that we have to advance in *Helsinki to the statute of country in process of adhesion?
Related with #this, the Council asked to the Commission that checked that the execution and operation of alarm systems of the EU are *homogéneos and effective, and in case to be necessary, presented propositions for *mejorarlos, and to time considered form to expand the systems of current control to fill up the possible lagoons.
In relation to infringement procedure #can *comunicarles that the Commission has initiated a fast procedure on *Bélgica on the base of the *art. 226 *TCE because the #belgian State did not fulfil with obligation to inform immediately to the Commission and to States members on intoxications by dioxin neither acted entirely according to the Resolution 1999\/389.
do not want to get to extreme to affirm that in the last five years have produced #one *renacionalización, but with security, the Council, for example, to hour to confront the consequences the crisis of the *EEB has not shown a greater prowess to mark true #european goals that they were susceptible of control and also of sanction.
Second, wanted to *indicarles that the annex 3 contains the composition of the tables of the delegations, by it that ask #if yesterday, *cuando vote point -which took-, #if yesterday, as, were available also the lists with the names and with the composition, or #if yesterday we have voted without knowing the composition, which *me #would seem *inaudito, to the not existing the corresponding documentation.
Later will integrate to the Regulation; but #if tomorrow, before the approval of Record, a political group, or well 32 deputies like minimum, of compliance with section 4 of article 180 of the Regulation, impugn this interpretation, the question will subject then immediately to our Assembly, that will pronounce, as it is established, by simple majority, in presence of the third part of members like minimum.
Therefore the priority of my Group is *eliminarlos and subject to the Commission to the common right, before that look for other solutions, like the to create the figure of the #european public prosecutor, that #would satisfy manias federalistic, but #would not contribute much more with regard to powers of the *OLAF in the fight against fraud.
No *me force to remember here names, but do not have to watch very far to see in these same seats to #who now applauds the proposal to create a *fiscalía #european, but that did not have *empacho in voting against of *ella *cuando takes a pair of years the proposed Mrs. *Theato and *yo same, anticipating certainly that #this #would require to advance in the creation of a judicial space European and modify the Treaties.
Twisting arm to politicians of the European Parliament, leaving the path *expedito to the ideas on common defence, common taxes, a common politics of social provision, on the that on recommends reduction, leaving in end the path *expedito to politics, in spite of it that think to the *respecto the #european population.
Yesterday went back to remember it in moment to proceed to the approval of Record of Friday of the session *plenaria previous and Record signals now, on the one hand, that required the content of my intervention, without collecting how said really, and by the #another side, to continuation adds relation of #all members of the tables of said mixed parliamentary commissions.
The only instrument to enhance responsibility to progress in control of resources #as well as the improvement of the Administration is a delegation to be able to and responsibility more restricted. To time #can improve essentially a problem so *palpitante like the slow circulation of payments of the European Union.
Are in game the possibility and the need to issue a signal, to leave clear that *nos take very seriously the subject of security and of justice, to underline that in the Summit of *Tampere treats to collect information in benefit of security and freedom of the #european citizens.
Lady Speaker, candidate to Commissioner *Vitorino signalled in question round that the goal of the preparation of a regulation of human rights #would not be only to find a common denominator among States members but that the regulation #would be an independent statement of rights.
Create, to finish, lady Speaker, that the goals of the European Council of *Tampere are very ambitious, but think that only being ambitious in obstinacy for taking reality this space of freedom, of security and of justice will achieve that citizens of the European Union see in works an effective instrument to face up to problems.
. Have given my positive vote to the Commission chaired by Mr. *Prodi, in the first place, because President answers fully to the profile that sue the challenges to the that it has to face up the European Union when crossing the threshold of the *tercer #millenium, and because, in general, Commissioners have given proofs of capacity to answer to said challenges of effective way.
Gentleman President, this *burden *of *the *future of the that *usted talked takes years in Budget Commission already is ballast of the present, because I believe that we have taken case *omiso to warning" and have not been it sufficiently strong like Parliament not to yield to saving deceptive by part of the Council, that presents payment budget forgetting warily that commitments have to fulfil .
Without embargo, also the Commission #would go out winning #if the proposals went adapted in the sense that suggests Parliament, so much in it that to the financial responsibility as to the structure of the Agency for reconstruction refers, since no suffices with assigning resources. Is #this the only form to guarantee an effective procedure, transparent and justifiable.
Satisfies to group that the Council have collected with diligence, as it already said it Mr. *Wynn, the idea of Budget Commission and that it have studied cost fault of bottom of agricultural guarantee.
Is necessary that the Council and the Commission *prorroguen the suspension of support to the economic and military cooperation, because Indonesian, gentleman President, did not attends to the argument of the human rights, only attends to the argument of the economic sanctions and of the military interests.
#If strategy consists in discrediting to the Government of *España with falsities and, besides, in showing a *sectarismo *falsario, irrational and irresponsible, shows a self-evident inability to comprise #which is mission in Parliament -that is not precisely the to use the tragic death of boy-, and then is really worrisome that career begin of way.
In view of that the Treaty of *Amsterdam concedes the maximum priority to the protection of the human health and in sight also that the European Parliament has now powers of *codecisión with arrangement to the Treaty, #can the Council ensure to Parliament that proposal related with contact lenses of multiple use in experimental stage will happen by Parliament so that the see and #can *aprobarla?
Subject: Situation in *Kosovo *Algo more of two months after installation of the *KFOR in *Kosovo, no only has not achieved to appease the situation in the region, neither contributed to consolidate a climate of stability, security and peaceful coexistence of the distinct communities, but that, by the contrary, has exacerbated and gone back even more taut the unstable situation originated by bombardments of NATO.
Share the objections concerning the election of the headquarters of the agency in question - in our opinion, *Pristina and no *Salónica.-, #as well as the objections about the apparent unilateral possibility - therefore, in opinion of the Council - to expand activities of said Agency to other regions of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia without before at least consult to Parliament.
To the equal that in the case of #all the current community agencies, the Commission proposes that States members are represented in the administration council, so that presence guarantee the full coordination of activities of the European Union with #that developed on terrain by States members.
The pending problems follow being #many: the 70% of the territory of *Cisjordania and *Gaza is occupied militarily; the statute of *Jerusalén without defining; the #israeli settlements and expropriation of earth and of water; the more of 2.200 political prisoners in prison; the question of the #palestinian refugees of the *primer exodus of 1948 and of 1967 that rise to some 4 millions.
In the *primer and second script of section 4, Parliament asks that number of representatives in enclosure" commissioned to draft the Letter was equal to number of the representatives of States members, is to say, fifteen like minimum; simultaneously, removes of in half to the national Parliaments, suggesting that it only proceed to "query of presidents" .
Expect that the graphic demonstrations and even thrilling that have witnessed this afternoon in the Assembly and the so human gestures that have shown so much Greeks like Turkish in the last weeks, conduct to the strengthening of relations among both neighbouring countries, #as well as among *Turquía and the European Union.
Also #would have to examine seriously enlargement of the mandate of the *OSCE from a point of financial and personal sight. Ask to Mr. *Kinnock that commission to Mr. *Patten that *nos inform in the Commission of External Subjects on the results of analysis so that we #can adopt other resolutions.
The first -besides say it like historian of medicine- refers to the fact that, in a continent that has been destroyed by colonisation, as it is *África, is not chance that have arisen the epidemic of AIDS but that it is the consequence of impoverishment of this continent and, thus, are responsible, as ancient colonising metropoles, to help to *África.
#If well it is evident that the available technical potential for production of aeolian energy and solar, from biomass, hydroelectric and geothermal #would allow to cover quite more of the 12 % of energy consumption until the year 2010, without embargo increase taxes registered in the past *nos indicate that they will require great efforts to reach only this 12 %.
In the first place, regarding the proposal that today debate to fix in the 1,5% to the year the improvement of the energetic intensity of the final consumption - amendment to the considering 15 and to article 1 - consider said goal undoubtedly ambitious, but little realistic, #as well as hurtful for users that already have achieved with hit, but no without great efforts, the clear-cut goals in program *SAVE *I (1991-1995).
time approved, program will convert in an important component of program mark *plurianual of energy, contributing a greater grade of transparency and a better coordination of programs in the sector of energy, allowing that Parliament #can exert supervision competitions in interest of the #european citizens.
And no only is support that are of bilateral way #some countries -as it also is a bilateral collaboration with countries of the *Europa central and oriental- but that also has to take into account support that receive to *través of program *SAVE and of programs community, #where it that takes is to hire with companies -that are the that give support type, of education, of education, of diffusion of technicians of good use- and, obviously, among *ellas there are companies of the European Union.
But certainly no *me will join to demonstrations of *autosatisfacción of the #european institutions, that have even pedantry to pretend that they have contributed of significant way to the disappearance of diet of apartheid in *Sudáfrica, *cuando responsibility of the great powers, included Europeans, is overwhelming in the maintenance of an infamous diet during so much time.
Precisely now, in the meeting of the Commission that finishes to celebrate , gentleman Commissioner *Bolkenstein *me has *resumido of mood that consider absolutely correct and require reason by the *cual there are #some chapters of the fiscal politics that do not require harmonisation and that live in diversity as, for example, taxes on income of persons.
But will see *ustedes in the new organisation chart of my general direction that there #be service to citizen that, truly, pretends to be to service of citizen and that tries to answer to #all the questions of citizens using, as it has asked lady *Cederschiöld, the new technologies, but also using support paper *cuando do not have of means.
Like this, as, is important to understand difference that exists in this moment among problems caused by appeals that #can not attend by budgetary considerations and the processing of commitments, in the that, in spite of difficulties had to beginnings of this year, the situation has improved, and costs pity remember that #some of the problems had to beginnings of this year had little that see with delay in commitment reception in December.
Is really incredible that performance repeat and that every time that there #be a question of deputy, especially socialist, the Popular Party use question turn to cover the shames of Government and that do not take question to the corresponding Commissioner.
The debates of today take place in moment in that relations among the European Union and *Turquía have the opportunity to leave in a new direction: precisely two months before the meeting of the European Council in *Helsinki, of the that expect important decisions related with the enlargement process in whole and especially also in relation with *Turquía.
Lady Speaker, exists a quite grave problem: resolution proposal prays in section 15 of the #italian text it following: "Invites to the religious authorities to that they cooperate fully in the application of prevention programs and to that they take part *constructivamente in prevention action of AIDS" .
Believe that so much the EU like the Governments of States members have to follow toughening control on the general operation of the field of the genetic investigation and, in particular, program application that do not adjust of the all to the guidelines established regarding the ethical, the environment and consumers.
Gentleman President, am very satisfied that the European Parliament occupy acutely of *Macedonia, as we have to have clear that *Macedonia is the #european country that at present sees subjected to a greater danger by unsteadiness of neighbours, but on the other hand has made enormous progresses in the peaceful reduction of the problems of minorities and of tensions with neighbours.
Pretend *convencerlos through negotiation that the half more effective to attract to countries external direct investments, road of privileged access to technology and to the international markets, is first of all creating a safe and predictable frame for the foreign investors, already are *originarios of countries industrialised or of other emergent countries.
In the European Council stood out that development of the capacity of *Europa to control the crisis #would improve the possibilities to take part to international level in the promotion of peace and security, following the criteria of the Fundamental Letter of the UN.
In the last legislative period have asked to the Council that occupy of consistent mood of security of employees and of the population of *Bruselas and do not want *desaprovechar occasion to ask to the Council that adopt security initiative for *Bruselas and against of criminality in cities.
As it already has *sucedido in the past *cuando Parliament, the Council, varied bosses of state and the world-wide public opinion *movilizaron to obtain a suspension of the execution, have to take once again all it that we #can to save life of this victim of the racial hate and of a clear perversion of justice.
*Nos likes that the Government of *Bielorrusia and the opposition are for boarding a constructive dialogue to end to suit in acceptable conditions for celebration of elections just and free, restoring of way right State in the country.
Gentleman President, after almost twenty years and in spite of efforts of judicature #italian and of association of families of the victims, do not know still the truth on the tragedy of *Ustica, a tragedy that affected to the #italian public opinion, #as well as to #all the #european public opinion.
Finally, *permítanme that propose two corrections: in the first place, amendment 6, in the that ask that it do not go back to put in operation head office while it have not carried out investigation, leaves very seated that are of conversion plant and no of plant of *reelaboración of *Tokaimura, that is a different plant situated in a *emplazamiento distinct of the that occupies a distinct company ...
Lady Speaker, colleagues of Fishing Commission have warmed up always the wish that the relative questions to fishing did not go argued only in Fridays and have heard that in the afternoon of Thursday there #be still sufficient time to argue a subject.
The communications and the commercial transactions world-wide electronics in the sphere of services of technology of information are products #whose importance increases without ceasing, and services in the sphere of technology of information will increase in more of the 100% in the European Union of here to the year 2001.
Although the budgetary lines that they are responsibility of the Environment Commission, Public and Political Health of Consumers are not great in monetary terms, exert an important paper in facilitating development of politics of the Union and, especially, in *acercar more to the Union and satisfy the needs and wishes of citizens of on foot.
Now well, in percentage of the gross inner product of the Union, the volume of budget project of the Council is inferior to the of the preliminary draft of the Commission, that already was inferior to the agreement of *Berlín, the *cual was to time inferior to the ceiling fixed by the agreements of *Edimburgo.
Accept totally the need to perfect and introduce efficiency in east management and plans and to improve performance, but a more effective way to take it regarding modification of the budget #would be to describe the improvements and contribute execution plan for the future.
From sight point of method, *me ask why Parliament, when debating the report of the Central Bank of 1998, feels the need to include the approval of a specific measure of the *cual the Central Bank European will give account in the next report, is to say, the of 1999.
The fact that it was imminent a new review to the heaves of the types, as yesterday they gave to understand so much economist boss of the Central Bank, Mr. *Issing, like vice-president Mr. *Noyer, did not shows perhaps that the decision of the month of April was mistaken, had account that meanwhile we have not assisted to any unforeseen impact?
Said #this, owe *alzarme against the true statement of war against workers and the unemployed of the European Union that constitutes the goal affirmed by vice-president of #ECB *cuando talks to "reduce the rigidities of the market of work" , or also "*emprenderla with habits rooted and rights purportedly purchased" .
In the first place, no are neither expect change related with distribution, as in the case of the *ONG and Nation organisations Joined and organisations, carried out by management or politics. Answer to calls and to the crisis and resort to any organisation that #can make a good work in the specific circumstances.
Regarding part of the question *concerniente to paper of members of parliament in it that take -and is form to see the question-, want to say that in my opinion are decisive the own debate, the own dialogue among the Commission and Parliament around politics that have to carry out, and is of there of where take out the decisive inspiration.
is not a lot it that asks my country: only that member of the world-wide community fulfil with part of the task, in development of the principle of responsibility shared. And that #all #can assume the costs of the durable solutions in measure of the possibilities and of the available resources.
has stepped in relation with the *cuarta freedom of the Treaty of Blunt. access to justice further of the national borders, thanks to the mutual recognition of sentences, and the possibility to combat delinquency organised and money bleaching above the national borders.
In the field of access to justice, need that the mutual recognition go accompanied of some minimum common norms and #would have been well that had taken decisions on the rights of persons to obtain freedom under bail *cuando are accused in State that is not the own.
This same year, the European Council of Colony decided to draft chapter on the fundamental rights that gather in an integral document #all the applicable fundamental rights to level of the European Union with the end of *hacerlos more visible to the eyes of citizens.
Is to say, goes to make the definition of punishable acts, harmonisation of the penal right material, the reciprocal recognition of sentences, goes to create *EUROJUST and a protection for victims of offences, is to say, a fan of measures that mean that it is hit.
Even observes a weakness of the Union in the outline of a strategy to end to combat the social causes of migration and to provide help to the countries of origin with seen to reduce pressure to the European Union.
In the last seconds of this debate *me matters to highlight the judicial construction, the fact that citizen, in addition to security, in addition to the police, in addition to the fight against crime, wants to know that justice is #his, that is justice, in point of *Europa; that, in front of judge, will have justice.
Finally, Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects of the European Parliament has withdrawn the corresponding part of the resolution project not to have problems with Mr. *Duisenberg and the European Parliament finishes to back this *dejación.
In front of the current tendency to *desreglamentarlo #everything, the European Union #can, #if it wants to, endow of instruments that allow to promote politics like this, from the *imposición of taxation by the speculative operations until the application of a selective credit that incite to the creation of places of work and deter to companies to take the suppressions in mass of places of work.
For my Group, Union by *Europa of Nations, the frame inside the *cual poses the question is quite delicate, because it exists a danger that consists, on the one hand, in configuring suppositions of an imperfect competition and, by #another, in limiting action of States members in this matter, against of subsidiariness principle.
In a period of situations and *coyunturas critical in the international system, the negative option of the, only *superpotencia real poses a fundamental question. The of the reaffirmation of the political will of the world civilised to control with effectiveness production and expansion of arms that cause massive disasters.
general of four stars Reads *Butler, responsible of the strategic strengths Americans endowed of nuclear armament and that has had finger on the #red button during years, is totally convinced that the mere existence of nuclear armament, that #can use in compliance with a political decision but also like result of a technical failure, is very grave.
Gentleman President, wail *verme forced to abandon the session with Mrs. Speaker of Parliament, and thus I want now signal, as it already said Commissioner, Mr. *Patten, in intervention, that the Union did not accepts terrorism, but neither accept, in any case, the use exaggerated of strength, that #can not be tolerated in circumstance.
#If besides I see it that says in the conjoint statement of the summit on *Chechenia, the most important subject by moment in cooperation with *Rusia: there says that the European Union and the Russian Federation exchange positions on the situation in the north of the *Cáucaso.
The #ours is not only a necessary homage to culture, but also a sober political trial that is born first of all of the *convencimiento to have like speaker to State - in this case *Turquía - that is far still of the full recognition of the human rights and of the principles of freedom and democracy in the *cuales assent the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, fishing agreement with Realm of *Marruecos is with a lot the most important of the that has celebrated the European Union, because of the number of community fuselages affected, to fishing possibilities that opens, to employments that depend directly of the sector -more of 8.000 fishermen and of 20.000 workers-.
Parliament, this same morning, has fulfilled with his have to when including in the budget of the year 2000 game of 125 millions of euros, that had not been foreseen in the financial perspectives negotiated in *Berlín, in virtue of the Agreement *Interinstitucional among the Council and Parliament, but that it is fundamental so that it #can begin negotiation.
did not throw hand of resources that have seen takes little, like the of the liberal democrat that drags meat sack #british by airport with hope that *algún *infortunado official *aduanero the arrest and, like this, #can take photo timely, or the of the conservative that assaulted the *Bastilla two weeks ago in #París, also to take photo timely.
Mr. *Graefe *zu *Baringdorf, colleague of my Group, #one or two times in intervention referred to meat "#english" , but already knows that in Realm Joined there are four distinct countries, and in *Escocia, that is the #mine, agriculturalists have #all the right to feel abused, because, in the first place, do not have a serious problem of *EEB.
From sight point juridical, remains of self-evident that the #french law of 1 July 1998, that creates the Agency of Security Sanitary Alimentary, *sobrentiende that *Francia has of a sovereign power for *salvaguardar health of inhabitants.
#Can have problems to the principle, but the imperative of #all the that take part in the formulation of legislation relative to this agency will be the to watch by that competitions of each #one of the diverse institutions -already correspond to the community level or to the of States members- have suitable reciprocal effects and part know exactly where begins and finishes competition.
That *usted declare now -Mr. *Böge already has posed this question- that will not be able to impose until the year 2003 the compulsory labeling and identification of the origin of animal from moment of birth is, to my seem, #one of the causes of gangrene that supposes #all this crisis of the *EEB.
Parliament has in front of himself\/hisself relative proposals to labeling, as it says His *Señoría, with arrangement to article 152, relative to the procedure of *codecisión, and His *Señoría is in it true when saying that disposals on labeling establish the obligation to facilitate information on animal from the birth, by it that disposals on a thorough labeling are a valuable instrument.
From sight point of States members by separate, the risk do not finds in inflation, but in the disproportionate increases of the nominal wages, increases that *ocasionarían a drastic descent of competitiveness and profitability of companies and, in consequence, a loss of places of work.
#All actors agreed in the need to keep price stability and negotiate agreements *salariales compatible with the goal to continue with the process of *saneamiento budgetary -in accordance with the stability programs of country- and to complete the structural reforms in accordance with the processes of *Luxemburgo and *Cardiff.
The Commission published a White Book in 1997 to end to finish with these irresponsible exceptions; in 1998, presented a communication in the that appeared, among things, directive proposal to modify directive relative to ordination of work time.
Is plan *quinquenal directed to reduce deaths in road and traffic quantity in roads and to watch by that the quality of vehicles in roads correspond to the highest levels possible to protect the environment.
It that we have to guarantee is that it #can give to patients the ideal level of attention of health and of protection of health in the sanitary service and also that the auxiliary doctors receive the highest level of possible training with ideal norms for conditions and labour day -it that will mean a reduction of hours that work- and also the #others obligations that have to fulfil simply to loan services.
And for *eso need a clear juridical order, a juridical order of the inner market, with principles, that *irradie to #all the #others political and through the *cuales citizens have a clear idea of it that has been taking from 50 years ago and that now, through these initiatives, believe that will have future vocation absolutely ensured.
Also wanted to mention our feeling -like the of *usted- that the common citizens and currents have to see an increase in rapidity and efficiency of infringement procedures against States members in the that the rights of citizens of the European Union exerted inside the Inner Market result violated or *denegados.
To5-0045\/1999 of Mr. *Menrad, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on decision proposal of the Council [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0440<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0173<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1999<num>$/^0192<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> by the that creates the Employment Committee and on the proposal of the Commission "Lines guidelines for employment politics of States members in the year 2000" [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0441<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0147<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1999<num>$/^0816<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>;
Happen to it essential and *démonos explains that it is not possible to have employment politics better #if, happened the stage of economic convergence and monetary, do not want to establish the full social convergence and fiscal, with some common norms for #all the countries of the Union.
Thanks to the constructive proposals for employment politics of States members in the year 2000, proposals based in a hit analysis of the conjoint report on employment, the report of Mr. *Menrad traces the path to follow so that *Europa take advantage of of optimum form his extraordinary human capital.
The analysis show that States members have tackled initiatives very significant, that #this take with more seriousness and give more importance that in the past to qualification and to the continuous training of workers and that by means of employment politics have created also new places of work and, in concrete, gentleman *Brie, also want *decirle #this, in the sector services.
The European Commission has reason *cuando criticises in report progress fault in matter of employment for these less favoured communities of States members and takes a call in favour that it put a greater emphasis in the principle of "*mainstreaming" in employment programs regarding measures to struggle against discrimination.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0041\/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that modifies the Directive 93\/104\/*CE relative to determined looks of ordination of work time to include the sectors and activities excluded of said managerial (8642\/1\/1999 - *C5-0036\/1999 - 1998\/0318(*COD) (Commission of Employment and Social Subjects) (Speaker: Mrs. *Smet)
Precisely because I agree, believe that Parliament #would have to take advantage of occasion to indicate to the Court of Accounts his big restlessness in front of the fact that a document of substance of the that has prepared the Court have filtered, in correct or wrong terms of content, to newspaper *Der *Spiegel of 8 November.
*Me refer to the fact that in the common position takes reference to health in looks physical, psychic and social, to quality of life, to violence in what rape of the human rights and, in particular, to the fact that program includes also to victims of abuse and sexual exploitation.
program has like solid base recognition of the need to sustain the human rights and the of boy, according to the Convention of the Rights of Boy *promulgada by Nations Joined in 1989, as also the of women, #such as they expressed in the Statement of *Beijing and in Action Platform of 1995.
Consider that the sum of this initiative with the open perspectives by the meeting of *Tampere will end, in a near future, in common definitions, in common penal procedures and in common sanctions that States members will apply to crimes of the traffic of persons and to crimes against boys.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, in the month of April of 1999 the European Parliament approved in first reading his legislative resolution on the proposal of the Commission by the that created a general frame in the field of information and query of workers of the European Union.
bottom problem to the that *nos confront #can *resumirse simply like this: or well the system of own resources *nos gives in copartnership, forms part of a package of measures that Parliament will ask to examine in the Conference *Intergubernamental so that it was -as it #would say *yo- more democratic, more participatory, or well, only #can check, lamentably, on point that touches to move piece to the Council, it that it #can last long #if our proposals do not take in account.
has taken reference to the Inner Market, that is the most important frame in the that now we act: in *él it is necessary to put end to the great subventions for coal and the nuclear energy and support to the renewable energies, like important look that is of the environmental politics, has to be realistic.
Without embargo, in spite of the positive general evaluation of the directive, believe that they still remain problems for solving, like the full application of the new diet for citizens of third countries that live in the European Union, and also for #that that coexist out of the narrow frames familiar traditional.
#If it was necessary to invoke an alone reason, #would be the interest of children and doubt that #if Parliament approved these two amendments, *ello *redunde in the interest of children, that expect a lot of the fast establishment of regulation that *les recognise the mere right to not having to suffer the election of parents to live in different #european countries.
Are in query stage of the committees, integrated especially by States members, and therefore #can, before finals of this year, propose an informal definite decision for the approval of map of the Goal 2 of country, as probably of the #others three countries that went object of the first decision of the Commission, on 26 October.
Subject: Violence exerted against women The majority of actions allocated to solve the problem of violence exerted against women are of character *curativo and go directed to women and girls. Is the case of subventions to special centres in the that women #can *refugiarse with children, or the of rehabilitation of the victims of violence.
And the *segunda: How opinion *le deserve pressure actions that is in these moments the Administration of States Joined against #some #european companies -*me refer to the #spanish chain Sun *Meliá and to companies like the Club *Méditérranée and German *LTU- and #which are measures that, to trial, #would have to take the European Union?
The initial difficulties also indicate, nevertheless, and do not owe *hacernos illusions to the *respecto, that the ancient consensus that determined the combination of liberalisation of the world-wide trade and establishment of some compulsory commercial norms, and that always took for granted that #this #would influence of way predominantly positive on the national tendencies, said consensus has begun to crack .
citizens, the no governmental organisations and companies of the European Union go to follow negotiations of *Seattle with greater attention that in #any another previous occasion and will put point of watches in the possibilities that the world-wide trade was as a whole more just, social and *equitativo and take in consideration #all the interests.
Particularly in the field of agriculture, have to respect the conclusions of *Berlín like absolute minimum criterion in the frame of negotiations, as it is not possible to leave to take into account the situation of the small agricultural exploitations familiar and of agriculturalists with a difficult geographic location.
First direction, concretise the principle according to the #which these negotiations have to be useful to the countries and populations with difficulties, with affirmation of the right for the Union and States members to defend development politics and the specific agreements with the *ACP and rejection to see the agreements of *Lomé put in *entredicho by the *OMC.
In case contrary, exists, with reason, the danger to finish in a *American *world that defends trade with enthusiasm, but that forgets the remaining values of the *European *dream, is to say, solidarity in addition to competitiveness, and responsibility in addition to the economic growth #can not be that the goal consist in subordinating #everything to this only paradigm, in that it have to preach from *Seattle to the rest of the world?
As, alas, the parts negotiators *nos follow to distance, the EU needs the additional help of the no governmental organisations- in work for converting to the *OMC in organisation *perdurable from sight point of the environment, of health and of the welfare.
#All coincide in that before enlargement of the Union and the incorporation of new States is necessary to make a fundamental reform that allow to keep the effective operation of the European Union and improve also, add *yo, transparency and control possibilities of the decisions in the field of the #european politics.
To time, there are not obstacles to argue the subject in the meetings of Health Ministers and like this treat to create no collaboration, but yes contacts, and perhaps exchange information among the different countries to treat to develop methods in the different countries of the Union.
Subject: Greater federalism in the adoption of decisions of the EU Subject minister External of *Finlandia took part in July in *Estrasburgo in name of the country that exerts the Presidency of the Council and indicated that, in accordance with the goals of *Finlandia, "the Union has to have an only will, a common politics and an alone voice".
The Commission of Constitutional Subjects, in fact, has admitted three amendments of Mr. *Méndez of *Vigo by means of the *cuales, as a result of the application of the Agreement *Interinstitucional reached in Parliament, has awarded a special paper to the own President of Parliament, to the *cual will transmit informations on deputies.
#Can accept likewise the principle of the amendment 6, that leaves very seated that two games of digital prints are equal *cuando are identical, and no *cuando are only similar. Also accept the principle of the amendment 12, that is directed to clear that data #can not send never to the country of asylum applicant neither use inside a Been member for extraneous ends to the question.
requires a complete application and adapted of the resolutions of Nation Organisation Joined and of the Extraordinary Assembly, and requires, gentleman President and gentleman Commissioner, a special clause against drugs, that include in #all the agreements with third countries, a clause of level and consideration that the clause on the human rights.
In the agreements on the intellectual property, *Europa has to deny to patent life, has to guarantee the maintenance of the exceptions to the general norms of trade concerning medicines used in the fight against AIDS and the other grave illnesses established by the WHO.
Reproach to the conservative Group of Parliament that have procured to suppress the relative considerations to development in the Permanent Forum with the *OIT that has proposed, and that have encouraged it *indecible by *desviarnos of our consistent goals in reaching a balance *equitativo in it social, #as well as a free trade.
2) centres the review in an agenda that only has to see with, essentially, the questions of decision power and corresponding to the new balance among States members, when reducing, in name of equity, weight of States economically less developed in favour of the economically more powerful, to the *cuales pretends to attribute the mechanisms of a reinforcement of influence;
To fault of thing better, will vote in favour of the resolution, by the that asks a moratorium on death pity; but consider that the fact of no *atreverse to adopt a position in favour of the immediate and unconditional abolition of death pity constitutes an abdication in front of barbarism.
Second, in *Kosovo no longer is the #yugoslav army, but our armies. By part, and from point of seen, are a glorious work in the fields of reconstruction, the protection of citizens and the reorganisation, but, of side, are exasperated because they do not reach to protect to persons to the that they have to and want to protect.
The current report speech with total clarity in a series of points and aims in any case with enough clarity that #if no *redoblamos efforts against the instigators and the capitalists of the *narcodelincuencia and money wash, Right states, the populations and youth will lose war.
Have understood that *usted has directed today writing to Defender of the European Village, but #would wish to know when will have deputies the opportunity to answer to appeal of Defender of the European Village to comment query of own initiative.
A substantive politics, of course, and provable by part of *Turquía, of advance by this path. By the path of right state, clear is, by the path of the fine *vecindad and of the peaceful coexistence, by the path of the abandonment in #all the fields of the military methods, especially in *Chipre, but also, how doubt fits, in the question *kurda..
Mrs. *Halonen so only has achieved to insert quotation of society of information - believe that in the last sentence of intervention - and without embargo, according to a document that received of the Commission the past week, in *Helsinki will present initiative relative to "and-*Europa" , a document titled "Society of Information for #All" .
In virtue of #the same, persons and his fundamental rights also remain excluded of the right of sovereignty of the #another splits signatory, further that we always have kept that the requirement of respect of the human rights do not constitutes interference in the internal subjects of a country.
*Turquía, nevertheless, keeps death pity. Now well, although it #can be difficult change mentality of the policemen, change the situation of prisons, suffices a law, suffices a parliamentary vote to abolish death pity, as they have taken #all the countries of the European Union.
In this moment, *yo do not know how decision will adopt the next week in *Helsinki. Nevertheless, in any case, am firmly convinced that the decision that has to adopt the European Parliament on these two regulations will influence on the result of the deliberations still in course and also on the decision that adopt the European Council the next week.
Taking in consideration the request of the European Parliament in the first reading, the Commission gives now the *primer step to incorporate to legislation dioxide broadcasts of carbon and fuel consumption of the light industrial vehicles, is to say, of vehicles of category *M1.
And in this sense go the amendments that have presented to modification proposal of regulation: two in the *considerandos, in the that considers that help formula to transformation is really important, that quota is insufficient and that the Commission goes to present, before the start of the next campaign, a proposal to happen of quotas to thresholds.
With regard to the problem of the double fixation of prices, agree with the idea that we will have to define moment from the *cual the double fixation of prices was absolutely compulsory and is the only form to begin to make #any comparison, although #all are conscious that only in the last months of the year 2001 the public opinion, citizen, will begin for real to take comparisons.
Parliament will ask acceptance of the essence of measures and resolutions of 25 October 1996, the Report *Gallagher, and of his opinion of 26 April 1998 on the application of technical measures in politics *pesquera community.
#If they take into account, among #others, considerations and criticisms relative to the *parco presupposed that *le attributes the regulation and to exclusion of the Common Organisation of Market of almost #all aquaculture, #as well as his partial criticisms to norms referents to information of consumers and to defence of contingents *arancelarios, *cuando exists community production, will improve definitely the regulation.
The first consists in saying that the European Union has not been *recompensada by efforts made and that, beyond all doubt, at all has to expect of Government #turkish, since after the application of the agreements on the Union *aduanera, has not effected, according to #some of colleagues, any sensitive progress.
Regret that in the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer do not have treated to look for a reasonable point of #inspired commitment in the principle of realism.
The agenda includes the questions that remained without solution in *Amsterdam, that are the size and the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the votes in the Council and the possible extension of the vote by qualified majority in the Council, #as well as other subjects related with the Institutions in the frame of the quoted questions.
The fault of transparency has hampered, especially, the taking of decisions in the Council; the Presidency #finnish has begun to put in new practice procedures to increase transparency, and is to expect that #this root before elaborating an official rule.
fulfillment of austerity in the budgetary politics #can not, neither has to, remain under responsibility of Budget Commission, but that the main responsibility, regarding Parliament, *recae logically in the Conference of Presidents and also in the Spokesmen of the political Groups.
The Presidency #finnish of the Council has achieved to fulfil a truly important program; the Summit was hit, a good final brooch for the year 1999 and a good point of game for the future, with the Statement of #Millenium.
The proposal of the Commission has like goal the that the amount of 26 millions of euros was distributed by States members with criterion, in distribution table that take into account, above #everything, the number of appeals of asylum that each Been member have received in the three last years and the number of refugees that found in the territory of each #one of States members in the three last years.
*Yo believe that toll collection also #can contribute in the long run to a reduction of the costs of mobility, #if they achieved the goals that pursue, or was, reduce jams and accidents and, especially, improve the protection of the environment, no only in relation with pollution of the air and noise, but also in #many looks.
Therefore, *yo owe *decirle with clarity to the Council that with initiative fault, to the not considering the proposals of Parliament in the frame of this third alternative that have presented, this week *nos have put in a very difficult situation, next to the limit of it in accordance with the regulations admissible.
The increase -as they said mates- of two grades of temperature, that foresees of here to the year 2010, #if they do not take measures, the increase of level of the sea, the disappearance of small islands and #many of catastrophes of the two last years that, according to experts, have to see with the climatic change, are taken that they had to *obligarnos to adopt immediate and concrete measures already.
Promised to guarantee equality of access of women and his full participation in the structures to be able to and in the taking of decisions, although in any #another field is so great deal inequality among sexes of swear and of *facto that in the field of the taking of decisions.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0077\/1999) of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer, concerning the common position (5748\/1999 - *C5-0034\/1999 - 1998\/0228(*COD)) adopted by the Council with seen to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to substances that exhaust ozone coat (Speaker: Mrs. *Hulthén)
*Nosotros said that it no longer was possible follow to the *OMC without comprising the requirement to include as *primer point of the agenda the principle of caution, the cultural diversity, the social rights, the protection of the environment and the reduction of development inequalities.
*Europa has to support in movement, in this new public opinion world-wide, to promote type of regulation of the international economy, based in redistribution of wealths and in a distinct balance among it that depends of the market and it that it has to follow *incumbiendo to democracy, among it that depends of the *librecambio and it that it has to depend of cooperation.
. (*FR) Have voted against of the resolution project on labeling of alimentary products produced from organisms modified genetically, since has by only object give green light to the Commission with seen to propose a regulation by the that it establish that *cuando an alimentary product contains *OMG that are underneath of the limit of the 1%, labeling that signals presence #would not be compulsory.
Lady Speaker, lady Commissioner, no fits the lower doubt that the *quinta conference of the UN on woman, the Conference of *Beijing, constituted #all a milestone in the path to equality among sexes, since there surprisingly produced the agreement of #all the countries of the UN around a common planetary platform of action.
Since they have suggested parallelisms with *Seattle, wanted to remember that the institutional frame is not #the same, neither neither is #the same the institutional paper that the Commission exerts in New *York and in the Conference of *Beijing that the that exerted in *Seattle, but swims *nos prevents -#if there #be political will- that collaborate the Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, along months, until June, that join strengths.
The application of this rule will carry, among things, to a more effective control of borders and to the reduction of the illegal immigration of citizens of the aspiring countries to adhesion or that get to territory of the Union through these countries.
Fits to remember also that, although Ministers designated by States members for the Council of Governors of the *BEI #be to be #the same that take part in the sessions of the Council of *ECOFIN, the Council of *ECOFIN do not has competitions of type to give instructions to the European Bank of Investments on credit politics or on politics informative.
do not ask information on reasons by the *cuales the European Bank of Investments awarded credit, ask simply #which were the general criteria that justified it and on the base of how assessments considered project -that, on the other hand, affects to #one of the richest regions of #Italia that, among things, characterises by a delicate environmental balance- and conceded credit.
The Council kept a deep debate in the session of days 9 and 10 December 1999 on the communication of the Commission on the new control of the aerial traffic titled " Communication to the Council and to the European Parliament on an aerial space uniform European" .
Gentleman President, as I already have indicated before, the Council has begun to take part in delay problem in the aerial traffic and has demanded that the Commission act in this question, and, as I said in my answer, also have taken progresses in the course of the autumn.
Subject: Referendum of self-determination in the *Sáhara Western minister #moroccan of the Interior, *Driss *Basri, affirmed on 3 November 1999 in The *Aaiún that the referendum of self-determination of the *Sáhara Western, foreseen for 31 July of the year 2000, "will be postponed two or three years" because of the 71.420 resources presented against the provisional census of voters that elaborates Nation Mission Joined for the referendum of the *Sáhara Western.
In the meeting kept on 14 September with the Presidency #finnish, Ambassador *Eagleton urged to the EU to that it transmitted the message to *Marruecos and *Argelia that the international community aspires to achieve the balance in the region of the *Magreb and to that it left clear that, without this balance, is difficult to support the economic recovery of the region.
interpretation recommended by Mrs. deputy to Parliament has virtues and defects, to the equal that occurs with the current practice to observe the valid rule in the procedures of the Court of Justices of the European Communities.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0099\/1999) in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establish measured of fight against the *morosidad in the commercial transactions (8790\/1999 - *C5-0125\/1999 - 1998\/0099(*COD)) (Speaker: Mr. *Murphy)
Gentleman President, today debate at last the definite prohibition of the put in the market and circulation of the *BST in the European Union. Is to expect that with #this reach to put end to a process of ten years in the that the definite decision remained postponed #one and time with the argument that it did not have of definite scientific knowledges that legitimated said definite prohibition.
At the beginning of 1997, in full crisis of cows crazy, the Council had decided to create identification system of animals of the bovine species from production place, #as well as labeling of meat, *facultativo in a first stage, but that it #would be compulsory from 1 January of the 2000.
Has to say that the evolution of the situation is particularly #baffling, had account that the Emir of *Kuwait, State Boss, in a brave decision that the Commission has received with satisfaction, has proposed to recognise to women right of suffrage active and passive.
But, in definite, it that here go to take in these last debates of the year and of the century is to recognise public and formally that #this is subject pending, with it that *ello has to suppose also of commitment of no *cejar in efforts until seeing fulfilled the goal that *nos fix with the approval of the statute of the Court, *presionando also to the Council and to the Commission so that they act in this same sense.
#There is look that wanted to signal to the Commission and to the Council with regard to the amendment 5, that expect was taken into account, as data in *ella requested, according to the Regulation (*CE) 1390\/99, that went in in vigour on 23 November 1999, in article 2, establishes that "each Been member will keep to disposal of the Commission #all data classified by budgetary games that *le will be transmitted to appeal of the Commission in a maximum term of 30 days" .
decided to put in practice two types of financial contests: by part, loans, in moment had reserved 245 millions of euros for loans to these three countries, and on the other hand, donation of 130 millions of euros that had like essential goal the to reduce charge of debt and improve repayment capacity of countries.
It that *nos proposes the Commission is finally reproduce it that took by #Georgia and *Armenia, is to say, foresee, a new loan that #would allow *reembolsar the previous, but in some much more favourable terms with the end to give a bit of oxygen to this country, and foresee donation of 35 millions of euros for the period 2000-2004, with the end to relieve charge of debt.
A modification of the law on the general and direct elections of deputies to the European Parliament #would presuppose that the Council, with assent of the European Parliament, decreed unanimously the corresponding norms and the recommended to States members for approval according to his constitutional norms.
And, especially, do not accept that it pretend to create two categories, to know, Commissioners and *subcomisarios of the European Union, the same that exist Ministers and Secretaries of State, *cuando to time says -and *me *congratulo that the speaker have accepted my proposal in this sense- that competition distribution among Commissioners do not has to be form of *jerarquizar small and great States.
point that have to underline refers to the increase of unemployment tax in the Czech Republic, that, according to the Commission, has to mainly to the *ralentización of the economic activity and of the effect of the process of industrial and economic restructuring of the country.
tendency, very favourable also, affects to the reinforcement of the administrative device of the #hungarian State by means of enlargement of staff -it that in the Commission of course has caused envy- and the organisation of training programs to half term.
Seen the limited time available, #this has not allowed the formulation of a proposal on paper. Yes is clear that the self-evident Commission posture *complaciente, seems that it is prepared to satisfy the objections of the European Parliament and, for *ello, goes to admit modifications in the current proposal.
In the High Half Age, the introduction of the silver penny endorsed by prince was #one of the fundamental instruments to boost the economic development in #all *Europa. With this measure pretended to surpass the derivative difficulties of the private money.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0175\/99) of Mr. *Fayot, in name of the Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary and Industrial Politics, on the communication of the Commission on the financial services: establishment of performance frame (*COM(98)0625 - *C4-0688\/98).
#One of things that expect of coin only is that #one the monetary market in *Europa and carry it to dimension of the monetary market American, so that, of here, #can take out the necessary investments to increase activity of the #european economy and absorb part of unemployment.
politics of the Union #would have to base in a pragmatic approach centred in three key sectors: first, is vital that to the buyers of financial services *les facilitate a clear and comprehensible information; second, claim procedures are fundamental of face to confidence of consumers.
Seat that Mrs. *Benassar *Tous #can not take part especially because we had wished -or at least *yo had wished-*agradecerle sincere and personally work, since it has achieved that it approved program keeping a difficult balance among the spirit and the political meaning of #the same and limitation of a juridical foundation that, lamentably, consider very *restrictivo with regard to the goals of the own program.
Are #all in accordance with that it is necessary to ask to this country a provisional agreement to treat to solve the problem of the alpine ports; without embargo, have to remember the road characteristics of Swiss, an authentic cheese *gruyer with the tunnel of the Saint *Gotardo of 17 kilometres and 3 metres narrower that the of the *Mont *Blanc.
Without embargo, this important file #can not refer only to the good operation of the inner market or of distribution of resources among States members and the Community, treats to struggle of the most effective way possible against the international fraud and delinquency organised.
Firstly, because it centres in the goal to strengthen the independence of the Commission, as it develops it reason exhibition, whereas the recent experience, after the resignation of this institution by reasons of irresponsible management, carries to the conclusion that, by the contrary, is necessary to reduce independence and strengthen controls that exert on #this.
The current environmental problems in the countries applicants are resulted of great broadcasts in the atmosphere *provenientes of industrial activities, of energy production and of transport, #as well as of an insufficient finance and of oversight by it that refers to water supply and waste management.
Gentleman President, *cuando have had to explain the opinion of the Commission of Public Freedoms and Inner subjects in replacement of my colleague, Mrs. *Zimmermann, have said that Parliament is particularly satisfied with the initiative of the Commission and that appreciate it to the acting Commissioner *Liikanen, in name of my #others two colleagues.
Lady Speaker, violence is a specific characteristic of the contemporary society and a *enigma of the open society, society that has lost values and that creates new idols and new symbols *trastrocando at the end these traditional values that, by the contrary, always have constituted the base of coexistence civilised.
Have to manifest explicitly satisfaction by the fact that this intolerable demonstration of the maximum human contempt have left to be *tabú. Every time are more frequent the debates that treat this subject #as well as action programs that pretend to combat it.
#««Treating of a collective resignation of #all members of the Commission owing to the loss of confidence of Parliament, seems that the planned case in the Treaty that presents greater analogy is the of article 144, that contemplates the case of censorship motion decided by Parliament.
section 7 includes a series of ideas on how a more flexible perspective and updated of the labour market and of the greater persons #would allow to reach new modalities of transition of the labour life to retirement by means of new models, like the half labour day for the most greater.
Third proposal: authorise, in accordance with the #italian Government, exceptions to article 92 of the Treaty that refers to helps awarded by States, so as to concede fiscal benefits and incentives to #all employers that set up -and have the intention to set up in the future- and keep in active initiatives able to guarantee employment, #as well as and especially an autochthonous life to #Venecia.
Remember: in approval procedure of the management for 1996 took patent irregularities and contraventions of the Treaty because precisely the Annex *V had had for denial of the approval of the management a greater majority that the that prescribes the own Treaty in article 141 of the Treaty *CE.
In the commission have argued also the question of #if it #would be necessary to put in practice and fund to #european level special programs of employment for specific groups, like youngsters or the unemployed of long length and, in concrete, with additional character to programs of national action and to measures of the structural Bottoms in States members; #this #would be mistaken.
Now arises also by part *socialdemócrata a true support in the field of the set up of this type of structural measures, that precisely are of importance to procure that it guarantee the internal stability of the euro: a low inflation that comports costs lower, that also makes possible by means of these structural measures give employment to more persons.
From sight point, and say #this without exaggerating, #if the Commission had presented to beginnings of December a reasonable proposal relative to the improvement of the fight against fraud *nos #would have saved probably denial of the approval of the management little before Christmas and with *ello *nos #would have saved all it that came to continuation.
Gentleman President, first of all want to add also my voice to praise to efforts for the creation of the *OLAF, and have to say that the session of today is *revestida of solemnity, since those that work in the Commission of Budgetary Control see today materialise some attempts that have demanded efforts and that have known moments of proof in the that it decided #if the proposals #would prosper or #would not prosper.
#There is observations on it that has conducted to this situation that finishes to describe my colleague Mr. *Elles, a new politics of personnel, questions relative to the Offices of Technical Assistance, the report of the Commission of Experts and also #some guidelines for reform of the Commission.
Now well, in our statutory texts, without damage of the modification of the Regulation that go to vote tomorrow, form in that it regulates approval procedure of the budget is written, is there, black on white. #can be in disagreement, but there #be not gone back of leaf, since #if a text presents in Plenary and refuses the proposal with the *cual has agreed said text, the proposal returns to commission.
Is to say, there #be not text of the Council, there #be negotiation draft taken before the entrance in vigour of the Treaty and, therefore, of course, there #be not any official text of the Council and has not sent any text to part.
boss work of company that *le will carry definitely to coordinate better responsibilities of commissioners, to go back to define the tasks that have to make , to suppress #some of #the same and to develop other new, and that *le will carry also to reform management methods, granting methods of agreements, to resort to the *consultores, etc.
Gentleman President proposed, value determination to put ready quickly elements of an organic proposal for this region, so as to that establish a stable relation that give a perspective to the current conflicts and to the potentials that -and here agree with *usted- #can temper and resolve through a strong relation with the European Union.
Without embargo, *cuando observe how act Finance Ministers and, in particular, paper that exerts the group «Euro 11», *me see forced to ascertain that the decisions glide progressively to plane *intergubernamental and that #this offers a scarce *legitimación democratic for decisions of economic politics and monetary important, that go couples to the independence of the Central Bank European.
For the first time, have written that *nos deny to concede said approval of the management, although the past 17 December refuse simply a proposal that *nos got, on the other hand, of the Socialist Group and that had been approved in extremis by a very scarce majority in breast of the Commission of Budgetary Control, proposal that *nos requested to concede the approval of the management.
No combat against the legitimate interests of village #serbian, but that it that wish is the return of Serbian to breast of *Europa and an evolution of Serbian to the incorporation to the *Europa of integration, on the base of democracy and of the legitimate rights of village #serbian.
do not owe today increase the errors of initial trial that gave place to the premature interruption of the process of *Rambouillet, to jump the Security Council, to *marginar to *Rusia, to not appreciating in his just measure the effect of bombardments on village #serbian.
Gentleman President, is evident that in front of the terrible tragedy of #all village of *Kosovo, literally *masacrado and expelled of country by this horrible ethnic cleansing of tyrant *Milosevic, and in front of the consequent and necessary intervention of NATO -a necessary action, but painful, that certainly nobody has wanted neither wished- no *nos #can *atrincherar in formalisms of the international Right or in the evident questions of formal character.
In subjects so concrete and so clear as they are the prerogatives of Parliament, that is not lower of age and to the that, therefore, the Statute has to give a *margen of manoeuvre -#that is the sense of structuring in text base and annexes- so that it #can execute and establish execution disposals of this statute with a distinct diet of the established by article 190.5, so heavy, that demands unanimity in the Council.
#If we do not achieve it, #if it do not adopts a statute this week or in the short term, wish to #all mates hit in confrontation with a public opinion that will have #all the right to doubt that in the European Parliament remain somebody with a minimum of sense of responsibility.
Believe that it is necessary *matizar allusion that takes to credit agreement *hipotecario, because also in point it is necessary to remember that eleven or twelve of States members protect better credit *hipotecario by means of the notarial writing and registration in a territorial register, and, therefore, it is necessary to understand that in the text alludes to stage *precontractual.
Gentleman President, *me refer to a letter that services of Cabinet of President of Parliament *me directed on 20 April happened in reply to information appeal on formality given to the request presented by the spokesman of the unitary platform of neighbours of *Areeta, province of *Álava -populate #where have been born and #where alive, by it that have big interest in this subject-.
In matter of external politics and of politics regarding Nations Joined, whereas European Union have progresses that make and things that say on the two essential questions that are ratification of the statute of the permanent Penal Court and the moratorium of the capital execution that has been asked by a vote of the Commission of Nations Joined in Gin.
But first want to take advantage of occasion to congratulate so much to President of the Council as to President of the Commission for having taken out continuously to collation employment politics and by *haberla followed with perseverance although, lamentably, the plan *Santer have not been followed sufficiently and have *fracasado in the Council.
#One *Europa that no only embrace the economic and monetary cooperation, but #one *Europa that also attend to employment, to the fight against poverty, to care of handicapped persons and of the greater persons, is to say a *Europa that no only want to take out benefit but that also want to be profitable for society in the that have big weight the human values.
The two first steps are as it that have said: first, the famous *leftovers of *Amsterdam, with the additional analysis of the question of #if our current situation in it *tocante to relation among organs forces to modifications of the Treaty and the Letter of Fundamental Rights, of the that have said that it has to be developed by Parliaments.
In it *tocante to the execution and to the management, go to bet in future of consistent mood by decentralisation, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities, enlargement of cooperation to #all levels and a substantial improvement of the monitor, control and the evaluation.
After #everything *eso hid a real attempt to recognise that the Report *Rothley *simpliciter of the past December, evidently, #would not obtain the unanimous approval of the Council; that the text of the Council of the past week, evidently, #would not obtain support of this Assembly.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, #all the insular of the European Union cheered, the night of 2 October 1997, when ascertaining that the Treaty of *Amsterdam signed by the Fifteen contained the first explicit quotations that recognise *institucionalmente the structural and permanent obstacles that suffer the insular regions and the need of *ponerles remedy.
On the other hand, in measure in that *me seems also necessary to get to commitment with the Council and the Commission, have suggested simply to the Commission of Agriculture of this Assembly, -that the has taken #his- commitment amendment that consists in boosting security network *llevándola of 1.560 to 2.000 euros by tonne.
In moment in that *Europa is soul and *cuando President of this Commission, gentleman *Prodi, *nos says that the will find in culture #american, *me ask #if it #can not transmit a bit of enthusiasm to the #european villages *permitiéndoles exert *algo stimulating and that form part of culture, is to say, solidarity in the fight by the human rights through borders.
But, from sight point of member of parliament that, even representing to the whole of *España, represents particularly the interests of the regions *ultraperiféricas, of #any form #would be interesting that the Council took an initiative so that the new Commission #can consider the subject from the principle, since the special diet needs a back development.
Anyway, #if in accordance with the regulations they had assigned by writing this question to *usted or to member of the Assembly, himself\/hisself had been able to proceed like this but, in this case, the Regulation limits the answers by writing to those questions that have not been able to formulate in the course of hour and average of question turn.
#Can ensure besides that it goes to carry out a coherent approach of the rural development keeping groups of local action and contributing like this to avert the times of excessive wait that they #can constitute an important obstacle to the same rhythm of development?
Wanted to give the thanks to the speaker, Mr. *Colom *I Naval, since it has included the amendments of the Commission of Budgetary Control in report on the financial forecasts and the agreement *interinstitucional, and to time wanted to comment the most important, and also the most logical, of these amendments.
Like speaker in the shadow will be able to *pronunciarme on the amendments that have arisen like commitment of negotiations of the Council, *cuando the Council and the Commission *nos ensure that the corresponding modifications go to be really adopted and of mood #can not arise the danger of a third reading.
It peculiar of the system of the European Union is that, during #all these years in that the Council has acted like the legislative authority, has shown also will of delegating application measures in the Commission with the only condition that #this carried out his committed jointly with committees of national civil servants.
And take advantage of occasion - since the quote, lady #Miranda- bear *agradecerle his big work, like the of the that the have preceded: Mr. *Newens, #others that have occupied also of this field and that have taken part, like Mr. *Salafranca, Mrs. *González *Álvarez, and, in general, even #that that always have shown critics or have opted by a much more critical approximation to relations with *América Latin in group.
To end to protect to the patient, is to say, to consumer, and think especially in youngsters, is indispensable that remain guaranteed the application of the Directive 92\/28\/*CEE of the Council, of 31 March 1992, relative to advertising of medicines of human use in the field of the electronic trade of medicines.
Wanted to take advantage of occasion to signal that the Commission of Juridical Subjects has characterised always by the big inner work, the big effort of coordination that take among *nosotros, and to *ello have contributed #many of the that in this moment are here taking part and, especially, #ours speaker, Mrs. #Christine *Oddy, that, with his good take, has facilitated and facilitates always work inside our commission.
Therefore, taking into account #all these facts and not to incur in defect that *nos #can carry to that it had resources in front of the Court of Justice and the lost -as it already has occurred in occasion-, do not have more remedy that keep the criterion of the Juridical Service that this vote is by simple majority, and by simple majority will decide.
Believe that #this are the lessons that have to remember, that it is necessary to expect that the release of the smallest villages in the future produce following the #palestinian method, that #this convert in the normal method and that the #kosovar method was not more that a regrettable exception in the world-wide history.
After all, gentleman President, *Turquía and village, was *cual was his ethnic and linguistic origin, belong to the #european aspiration and to *ellos also *atañen the humanitarian «and» liberal «statements» that the majority of the governments of the European Union, that are members of NATO, affirm to want to apply in our wider region.
By #everything *ello, consider fundamental that the European Union act with big firmness and declare that States members will be of the first in backing ratification of this International Penal Court. Have to put #all obstinacy in that the Court carry to practice and #can not leave this committed in hands of #some States that have deployed enthusiasm #worthy of praise.
Results that this attitude, that #many of *ustedes *tildaron in moment of *antiprogresista, has imposed with time because of the impossibility to solve the problems related with the nuclear energy, the impossibility to solve the problems related with security, storage and costs.
The Commission and Parliament have to satisfy urgently lagoons of the #european social legislation regarding the protection of the atypical employees and have to tackle without more *tardanza the corresponding democratic deficit: through an Agreement *Interinstitucional that *allane the path for the next modification of the Treaty!
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0243\/99) of Mr. *Schmid, in name of the Commission of Public Freedoms and Inner Subjects, on the Resolution project of the Council on the legal interception of telecommunications in relation with the new technologies (10951\/2\/98 - *C4-0052\/99-99\/0906(*CNS))
The proposal of the Commission to reduce now quotas for production and to increase payment compensations for potato starch *me seems a fine idea, especially because there #be determined advances inside the world-wide market that *nos #can surprise in the future.
The goal of the participation of the Union in the *Expo 2000 is to present the crucial paper that is the European Union through institutions, like a dynamic and progressive actor in stage of the world in primes of the century *XXI.
#can not go back to commit errors that committed in *Bosnia, with bureaucratisation and delay of #all the process, but that the European Union has to act with celerity and without bureaucracy; the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament have to assume jointly this challenge so that the suffered persons of *Kosovo, of the #ex-*Yugoslavia and of the *Balcanes have future perspective.
The opinions in this Assembly on #if war was justified or #if it #can have prevented diverge considerably, but the Presidency #german has reached -and here want to mention especially to Subject Minister External- act from a clear position regarding crimes of diet of *Milosevic, but also looking for with *ahínco peace in the *Balcanes.
The national Governments delegate with reason with the #european pact by employment responsibility by employment politics no to level of the European Union, but know that in the era of globalisation it is necessary to find a common answer and #this is hit.
Then all it that say on *Salónica, *Pristina or *Sarajevo no longer will have sense, because today in form to reconstruct with Nations Joined, on the one hand, the European Union, by #another, and the *OSCE, by #another, created -and in *eso *estriba the danger- institutions of dependency in the that reconstruction of the *Balcanes depends of our will, but do not finishes to reach the free determination of villages #balkan to administer to himself\/hisself same.
#This is the core of the subject and #this is the criterion that have used during the debates and in the study made on enlargement of the European Union, a state of democratic Right, #this is the centre of movement, of our Union.
#If we talk of a Stability Pact, is not correct to cover mouth to persons that are instauration of the right and, besides, is necessary that exist a just peace, it that demands that it have action and no the most absolute silence of the serious criminal acts.

#If we had explained although it only went with inspection type that proposes Mrs. #Jackson, protecting earth and the half urban, #would have protected, even indirectly, to the majority of dead persons, to the injured and to thousands of persons that have lost houses days in capital.

A #european democracy requires a process of *constitucionalización, peace order demands value to assume responsibility by the own security, and to take reality the social and ecological space will be necessary that politics *emancipe of ideology *neoliberal increasingly aggressive.
will Have new tensions and wars, as we have had in the *Balcanes, resulted of politics of the two *varas to measure in the field of respect to the human rights and of the independence of villages; will have increase of unemployment, intensification of privatisations, ruin of the small and average peasants, professional, and artisans, restriction of the social rights, constriction of the democratic freedoms.
Gentleman President, of course there are fields in the that it is necessary to issue trials on the Commission, but, to trial, in the first place has to pose very simply the question of confidence; with other words, #can as parliamentary, like representatives of villages, presuppose reasonably that the new Commission will not take path that conducted to the fall of the Commission *Santer?
Know and reaffirm the legitimate doubts in front of the criteria that chaired the individual designation of members by the governments and see with worry that in the composition of the Commission have not taken into account the results of the last #european elections, neither the previous tradition of greater political pluralism.
Second, wanted *recordarle also that Mr. *Fischler *nos announced the mandate written for negotiation of the *importantísimo agree of fishing with *Marruecos, question of the maximum urgency so that Parliament #can follow keeping the budgetary reservation of game agreed by the Council and that was not his Commission, gentleman *Prodi, the responsible that no have finance for this agreement in the future.

#If we reach to strengthen paper of the European Union by means of the creation of a space of justice and of an effective fight against delinquency, will be able to, to time, deleted the known distrust in the possibilities to tighten even more cooperation in breast of the Union.
Lady Speaker, route of the Presidency of the Council by the #european capitals has allowed to identify three spheres to the that Speaker in exercise has referred this morning: asylum and immigration, the fight against delinquency *transfronteriza, and the establishment of a juridical space European.
Lady Speaker, lady Speaker of the Council, is true that with questions pertaining to the juridical field and reflections about the preparation of a Letter of fundamental rights have got to a decisive stage in the evolution of the European Union.
The European Council of *Tampere, fruit of the initiative -because all it is necessary to say it- and obstinacy of President of the #spanish Government, #José #María *Aznar, has to confront this subject with will political that manifested in the extraordinary summit of *Luxemburgo to confront the grave problem of unemployment.
The gradual absorption and historical integration of the Basque Country by the #spanish State, always consequence of bellicose defeats in the past, #as well as of the massive arrival of pertinent immigrants of other areas of the Iberian Peninsula, has supposed a *desdibujamiento and dilution of personality, of idiosyncrasy *originaria #basque.
step "examination" of the school executive future in front of the representatives chosen by the #european citizens represents an important stage of democratisation of the #european institutions that constitutes battle horse of the socialists.
Second, also was a bridge regarding the political priorities that Parliament wanted to establish to the future, to the new #millenium, especially in category 4 -the external actions-, #where the European Parliament took effort to increase commitment credits.
At present has initiated an urgent program of immediate humanitarian help and generous by part of the Union, but time conquered the independence requires support to the economic development, and equally important will be support to the constitution of democratic institutions.
Now want to add three requirements to the already presented: in the first place, it is necessary to demand that the military controls, that know that they have taken part in terror, are expelled immediately; second, it is necessary to send humanitarian help it before possible to *través of program of the THROW and coordinate performance in program on a long-term basis; and finally, like the groups *paramilitares follow *aterrorizando to the population, is absolutely necessary to send international troops of pacification.
Nowadays, in front of the spiral of atrocities in the country and evidence that aircraft have used in attacks against the population of *Timor oriental, Mr. *Cook has effected an amazing twist of 360 grades: the past Saturday cancelled agreement and introduced a temporary embargo of armaments.
Also #would have to ask to Mr. *Cook why money of taxpayers #british has used to fund this scandalous episode and, besides, why Defence Ministry of Realm Joined took part specifically for *cerciorarse that it had invited to the exercise #indonesian to assist the next week to an important fair of armaments in Big *Bretaña.
Subject: Establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of penalties capital In numerous occasions, the *PE has asked that the EU promote an initiative in breast of Nations Joined in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of penalties capital.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, is important that the Union follow of wall development and realisation of this type of projects and that try by #all means contribute to that head offices are it safer possible and to that use or structures do not represent danger for security of citizens of the Union, neither neither for the of the countries in question.
will allocate games back to condition roads for winter, to the twinning of municipalities, for it that is help of States members and, later, the public services, the public buildings, reconstruction of the economy and the creation of institutions.
In other terms, in place, simply, of *centralizarnos in *Tesalónica or in *Pristina, #would have to take out the lessons of *Bosnia, and treat to create autonomous structures able to decide, in *Pristina, way to proceed to the heavy reconstruction, is to say: bridges, houses, streets, #etcetera, and to time way to reconstruct tissue of the civil society.
Gentleman President, the situation in *Kosovo characterises by the *pertinaz effort of the *UÇK for exploding the presence of strengths of NATO and of the *KFOR, with seen to impose the total ethnic cleansing to coast of the #serbian, of the #gipsy and of any #another nationality, except the Albanian, that live in *Kosovo, and to build his own state embezzling the region of the #serbian state.
In section 2, the European Parliament thinks that the preparation of the Letter *incumbirá jointly to the Council and to the own Parliament, *cuando is evident that today the fundamental rights are protected by the national Constitutions and that exercise referent to these rights #would have to affect of way *prioritaria, #if no exclusive, to the national Parliaments.
Is an odd coincidence that a judicial procedure, of #whose cleansing and correction am not fully convinced and that sentence, of the that am still less convinced by fundamental considerations, to know death sentence against Mr. *Ocalan, have taken that it exist a big opportunity to finish with a terrible internal war inside *Turquía.
The Group of the *PPE hails thus the serious efforts of almost #all the political strengths of *Togo so that it was irrevocable course to democracy and to prepare for the next months some elections to the National Assembly that are democratic and free of pressures of the army and of President of State and of surroundings.
In April of the present year, the common position of the European Union consolidated the political decision of October of 1998 with the inclusion of traffic visas and the prohibition of tourist visits to persons affine to the #burmese authorities.
Believe that the big interest that today is building here gives samples that there #be had, to trial, a fault of previous debate with members of parliament, a fault of previous debate with users.
#can not be that the General Direction *III was competent for foods transformed, medicines and the genetically modified organisms, that the General Direction *XXIV in reality also was it a bit, and that, besides, the General Direction SAW and the General Direction *XI have also #any competition in relation with foods for animals.
*Me pleases that in examination go to tackle the main reasons of worry of Parliament in July resolution, #such like sufficient controls in production chain of *piensos for animals, a register of #all producers of *piensos for animals, *rastreabilidad of ingredients of the *piensos for animals and limit fixation for the content in dioxin.
To sight of this modification of the juridical foundation, immediately after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the European Commission modified and reviewed in depth proposal on 21 May 1999, on the base of the *dictamen of Parliament of 11 March 1999.
Without embargo, is important that in the debate of today, in #day of the debate in Parliament on the Conference of follow-up of *Kioto that celebrated in *Bonn, but also #few days after the second nuclear accident graver of #all times (time in a country of advanced technology), also situate program *ALTENER inside a wider context.
The energetic efficiency means lower consumption, conservation of energy sources no renewable and reduction of dependency of energy imports, but especially means inferior levels of environmental pollution owed to hurtful substances, #such as CO2, #one of the most important causes of the effect of *invernadero.
In function of the military operations, the situation of refugees #can aggravate considerably in the case that offensive of the Talibans launched among 180.000 and 200.000 refugees more to Valley of the *Panshir. With the arrival of winter, this region #can convert in valley of death.
Subject: Purposes of the Commission in relation with the fight against drug and prevention of doping in the sportive field Championship of Athletics World of *Sevilla went back to put on the *tapete the question of doping of the elite sportsmen.
since in my opinion the sportive organisations have to assume responsibility in the fight against drug use in sport, *me ask #if there are plans to initiate *algún type of collaboration with the sportive organisations Europeans to end to resolve this problem that has arisen in the last years.
Takes some ten days celebrated in New *York an extraordinarily positive meeting, together with the Presidency and Subject Minister External of *Portugal, with the Regional Association of the #Asia Meridional, headed by his splendid President, Subject Minister External of *Sri *Lanka, that was -gives the chance- #mine mate of faculty.
By it other, in February of this year ask to the #spanish authorities that watched with special attention crop conditions, crop and transformation, so as to avert premium "hunting" Today same have had news through newspapers that a region of *España also has taken letters in the subject and has withdrawn subvention to varied producers.
*Usted knows, gentleman Commissioner, that in *España today no only newspapers of more thrown but practically #all the #spanish press brings in cover the grave irregularities found by inspection of the Council of Agriculture of Community Joint of *Castilla-Stain in the transformative companies of linen that were in *litigio and that have been heard and analysed by the commission to the that has taken quotation.
Second, in the question *kurda have given some first steps -although under the miserable circumstances of conviction to death of *Ocalan- to a political solution and in the field of the human rights no only has produced the release of *Akim *Birdal -although it only was by reasons of health- but that have produced also #some legal changes that expect carry likewise to practice.
My Group believes that discipline of candidate condition will comport a more serious preparation of *Turquía for adhesion, a firmer dialogue and a greater exhibition to culture and politics of the European Union.
The #turkish public opinion, the public opinion advanced, political, social and business *nos sues a clear message, but this message includes approximation among the European Union and *Turquía and, to time, impulse of the democratic values that, sure enough, today follow without fulfilling .
The international legality do not looms with using violence, do not serves of the political blackmail to predominant states, of doubt on borders and of bonds that derive of the international treaties, and in general, of posture *provocadora in the international life.
appeal of *Turquía has to evaluate on the base of the following criteria: his geographic and economic situation of strategic importance and the repercussions for *Europa; the fundamental paper of *Turquía like member of NATO and how #can keep said association #if we follow continuously *dándole with the door in noses; *Turquía, that as future responsible member of the EU #can convert in the *apaciguador of dissatisfaction that arises in Orient Half and further.
The agreement of *Ankara is not sufficient reason as from this agreement with the *CEE, *Europa has shown disposal and capacity by means of three modifications of the Treaty, the European Only Record, the Treaty of *Maastricht and the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to transfer more competitions of the national level to European and deepen in this way *Europa.
The goal #would be to deepen the questions that still pose problems: the questions related with the human rights and minorities, as it is natural, but also those questions that have to see with the economic relations, on purpose of the *cuales *Europa has to fulfil commitments on the union *aduanera and accelerate the preparation of the corresponding financial protocol.
With reason of these technical votes on veterinary and phytosanitary questions, #would wish to remember the importance that has the fact that the countries members of the European Union conserve, *soberanamente, in the national plane, freedom of trial and of decision on #all the relative questions to the alimentary security.
Also have responsibility to choose among fears *milenaristas, resistance to change, and the opportunity to make, in the frame of globalisation for growth, the human development and the protection of the environment.
Gentleman President, agriculture will follow being, as, #one of the most important files of the next negotiations of the *OMC, and our #european institutions seem to put of agreement so that it recognise our agricultural model European, so that it protect to consumer and to consider that the agreement of *Berlín is the frame of the mandate of negotiation of the Commission.
Therefore, will comprise *usted, gentleman Commissioner, worry with regard to the apparent absence of points of common sight, in breast of the Union, before the beginning of negotiation, *cuando States Joined seem to have very clear opposition to the system of #european helps, *disculpándose elegantly of flexibility payments.
*Cuando celebrate our debate in audition with Commissioner takes roughly month, my commission, the Environment Commission, was really quite divided with regard to the suitability to present relative measures to trade of broadcasts, but believe that it costs pity explore line.
Nevertheless, my question to the Council is the following: do not believes the Council that the own #european institutions have the duty to give example in the subject of equality, and is satisfied the Council with the current situation of personnel of the institutions?
These facts are of a special gravity in a territory like the of the European Union, #where the protection of the human rights is a fundamental subject, more still in these moments in that it works in the preparation of a European Letter of the Fundamental Rights.
With the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam on 1 May, according to the new article 13, the Council has the possibility to adopt measures for the fight against #everything of type of discrimination, included discrimination by reasons of sexual orientation, but always inside the frame that establishes the Treaty and without limiting the application of regulations.
Subject: *Incumplimiento of the regulation 1239\/98 on reduction and disappearance of networks of derives The Council of ministers that took place in *Luxemburgo in June of 1998 decided the disappearance of networks of derives in fishing of tuna for the 1.1.2002, and, by means of the regulation 1239\/98, the minimum reduction of the fleet in a 40% for the year 1998 and the annual preparation of lists.
Results even more surprising that the General Secretary of the European Parliament, violating perhaps unintentionally reservation duty, take a preface in the that *elogia yearbook, and in the that it #can read , in particular, that is an useful reference for business men and that even constitutes a true public service!
Am fully convinced that I #can support, together with my Group, the report of president Mr. *Napolitano, because the modification of the Regulation and decision proposal answer seriously to worry of no subject to deputies to excessive and arbitrary controls, worry that finishes to show also Mr. *Dell' #Alba.
Gentleman *Bourlanges, *usted signals with #all reason that no only takes part the question of a more suitable control and some more ideal agreements -that also are important looks-, but that besides is precise to answer to a fundamental question, to know: of how subjects has to take charge the public administration and #which #can entrust to low private companies determined conditions?
The perspectives of *Edimburgo *nos fix a higher ceiling and the Council *nos gives a budget always more reduced, which takes that it was necessary *arañar of actions in matter of development, for example, of human rights and #many actions, to fund the priorities that fix, and is not #ours fault #if *Europa is the big treasurer of the external politics.
#If there #be not possibility to access to services of reproductive health, #all family suffers the consequences, especially boys, that in the worst of the cases also die *cuando dies mother or leave to assist to school and are badly fed.
#This reflects the fundamental orientation of the #european institutions, attendants to facilitate activity of the great capitalist groups, included it that *ella has of more *nefasto for society, like dismissal plans that are responsible of the gravity of unemployment and of the extension of misfortune.
Have the possibility to leave clear in front of citizens and citizens #which are our goals to *través of program directed to youngsters, of program #Socrates, of the cultural program, of looks relative to women and to equality of opportunities.
In what they fulfil the relative conditions to the processing and the internal procedures *interbancarios, the banking sector #would have to can reduce substantially price of credit transfers *transfronterizas and reduce execution time to the necessary for the domestic payments more day.
*Yo support, therefore, the request of the report of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects by the that urges to #ECB to that it adopt immediate measures to take fully effective at least the specific relations with the European Parliament that foresees the Treaty of the EU.
*Nosotros believe in the independence of the Central Bank, but this Central Bank is much more independent that the *Bundesbank or that the North American Federal Reservation, because no is born of act of Parliament neither #can be modified with act of Parliament, because it do not coexists with an economic Government.
Expect that, in base to the decisions of the Council to create on a long-term basis some common procedures of management of asylum and to concede a situation of equality in #all the Union for the legal refugees, have opened path that convert to *Europa in a zone *homogénea in matter of asylum and shelter.
The second significant look is -by it that *Tampere has constituted hit- that for the first time has produced a clear delimitation in asylum politics, the politics of labour migrations and in politics for the received of the displaced by wars, of temporary refugees, with some first concrete measures to the *respecto.
According to record of this conference, the specificities of the #european villages #would have to melt , in effect, as in a *melting *pot world-wide, in the that -quote- "the rights and the obligations of the *migrantes #would have to be similar to the of citizens of the European Union, the statute of citizens of third countries #would have to be similar to the of citizens of States members" and *ello in function of a supposed principle of no discrimination.
The invitation to the Commission to value the possibility to create a budgetary reservation to the *respecto will be important, but follow being very little still. Is precise that the European Union in group take charge of the extraordinary influx of immigrants no community with a strong action of solidarity to the most exposed States, in particular #Italia.
In effect, the *scoreboard is not so only an instrument of legislative programming, is also strengthening instrument of transparency and responsibility of #all the #european institutions bear with citizens, because citizens are owners of the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice.
*Señorías, do not talk of a definite reform of the #european institutions, but of a sufficiently strong reform to avert the blockade of the institutions or asphyxia; of a sufficiently strong reform, as it said the #another day #one of His *Señorías, that allow in the future other evolutions.
And in any case, from the European Parliament, #can not but encourage to that this text include a systematic approximation to #all looks of the European Union so that the new conference *intergubernamental occupy, one by one, of #all the subjects and the problems that *nos occupy in this moment; taking into account logic #aristotelian, is to say, that political is art of it feasible.
Now well, the same that economists grouped in Association by the Monetary Independence of *Francia, consider that this goal is not desirable and that onº 1 January 2002 it will be necessary to conserve simultaneously, by part, the national coins and, by #another, the euro, that will exert paper of common coin.
capital release, the suppression of the economic borders, the change of models owing to the high technology and of society of information, the world-wide competition, are elements that many times comport changes and brusque restructurings in the industrial production.
#That is the spirit of the resolution that propose to His *Señorías and only with conditions will keep *Europa his political paper when allowing an economic development for real durable of companies and when protecting the rights of employees that are -no it is necessary to forget it never- strength alive.
In particular, consider that the case that today are has to represent occasion so that the Commission assume, today, in front of the European Parliament, commitment to value and review the directive on dismissals and company closing, so as to *convertirla in more effective in terms of protection of work places.
It that the European Union has claimed with firmness has been: in the first place, that with independence of worry by terrorism *checheno - that it is comprehensible - is weight argument to cut across the problem of a proportional way; second, defended with *tesón a reduction of climbing and the political dialogue.
#All know that our cultural coordinates have to see with mood to be in the world in what #european and that bottom action linked with the cultural life in his multiple expressions is condition *sine *qua *non for the strengthening of a consciousness of #european identity.
will Allow valorisation of a common cultural space allocated to boost the creation, cooperation, exchanges, *salvaguardar and give to know better heritage and history of the #european villages and boost the full development of cultures.
Obviously, it is necessary to avert reopen the debate that already have made this morning so much on the agreement reached among the Groups on #if had or did not have to mention company of the that so much has talked this morning as on the specific question of #if the signatories of a determined text of commitment knew or did not know that it had changed part of the text.
Have communicated to the Moroccans that are had to contribute to the solution of the existent problems in the frame of program *MEDA, but as I already have said, the #moroccan part still has not engaged to the definite implantation of the system proposed.
Lady Speaker, wanted to take explanation relative to my observance of the Regulation of Monday happened on distribution of repertoire of the House of American Trade in *Bruselas that contained informations gravely erroneous on me, on deputies of my Group, but also on numerous deputies of this hemicycle.
In bottom, sure enough, the crisis has to to obstacles raised so much by the European Union as by the *OMC to the application of the principle of caution. way to apply adequately the principle of caution is to go back to a true subsidiariness, no *trastornarla as it has taken in name of ideologies *librecambistas and federalistic
Gentleman *Fischler, and also *me direct to gentleman *Byrne, the last events in the crisis of the *EEB, or the *beef *war, that no longer limits to *Francia and Big *Bretaña -in this moment also States *federados of *Alemania adopt a frankly negative posture-, leave clear that *nos find in front of an enormously difficult task and that before that at all we have to elaborate politics of the responsible and transparent consumers.
In relation with the agency, it only that *puedoe take is to remit to His *Señoría to the answer that have given to Mrs. #Jackson, in the sense that I am convinced that the creation of an agency of alimentary security centralised in level of the Commission will be a big step to delete this type of difficulties.
And #this *sucede because managers of the dramatic promotion of unemployment are the own politics that is and the initiatives that are. politics that gives absolute priority to the economic look in relation with the social, to the *sostenimiento monetary in front of the social security and that proclaims like maximum law the stability pact, that has to apply without hesitating.
It that fear is that dialogue *macroeconómico try to export to scale #european method and the system of *concertación in #Italia, that is method that has carried country to growth levels lower, to unemployment taxes higher and to inflation levels higher.
Like this, the subjects now are the transitory disposals on doctors in training, the subject of application period of the total of the directive and the limits of work time for crews of fuselages *pesqueros.
By #this, in speaker quality, *yo recommend that this democratic look integrate in the scientific and technical cooperation, is to say, that Argentinian members of parliament and of the European Union, or was, the European Parliament, also keep dialogue in scientific matter and of investigation, and possibly also establish new priorities.
That at present they transport to thousands of kilometres of distance through *Europa #some isolated components of product, for afterwards return part of #the same to the country of origin, no only indicates that the costs of transport are too much low, but also that *algo fails in the system, in restitution system by exports, for example, or in the of the regional denominations of origin.
Is *algo that it has to determine in each case, although it wanted to underline look that also remains of self-evident in #one of paragraphs of the resolution proposed. With *eso *me refer to the big importance of the mutual recognition of norms, since this procedure guarantees a fast application, a big flexibility in a world that changes very quickly and a greater respect of the purpose of subsidiariness.
Regarding university readers #italian that do not possess nationality #italian, #can communicate to Mr. *MacCormick that today same have signed a letter to the *respecto #whose addressee was member of the European Parliament that had formulated complaint in this same sense.
*Nos please the comments of the Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary that it #would have to take special upsetting in the need to reduce the administrative costs and the fiscal charges for #SME and that #this represent #one of the greater obstacles for growth of employment.
The three commissions to the that belong #can identify with his excellent work -made under a considerable pressure of time-, anyway Employment Commission and Social Subjects and the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects and only with #any reserves Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities to the *cual is applicable *aquello that less it #would have been better.
*Me *congratulo that the Treaty of *Amsterdam recognise to the European Parliament the possibility to add more closely to the application of the European Pact for Employment and that, thus, our Assembly have been able to manifest about the guidelines of States members for the year 2000 in matter of fight against unemployment.
In *tercer place, the Council showed #one reservation in the introduction of vehicle especially compatible with the environment -in point have proposed #some additions- and in the strict control of the avoidance of the *cycle *beating, as it has *sucedido also in States Joined, is to say, that manufacturers #can delete without more values limits by means of electronic manipulations.
Likewise *me seems especially significant recognition of the important paper that exert the no governmental organisations and networks *multidisciplinarias, #as well as the public organisms that already make a valuable work, in particular in the field of prevention, support and the protection of the victims.
In 1999, to celebrate the *décimo anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of Boy, gave an active priority to the rights of boys inside the #european initiative for democracy and the human rights, chapter *B. 7\/7 of the budget of the European Union.
Therefore, have to proceed jointly to be able to include the existent procedures and that for the Commission are formal procedures, to know, intervention of the supervisory committee and on the other hand the right of Parliament to listen to candidates and to know the position of the supervisory committee.
Gentleman President, gentlemen Commissioners, although weight of the environmental values has grown along the years, the goal of the energetic politics of the Union has to follow being security in energy supply in the national economies, #as well as in industry of *Europa, to competitive prices.
To the light of the statements of Commissioner *Byrne, see it that says the Group of Permanent Work of Medical European Auxiliaries: "investigations have shown that long periods in sail like the that confront the auxiliary doctors (that they work *demasiadas hours) reduce performance to a similar level to the of the excessive consumption of alcohol".
. (*FR) In spite of his general title, time withdrawn gift paper, early remains of self-evident that the resolution proposal presented by Mr. *Chichester is allocated first of all to boost the nuclear industry with the pretext that it produces little CO2, at least in the relative stage to head offices.
Consider very problematic to apply scales out of the Community, including cases here mentioned and believe that #all #would take well #if we took of the closing scale no only for the *Europa oriental but also for the energetic politics inside the European Union and did not put in danger the existent possibilities like consequence of an additional deregulation.
As I said in occasion, #one of the goals of the establishment of similar system of proofs was the to watch by that it had a system of equal proofs in #all the European Union to end to determine the levels of contagion in #all the EU and, in particular, determine how measures #can be necessary.
Since it treats of community companies and that there are proofs of protection concealed by part of representatives of the European Union in said actions of *hostigamiento, how concrete actions have undertaken to ensure the interests of companies mentioned? How goes to guarantee that they develop freely activities, with the end to prevent his illicit replacement by companies and interests and illegal circuits organised?
To combat violence requires a double strategy: by part, is necessary to centre in the structural causes that the cause, is to say, in attitudes and the masculine behaviours; by #another, is necessary to have of legislation that forbid type of violence against women, included the domestic violence.
My Group, the Group of the Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers European, feels firmly engaged with the general concept to develop capacity of autonomous action European that has been identified aptly like capacity of fast intervention with the necessary logistical support.
At all shows it with greater clarity that the case of banana agriculturalists *caribeños, that find among the most vulnerable producers of the world, #whose access to the markets of the EU has been now declared contrary to the regulation of the *OMC, as a result of which confront to the devastation of means of life.
In my country, *Finlandia, is already in course project for the years 1998-2002 on prevention of violence exerted on woman, directed by Health Ministry and Social Subjects; also from sight point, the approval of program *DAPHNE has had a big importance.
Considering the deficient confidence in the Union shown, among things, in the low figures of participation in the elections, and the importance that the EU keep character of a Union so much of citizens as of States members, think that it is not correct to aspire to the financial autonomy or to the total independence of the contributions of States members.
The Nordic Green Left (*NGL), composed by the #scandinavian members of the Group *GUE, has voted today in favour of the relative report to recognition and the execution of judicial resolutions in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility on the common children.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, finishes to produce an extremely important announcement: the peace process in *Irlanda of North, even with #all difficulties that have gone presenting, has given today same a step advance with the decision of IRE to board negotiations with the Commission for Disarmament.
In the sector of the agricultural production, in addition to taking into account the principle of caution, it #would be necessary to talk to favour vicinity of production to consumption spots and to support the regional alimentary chains.
By #this *yo *le ask to Mr. *Cunha, for example, that in quality of speaker of the sector of agriculture take into account also to the sector of fishing, although exploitation methods are basically distinct, time that *él also is my coordinator in Fishing Commission.

will Have to watch, especially, to resist to pressures of the that it will be able to be object by part of the Council or of the European Parliament so that it expand action radio to fields no established on purpose in the Treaties and for the that, by *añadidura, as we have been able to observe in the recent past, *usted will not have of the administrative or financial means necessary to face up to #the same.
The goals of negotiation have to require with total clarity in negotiation mandate conceded by the Council, with the agreement of the European Parliament, to #whose representatives will have to keep closely informed on development of said negotiations, to the equal that *sucede in practice with members of Congress of States Joined.
Already have enumerated #some points and have not mentioned transparency, change of the organisational models, change in relations among the Commission and Parliament, change in relations with the administrative structures.
The first observation is in answer to the words of Mr. *Herman of takes moment and relative to the fact that *usted have decide to subject to approval the modifications of the Annex *V to the Regulation by absolute majority of deputies to Parliament; *usted was in it true when proceeding of way, because it adjusts to the Treaty.
Is reason by the that I want to take upsetting, together with speaker, in that the Court of Accounts is in moment in right to control compliance of utilisation of the group of credits assigned to the budget of Parliament with norms in vigour.
is not of receipt that in answer to the grave conclusions of the annual report of the Court of Accounts on the previous exercise, the Economic and Social Committee have considered inopportune that the *UCLAF have access to this *dossier and commission to define any possible implication and administrative responsibility, as it demands *insistentemente Parliament.
Is true that the most visible things are the tragic conditions of the fields, without embargo, his *Señorías, have to know that the immense majority of the deported are received, as #all know, by #albanian families or *macedonias very poor and #one of the greater efforts that are is help to families precisely to avert that they arise social tensions and to avert that, after month of generous received, are expelled and arise social problems.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0227\/99) of Mrs. *Müller in name of budget Commission on state preliminary draft of forecasts of income and of costs of Parliament and forecast state of income and of costs of Defender of Village for the exercise 2000.
The Council did not agree and added article 99 of the Treaty like juridical foundation as a result of sight point of ministers, that consider that disposals relative to the annual taxes by vehicle in Chapter 2 the take a fiscal measure extremely important.
The preparation of a Letter of this type #would be a typical task for deputies -are the most indicated for *ello and, therefore, have to take it- and our proposal on how has to develop in practice the Letter of Fundamental Rights will have in any case fully in account look.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, believe that, in addition to enlargement, the European Union confronts today the need to give concrete political answers and perceivable by citizens and -will say more favourable- «» for citizens, men and women of *Europa, concerning a group of problems of the that a lot it depends our future.
Has been missing political will to use in this sense the current Treaties and fear that, finished the «cold war», have the one who *aventure to lose will of political integration that it is the base of our realisations and of peace in *Europa.
Like instrument of the politics of labour market and of development of the human resources, Bottom goes to be to time a central element of the #european strategy of employment and of an active politics of labour market.
In this frame, have to say that the European Commission moved in the correct direction in proposals on Diary 2000 and wanted to, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European, congratulate by posture, and also by the that kept during negotiations, to Mrs. *Wulf-*Mathies, to Mr. *Fischler and to Mr. *Flynn.
amendment 2 had by object force to the Commission to review parameters of guarantee bottom in his annual reports, and now, after the political decision, the Commission will have to review parameters of guarantee bottom with each new adhesion.
This fundamental part of the package of Diary 2000 has the double attribute to be the *primer juridical text arisen of Diary 2000 that reaches a common position in the Council and, without embargo, is the last in being approved by the Council and the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, also *yo go to talk of the Social Bottom European, but from sight point of the external economic relations, for having been *yo the author of the opinion of the Commission of Relations Economic External.
Besides, #if we go in in defence dynamics of territorial interests in the that has gone in the European Council in *Berlín, like deputy chosen by citizens of a concrete zone of *Europa -a region called *Aragón-, neither #can vote in favour of Diary 2000 because, with agreement, citizens to the that represent go out very prejudiced in regard to the current situation.
since, in reality, resources #can not obtain by means of the creation of tax on CO2 , as they think *Ripa gave *Meana or the Greens, because it never has seen that the carbonaceous gas produced imposed -of it contrary, the *Pinatubo #would launch probably euros-, only remains, as, a source of resources: the #european tax on income.
contradictions of the proposals of the Commission for restructuring of the fleet that is object of norms, that demand a national programming by comparison to the regions of the Goal 2 that remain subjected to the regional programming, #would serve only to increase confusion in other questions.
Is precise *oponerse and modify a clearly discriminatory redesign as it #would be a less favourable formulation of the coastal regions of the Goal 2 in relation with the dependent regions of fishing of the Goal 1, with it that #would suppress distant regions of the coast that demand structural finance to support activities of aquaculture and processing.
Gentleman President, no fits doubt that Diary 2000 will bring achieve enormous changes in the European Union, already was for agriculture or for the regional politics. In this last field, have to admit that *me has produced a deep disappointment the fact that *Irlanda of the North do not appear already inside the Goal 1.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate on the report (To4-0169\/99) of the *Sra *Aglietta, in name of the Commission of Institutional Subjects on decision proposal of the Council by the that establish modalities of the exercise of execution competitions attributed to the Commission (*COM(98)0380 - *C4-0501\/98-98\/0219(*CNS)).
By a very simple reason: the *comitología is, as #all know, hell; is an apparently technical problem, without embargo, in reality, is a deeply political problem because, to end of accounts, treats of the problem of control of the execution, of responsibilities in control of the execution.
In last place, but no thus less important, appears the procedure *reglamentador. To this *respecto, consider unlucky that after discussions in breast of the Council have *desestimado the proposal of the Commission regarding the return to Parliament and, often, to the *colegisladores, *cuando a committee have not issued a favourable opinion.
Also want to express satisfaction because the explanations and explanations that *nos has provided tonight Mr. *Marín satisfy fully claim expressed by the Commission of External Subjects -in the opinion of the that *yo have been speaker- that Parliament went informed of the evolution of negotiations before conclusion.
In this moment, the session of today has character *nostálgico, because we are at the end of the term of office, and #some of the colleagues will not go back, #others perhaps go back, but, in definite, the current Parliament dissolves, and in this moment there #be a true element *nostálgico, a #twilight environment in this session.
politicians create conditions and the suitable climate so that it produce growth. The electronic trade has an enormous potential for the #european industry, by it that we have to watch by that it do not adopt any political decision that force to providers in Internet to establish out of the Union.
In consequence, has taken a technical assistance to the consistent Palestinian Authority in an international squad that goes to work during two years with the #palestinian authorities so as to that it was the Palestinian Authority the that take responsibility of the management of hospital.
Of form, the countries mentioned by Mr. *Cars perhaps drop in account that death pity really is the worst instrument so that #one #can recover the human dignity. And is that person has to have the opportunity to amend errors.
To the Commission follows *preocupándole the possibility that the persistence of restrictions of the fundamental human rights #such as the right of peaceful meeting and freedom of expression and opinion, have like result a climate of unsteadiness and social agitation in *Malasia.
Afterwards, in the current crisis it is necessary to underline -and neither is of style say it in enclosure- responsibility of the Organisation of the African Unit, theoretically commissioned to reconcile to the populations of the Big *Comora and of *Anjouan, after the secession of this last island.
Gentleman President, in 1993, the entrance in vigour of the only market and the dismantlement of the border controls have involved the suppression, in the statements of VAT, of statistics of sake exchanges among States members, #whose reliability was guaranteed by #customs services.
Have voted against of the #european textile market because the proposal is too much protectionist and do not loans sufficiently attention to the importance that the export of textile products and of preparation *reviste in the poor countries that try to reach development of economies.
Possibly #can result difficult that get to the 626 members, it more logical #would be that #if, truly, exists a report #such, and #if *usted corroborates it, deliver, for example, to President, to the Table of the Commission of Budgetary Control, and to the coordinators of #all the Political Groups that are represented in the Commission of Budgetary Control.
By it other, *me seems that the designation like representative of the External Politics and of Common Security of the General Secretary of NATO crimps pretty much curl and remembers sentence of a diplomatic French that said that so *ilusorio is to want to take a #european defence with time like taking the Central Bank European in *Fort *Knox.
Parliament will have to take use in whole of audit right and of control right with regard to the institutions, also included the Commission, but in this difficult situation will have to assume responsibility in it that concerns to the need that the new Commission #can begin to work it before possible.
do not want to talk of the nomination of the #german candidate that, in view of the elections, has been a slap, by it that to finalise want to expose a wish: while dictator *Milosevic was to control in Serbian do not has to flow neither peseta neither any euro of the #european taxpayer to Serbian.
Without damage of the management of Commissioner *Fischler, went almost reform of the status *quo that did not guarantee the wished balance among agriculturalists, regions and cultures and in the that agriculture #mediterranean resulted once again abused by the *PAC, did not guarantee the put in practice of the #european model of agriculture, in #whose field did not take almost swims to help to the small agriculturalists, and, finally, went #few advances in matter of rural development.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Commission, in the month of January of this year, Parliament approved the report of Mr. *Brok that asked that, preferential and mostly, the new Commissioners went members of the European Parliament and persons with experience in the #european Institutions, that guaranteed a suitable equality among men and women and a just balance of the political tendencies.
To finish, believe that it is indispensable in occasion encircle no only to the that they will be the facts, taking it with a logic that was not the to move to Plenary avatars of the national controversies, but especially take it through a narrower relation among the Institution that *usted chairs and Parliament.
Some that the creation of an Agency did not resolves of by himself\/hisself the problem; without embargo, already will see how will structure and will convert in operative organism that #would wish that it guaranteed fast interventions, effective, useful, rational and balanced with the just participation in reconstruction, especially of the that, as #Italia and *Apulia in particular, as a result of war and of the migratory phenomenons, have seen prejudiced in economic terms of tourist flows and of global image.
The question is #if the group of the Council is decided, and #if #all *nosotros are decided in a hard period, characterised by the competition and by the challenge of globalisation to #whose height pretend to be to give answer, by part, to the problems of #all, is to say, to development and to the *Tercer World, that has truly need of support of *Europa, and, on the other hand, to accelerate enlargement.
Without embargo, will result, definitely, more economic for the European Union install it in *Salónica and do not know #if the Commission has taken duties and has comprised that will pay wages much higher, that there #be not infrastructure in *Pristina, that will see forced to pay a lot to guarantee security of civil servants, that will run danger in territory unsure.
Think that the Council of Ministers has had reason to the subject this subject to the Court of Justice of compliance with article 213 of the Treaty, that forbids to Commissioners accept, even after the cessation of functions, put that the #would plant in a delicate situation concerning obligations in matter of #probity and delicacy.
Finally, want to review the valid norms on the indications of the initial products, specifically, norms on signs that have to carry labels of pastures, *piensos or thread mixed, in the sense that, in a future, indicate quantity used of initial products used, although no breakdown according to the different products.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, #if *me allow, wanted to concentrate my intervention in *usted, gentleman President of the Council, because I believe that the European Council has played a very small paper in the #european discussions of the last years and has kept a so much *distanciado *cuando treated to take out chestnuts of fire.
Without embargo, *yo #would wish to insist to the *respecto, lady Speaker, because in spite of being a lower question, without great consequences for life of countries, exist other much graver questions, in #whose case the Commission guides by mentality extremist, it that it #can involve distortions very grave in the economy of countries and in the situation of employment.
#If Glass of the World resulted hit also in plane, #if the number of incidents was relatively limited, *ello obeys to that said control of the *taquilla allowed, for example, that cooperation *anglo-#french in matter of security was effective with regard to the received, follow-up and control of follower groups and that averted #some phenomenons of vandalism, that do not wish that they go back to repeat in our continent.
My group do not ignores the light trip of the centre of gravity of the Commission to Parliament that finishes to produce in measure that #this confirms in front of the eyes of the public opinion that #can achieve that they move the centres to be able to, even those considered like *intocables, which is very important.
In particular, relations among the European Parliament and the European Commission have to be based in work and harmony, to guarantee the maximum possible efficiency in the approval of the key elements of our community legislative requirements.
has *rasgado the Letter of the Organisation of Nations Joined, the international helps, the predominance of States Joined was the only reason of war -affirmation of his geopolitical vision- and has caused worry in the old friends of States Joined of *América as *Helmut *Schmidt.
*Ustedes propose an ambiguous answer regarding the Organisation of Nations Joined, subordinated to States Joined in the military terrain, in a totally dogmatic condition with regard to the processes of globalisation of the world-wide economy that *merman strongly the #european autonomy.
*Me odd the fault of a strong speech and original of the Commission in terrain of culture, of mass communication, of the artistic and cultural production, in that it is a challenge and a simple and deaf resistance by part of *Europa to a North American penetration.
Without the realisation of this deepening in that it assent the new institutional order that will have to assign to *Europa paper in the world, *nosotros will not be some effective promoters of peace and justice neither will be able to conciliate the needs, sometimes found, of northeast and #european southwest.
In matter of fiscal politics, in particular, *nos have seen especially disappointed by the feeble conviction expressed by commissioner proposed in the subject of development of coordination of the fiscal diets and of the need to happen to the rule of the qualified majority in the next *CIG.
Have received of the technical Group of independent deputies, of compliance with paragraph 4º of article 180 of the regulation, impugnation of interpretation proposed by the Commission of Constitutional Subjects to paragraph 1º of article 29 of the regulation.
Took a statement that to me *me seemed very *convincente, specifically said: "Yes, go to respect subsidiariness principle, or was, that the first decision corresponds to States members and to the regions, but in quality of Commissioner *yo will be manager that they fulfil the goals of the regional politics and *me propose to fulfil with my responsibility."
As well, together with adherents will take all it possible so that life was it shorter possible, but fear that #this was not sufficient, and therefore, expect that at last the European Parliament and the Commission take to hear voice, so as to that the elderly of #all the fifteen States members obtain respect that deserve and have first of all norms that *les allow to keep intact money that pay monthly and *obligatoriamente to have pension in the future.
But *yo had requested the word, in accordance with article 122 of the Regulation, to consume intervention turn by personal allusions, in relation with indictments that yesterday took to person Mr. *Galeote during investiture debate of President *Prodi.
The Constitutions of States members, the *CPDH and other treaties already offer sufficient protection to citizen. So it swims to bank type of legal diets, as it proposed the week happened Minister of the Interior of the Low Countries.
#Can *resumir like this the questions that have formulated the public opinions: ?in how contributes *Europa #one *plusvalía and improves adoption systems of decisions? ?*Nos has contributed *Europa an upper economic growth, a greater welfare in the daily life or hope to take part in a big adventure?
Said of mood, the object of the next *CIG #would not have to be the to strengthen this institutional process, but, to the contrary, the to lighten it, is to say, limit competitions of the Union going back to a Common Market respectful of the environment and of the public health.
Gentleman President, the #french delegation of my Group, as also the #danish delegation, already have exposed in the main debate why fundamental reasons #can not support to a Commission that the gives to be the government of *Europa, without that, by it other, citizens have approved never explicitly similar statute.
The crisis of confidence of citizens in the #european institutions that has revealed clearly abstention in the last elections demands no only "a modern and effective administration", but also new politics that answer positively to the problems *económicosociales that live in the countries members of the European Union.
disposal of the Council to modify proposals concerning the council administration, #can show to citizens #which is, in fact, reason of the Council and *cúanto detests to squander, since the realisation of reconstruction of *Kosovo will be in cases cheaper #if it takes from the region that #if it takes from States members.
To finish, will say that until it have not found a just and global solution to the problem of refugees, support of the Union to the *OOPS, like provider of state-owned services in *Cisjordania, *Gaza, the *Líbano, *Jordania and Syrian, is of vital importance to relieve the difficult situation of the 3,5 millions of Palestinians that live in the fields of refugees.
In effect, in moment in that the international community and #all the world-wide press highlight the importance of the scandal that produces in *Rusia, have to adopt initiatives to comprise the gravity of said scandal, how explanations gives the #russian Government to indictments and #which are, by the contrary, our reports on the community finances with *Rusia.
vision of the cost, the most tragic, is joined to the quantity of human lives that have lost, to families undone, to the psychological shock that have suffered #all the inhabitants of the regions affected by fear to a possible back earthquake.
Precisely in peace times among #Grecia and *Turquía have an opportunity of *acercar jointly here in the European Parliament to villages of countries and to surpass at last it that *me has tried *inculcar and probably also to *ellos in history books in school, to know, that the Greeks and Turkish hate reciprocally.
In these moments, the Commission, jointly with other integral of the international community, takes a call to the #russian authorities so that utilisation of strength was proportional to the fight in the territory of *Daguestán, #as well as to persecution operations through border *chechena.
The first question is until how point has been funded building entirely by *Francia and #if it has been really gift of the #french government because my constituents want to have security that taxes, is to say taxes #dutch, have not come to stop here.
Recognise the importance of a debate in Parliament on the alimentary security, but the proposal presented was in favour to celebrate a debate with character of urgency on the question of #if a Been member has right to decide by himself\/hisself same of compliance no with the community politics, but with it that suits to his own political interests in moment given.
But had account of the free market, of the open borders and of the practically boundless import, especially #if it proceeds of third countries, is indispensable that impose a series of community norms properly controlled in matter of security and environment, no only inside the European Union, but also in the countries of origin of foods.
The problem sharpens even more by liberalisation of the market, #whose result is the circulation of products no subjected practically to control, #as well as by competition without limits, that offers to the monopolies the *coartada for resource even to irregular methods of reduction of costs and increase of benefits, and by nonexistence of an effective control of the quality, that remains at the expense of the own consumers.
In this context, of course calls attention that, in relation with the subject of identification, States members, but also the Commission, consider the possibility to postpone identification of livestock *vacuno and labeling of meat until after 1 January of the 2000.
Therefore, *yo #would ask to his *Señorías that do not include this reference on the modification of the financial perspectives having, very understood, two things: first, that, obviously, anyway the Commission goes to pose a modification of the financial perspectives in the future in the that will take into account no only element but elements linked to the subject of *Kosovo.
know also difficulties that hinder penetration of energies in a liberal market in the that the energetic resources more traditional are with frequency to a lower price, without forgetting the fault of measures oriented to promote of way *voluntarista the new energies.
The community program *SAVE for efficiency and saving energetic constitutes #one of the key elements of the strategy of the European Community in favour of an effective energetic consumption or, it that it is it same, a reduction of CO2 broadcasts.
It that is in *entredicho is respect of a fundamental principle of our own survival in the future, that is the of denominations of origin of our genuine products, protected, by it other, by the World-wide Organisation of Trade to the protect of the rights of intellectual property.
By means of the agreements of *Wye *River and of *Sharm the-*Sheik, the new political situation in #Israel, a direction of the *OLP decided and a deeper consciousness in the #arab world, has created a new situation that favours a real and sustainable solution of agreement to the interests of the region.
The new #israeli Prime minister, Mr. #Barak, has formed a Government with a majority it sufficiently wide as for *permitirle restart negotiations in the peace process with the necessary parliamentary backrest to his declared intention to go back to promote the peace process.
The #european contribution to peace in Orient Next do not manifests only through the economic and financial help, also consists in following being categorical with regard to the political principles of a just and durable arrangement, in #whose definite solution will finish for leaving a #european print.
On the other hand, results particularly grave that #can separate agreement of the global negotiations of the general agreement, it that #would cause postponement, with damages of *ello resultant, and #would seat bad precedents from sight point of defence of denominations of community origin in the *OMC, in particular regarding denomination "Port".
Exists point, without embargo, on the that wish to call attention so much of Parliament as of the Council and of the Commission: treats of the influence that #can exert liberalisation of exchanges, even by a period of ten years, in the economic development of the regions *ultraperiféricas, and in particular of The Meeting, #european territory of full exercise situated near of *Sudáfrica.
This exception to the international regulation, inscribed of irresponsible way in an agreement that links to the European Union, constitutes a dangerous precedent, able to generalise to States, specifically to the new producing countries of wines (*América Latin, *Oceanía, #etcetera), #if like this they request it to the European Union.
To the deny to put end to immigration in *Europa, when denying to *controlarla seriously, when denying to impose a systematic detection of AIDS in the possible immigrants that proceed of these countries of *África, will expose to Europeans no only to the *seropositividad, but also to illnesses opportunist, like tuberculosis, that had been eradicated of our continent.
This Round of #Millenium do not has to determine the defensive attitude in front of the North American position in imports to the European Union of agricultural products treaties with genetic engineering but that the European Union #would have to find partners for his global dynamic strategy.
*Segunda, #can confirm Mr. *Sasi that the Presidency will present new proposals to facilitate the most complete provision possible to the European Parliament of the documents negotiated in the Committee 133 of the Council, accompanied, in case, of the special procedures of face to protect confidentiality?
do not leaves to be odd that the Commission of *Bruselas, in moment in that it asks to States members that give green light to go back to initiate, leaving sideways all it other, a new cycle of commercial negotiations *multilaterales, do not seats the need to take a balance *mínimamente objective of the *OMC, and especially of solution device of *litigios.
Obviously, have to defend values and the principles that are fundamental for the countries of the Community, without embargo, have to take it of wise and flexible form having always in account that before that at all it is the need to carry forward this fundamental strategic interest for liberalisation of the international trade to the that *me finish to refer.
Want to avert that they contemplate *diferenciadamente the classical services of the new -transfer mood do not changes at all nature of service- and a better access to the market of third States for commodities and services, included telecommunication services based in the electronic commercial traffic.
Subject: structural Bottoms The corresponding sums to the structural Bottoms allocated to the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *n1 1 no the delivers the #spanish State in accordance with objective criteria of population and of income by inhabitant, with it that applies politics that do not seems to respect the own goals of the #european Bottoms.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, want to say that, regarding the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *nº 1, the #spanish State, in spite of competitions of the Autonomous Communities, reserves for politics centralised, no applied in general in the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *nº 1, the 55% of bottoms that get to the #spanish State.
Second, only wanted to that *usted confirm #if the Council, against of the will of #one of States members, #can increase this quantity so that country #would have to pay more, is to say, that *le #would force to deposit a greater part of currency reservation in the Central Bank and that there #be not a maximum limit.
The European Union reaffirms in disposal to support and boost renewal process in *Argelia, especially inside the frame collaboration *euromediterránea, that involves, among actions, the immediate resumption of negotiations on the Association Treaty of the Countries *Euromediterráneos.
According to article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union, the Union assent in a series of common principles of States members, principles on freedom, democracy, respect to the human rights and to the fundamental freedoms, in addition to the principle of the legality.
Gentleman President, in the first place, have been able to observe personally that the majority of the most important airports follow having big activity in spite of the suppression of the free sales of taxes. And as I indicated in my previous answer, consider that it is function of each Been member take charge of the consequences and problems, loss of employments in his majority, that the suppression of these free sales of taxes #can involve.
Moratorium for death pity - *B5-0144\/1999 of Mr. *Thors, #among others, in name of the Group *ELDR, on the vote of a resolution by the General Assembly of Nations Joined on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of penalties capital;
Therefore, ask to the Council that do not block with philosophical debates, but that procure that this text contain the mechanisms that *nos allow to continue said battle and that #can, it before possible, conclude the editorial to begin, in the Council and in the Commission -Mr. *Patten *nos has ensured it-, the task to convince to the 180 States members of Nations Joined.
As #all know, the European Parliament already showed sensitivity in this subject *cuando, takes so only months adopted a decision, collected by Mr. *Napolitano in the text of report, that includes articles very concrete on how have to work and #which are points that have to take in consideration so that the goal of the fight against fraud convert in reality.
To time, #would be omission on my part not mentioning in this moment the big worry and, #if they want to, the contribution of the Commission of Budgetary Control of the European Parliament, that through an opinion, included also in the report of Mr. *Napolitano, established really bases very solid.
#Can *asegurarles that the Commission is fully conscious of #which is paper that plays the fight against fraud in the assessment of the #european politics to the eyes of citizens and of citizens and thus I celebrate once again in name of the Commission the report and work that has made.
Are conscious of rapidity with that is this system and that Internet world, is to say, the world of users of society of information, is very advanced in it *concerniente to the validity of agreements and transactions to *través of the electronic system.
And #if, as I estimate, erosion of the principle of the country of origin looms fundamentally to the only market of electronic services in *Europa -which, to time, #would constitute an important example for the operation of the electronic trade in our globe-, then the results #would be *tristísimos and *dañosísimos for citizens of *Europa.
The project of proposal is linked directly to the technical requirements of Norm 34 of the Economic Commission for *Europa of Nations Joined, that treats of prevention of the risk of fire and in particular of disposals applicable to fuel deposits manufactured with plastic.
Have to leave that States members and the Commission take proposals and afterwards have to *ocuparnos of #some of the essential initiatives and expose sight point of citizens, companies, users of road and drivers in #all the European Union.
In the European Union have to *preocuparnos by #all looks of security in #all transport forms, no only vehicles of two tyres, or vehicles of four tyres, or the railways, or aircraft, or fuselages or it that it was, but also in relation with the *telecabinas and transport facilities by wire.
*Yo add, besides, that will be precise to include in the Budget 2000 15 millions of euros corresponding to the contribution of the European Union to condonation initiative of debt of the poorest countries that, as #such, has to fund directly with charge to the Budget, or was, no with pertinent resources of Development Bottom.
Our commission considers also that it has to constitute a priority for the Union the provision of statistical informations of high quality, especially now that the Economic and Monetary Union has applied in the zone of the euro and have already the perspectives of enlargement of the Union.
Even so, consider particularly important that have not accepted the linear reduction introduced by the Council and, especially, that foresee a moderate increase in the field of the veterinary and phytosanitary costs, to the equal that in the field of support to commercialisation.
Gentleman President, budget project for the year 2000, 92 *millardos of euros, a *margen of flexibility for Parliament of 1,5 *millardos of euros had account of it that they are the financial perspectives, linear reductions of #all credits, or, anyway, agricultural credits, #few ambitions, always the *espolvoreamiento and the *clientelismo budgetary: is to say, budget project without great novelties, and gentleman *Bourlanges has the big merit to try encourage technically the debate.
The solution of the paradox *nos has been suggested and consists in not accepting that morning priorities are funded with sacrifice and the priorities of today and of yesterday and, in consequence, in funding the new and *irrenunciables priorities of the external actions with a review to the heaves of the financial perspectives of category 4.
Two final observations: the first is difficulty to understand and, therefore, to explain, why has, as it has to be, of a juridical foundation to support to the victims of natural catastrophes in place of the world, as with justice go to take for *Turquía, and do not has of said foundation bear inside the Union.
The Treaty by the that it establishes the European Community contains varied disposals allocated to guarantee the democratic responsibility of #ECB, #one of #whose angular stones is definitely the presentation of the Annual Report to the European Parliament and to the Council of the European Union.
To normality has contributed, definitely, the fine direction and management of the Central Bank European, and to *él and especially to President it is necessary *felicitarlos due to the fact that, in the first months of the establishment of the euro, *cuando fixed the first orientations, had to surpass -and took it with tarpaulin- #some adverse circumstances in some certainly delicate moments to level so much internal like international.
To mood to see, #this contradicts article 113 of the Treaty of the EU, that establishes the obligation of #ECB to present an annual report to Parliament on activity and on the economic and monetary politics.
These gentlemen of the Central Bank European comport like spokesmen of the big *patronal that is, in effect, "reducing the rigidities of the market of work" , destroying thousands of employments as in this moment in *Michelin, *Renault-*Nissan, *Alsthom, *Rhône-*Poulenc and *Hoest #Marion *Roussel and #a lot of #others, or generalising precariousness with wages that sink to an increasing part of the population in poverty while it increases fortune of the great shareholders.
do not has power to fix types of interest, power on the types of change, little can on the public cost, restricted by the Stability Pact, and #if it was in hand of #many of members of Parliament, power on the own fiscal types.
The union of the two wallets of development and humanitarian help increases the possibilities to reach this goal, especially #if we take into account the fact that so much work field of THROW like the field of competition of the responsible commissioner of development politics are global.
Regarding actions in matter of fight against drug for the period 2000-2004, the Council now *nos urges to approve to haste this document whereas, as it admits the own Commission, has not taken any systematic and rigorous assessment of the presumptive results of the previous plan.
Has talked to open" the Council to the public scrutiny and to study reforms, and has expressed hope that the Presidency #finnish leave a durable print in the Union in this sense.
Nevertheless and said was of step, is true that the special situations demand a special effort -and was necessary a special bottom to cover this special effort- so that they are not projects already in course the that they go to pay the special situations, as it seems that it exists now the risk that it was *África the that go to pay efforts that the *EU will take in *Kosovo.
To time, want to ask to the Presidency of the Council that, of compliance with the document of the Commission, in the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental open the possibility to present an own proposal to apply of a reasonable mood work methods.
#All actions and other more that affect to security of citizens of the European Union, have to be undertaken on the base of the full respect of the fundamental rights of #that that live in the territory of the Union, because the key of the future space of freedom and security are precisely the fundamental rights *irrenunciables.
Gentleman President, for the very cold and rational heads the year 2000 is of course a year like #another #any one, but no only the no romantic #can embezzle to the start of a new century to #one magic, to elevate head above his own activities and adopt in front of his own future *algo #as well as project attitude.
This Council of Wise persons do not devotes neither a critical word to the second and *tercer *pilar of this democratic non-existent country of cooperation among the Governments neither neither makes any proposal to link it to a #european democratic reform.
In my opinion, when developing reference frame #european for utilisation of the digital signature, the European Union always has to act also to international level so that the legal guidelines of the system are ratified.
By #this a concrete principle to justify intervention of the Union in this matter is the of the possible social insecurity that #can produce company restructurings inside the Community and, was as it was, inside States members, a principle that, on the other hand, already was foreseen in the Treaty of Blunt of 1957.
Gentleman President, when refusing prohibition Treaty of nuclear proofs, the American Senate has taken an irresponsible gesture assuming to time responsibility to put to the world in front of the serious danger of the nuclear holocaust.
strengths are #the same that follow *perpetrando death pity and not paying quotas owed to Nations Joined contributing of way to the loss of legitimacy and functionality of organism that has like constitutive element the right of villages to rid of wars.
This attitude of the Senate of the #EE.UU is in contradiction with the final statement of the *CTBT that, as *usted gentleman President of the Council has mentioned, has gathered in *Viena of the 6 to 8 October underlining the importance of a global and verifiable prohibition of the nuclear essays and urging to #all States to sign and ratify with rapidity said Treaty.
But perhaps #can go a bit more far and affirm that it really hurtful for the European Union #would be #if, after having reaffirmed the cause in favour of an external politics and of common security, after having defended the cause of an initiative by security and defence, *nos remained short in it that take regarding rhetoric.
Of Compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0026\/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of Council (13328\/2\/1998 - *C5-0023\/1999 - 1998\/0169(*COD)) with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes an only instrument of finance and of programming of the cultural cooperation (Program "Culture 2000" ) (Speaker: Mr. *Graça *Moura).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0024\/1999) of Mr. *Gargani, in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on decision proposal of the Council (*COM(1999) 111 - *C5-0019\/1999 - 1999\/0066(*CNS)) relative to the community participation in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector.
Was constituted in the month of October of 1989, under the auspice of program *Eureka Audiovisual, acts in the frame of a partial agreement reached in breast of the Council of *Europa and among members has 34 #european members and the Commission of the Union *Europa in group.
To personal title, without embargo, want to say that the third amendment did not have my approval, in the sense that, in the text *originario, the decision that #be to approve and that the Commission already has anticipated, had to expire the last day of the last month of the *quinto year, while the Commission has reduced this term to three years.
Without wanting to question the authority of president of the commission that finishes to take part and to sight of appeal of the greater parliamentary Group, meeting wiser act with greater prudence because, as it has shown, no fits doubt that the necessary absolute majority converts, at least, in difficult the vote.
Expect of the capacity of gentleman Commissioner, of attitude of the Commission, of our Council and of Governments, that conclude *felizmente an agreement that allow, on the one hand, continue with activity *pesquera and, by the #another, why no, that *Marruecos and citizens #moroccan benefit of privilege that have when administering waters that have bank *pesquero so important.
The European Parliament, in the amendments that presents Fishing Commission, asks to the Commission that follow the subject, that inform to Parliament and to the Council, at least three months before the expiration of the agreement, so as to have security of continuation.
In this moment, since it has modified the juridical foundation -and east is reason of the new regulation- and the procedure that has to apply no longer is the of article 37, or was, the of query, but the of article 152, or was, the of *codecisión, Parliament has the duty and responsibility to reduce term of the 2003.
A technical analysis allows to get to the conclusion that the *desaceleración of growth tendency in the European Union explains by a combination of external crashes, amplified by divergences of the national politics, in a context of structural rigidity.
The unification of coins has induced the unification of the financial politics; the of the financial politics, the unification of the economic politics; the of the economic politics, the unification of the social politics.
The Presidency #finnish also pleads by transparency in this subject, although game point was confidentiality; #this, to time, is owed in big part to that each *dialogante talks of his own subjects and of his specific field without pretending get to common agreements, but that it that looks for is the mutual understanding.
In the marine sector, with the amendment *nº 6 have examined the question by extensive and in depth to try give with a formulation that guarantee the achievement of a collective agreement that offer the maximum flexibility allowed by the directive, is to say, the annual computation of the labour day.
Parliament had asked that it take into account that the air conditioned or another additional squad #can increase pollution. That the juridical responsibility of manufacturer and of distributors has to delimit of form more precise and that, therefore, included director cars and vehicles with permission of circulation of day.
The collateral effects and adaptation of actions will base in his greater part in the frame of the inner market that the Commission formulates two times to the year and in the report of *Cardiff on the operation of product markets and capitals.
As half against unemployment the report mentions also the increase of adaptation capacity of companies and to this *respecto is precise to ensure, for example, through minimum standards, the participation of workers, information and query of #the same in the timely time and, with #this, possibility to adapt to change.
project of the *UEM creates unemployment, and regarding the active labour politics is obvious that #this presupposes local and national initiatives by reason that the labour markets of the community countries are organised of form so distinct among himself\/hisself that results of the all impossible put in practical any #another measure that are not the normal measures and no *vinculantes included in the existent proposals.
*Yo expect proposed like #this of the new Commission, knowing, gentleman President, that in moment will find the social object of the Union, is to say, a greater social wealth and employment no based in partial measures but in an economic development and in some fully profitable and reliable companies.
The high taxes, the social redistribution of income and politics *salarial *inflexible #be to conduct to societies to a situation degraded, in the that work no longer is for individual a stimulating alternative from the point of economic sight.
Like this and #everything, in the *mundialización of the markets, *Europa runs the risk of suffering competition of the great economies that invested and invest more in diffusion of technologies and in investigation, #as well as in the professional training of youngsters, #this is, in the future of the most advanced industries technologically.
Report (To5-0049\/1999) of Mr. *Gahrton, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the Council by the that celebrates the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technical among the European Community and the Popular Republic of Chinese (*COM(1999) 287 - *C5-0038\/1999 - 1999\/0123(*CNS))
Report (To5-0047\/1999) of Mr. *Linkohr, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the Council by the that celebrates the Agreement of cooperation scientific and technological among the European Community and the Argentinian Republic (*COM(1999) 292 - *C5-0040\/1999 - 1999\/0125(*CNS))
Lady Speaker, believe that the proposal that has taken the Table is the best solution in this case, is to say, that the debate on *Chechenia celebrate of the 15.00 to the 16.00 hours because like this, in place to interrupt the debate on the conference *intergubernamental, will begin the session of the afternoon on said conference hour later, believe that, of way, will be able to debate the two subjects more correctly.
To continuation, have the proposal of Mr. Baron *Crespo to suppress question hour to the Council, proposal varied by Mr. *Leinen, that asks that question hour celebrate during the nocturnal session, after the institutional debate, it that *me seems to coincide with the criterion of Mr. Baron *Crespo.
Lady Speaker, Parliament already has voted a resolution to the *respecto, but today poses a problem: the World-wide Bank has to pronounce *próximamente on the relevance of project, and think that, given the projection that has on villages of #Chad and of *Camerún, #would be very received a message of the European Parliament.
The first proposed of the Commission is of May of 1998, and in the last 18 months the procedure survived no only to a change of legal base, but also to change of the Treaty, to change of *comitología, to change of Parliament and to change of the Commission.
With that have seen the apparition of criminal organisations devoted to the sale of boys, mothers to the that *les steal children, mothers to the that bribe so that they separate of children, mothers to the that *engatusan *diciéndoles that boy goes to enjoy of a good beginning in life and afterwards return with family, *cuando, of course, no exists this intention.
The question that, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, want to take to lady Commissioner that, on the other hand, has shown sensitivity to these subjects, is the following: *Nos #can say #which are looks conflictive of the question and reasons by the *cuales has not presented a proposal reviewed still?
Likewise, #if we decide to transfer competition, put by case, of cooperation for development of States members to the European Union, believe that we #can reach *muchísimo more in the world with quantity of money and #can increase resources without thus increase the fiscal charge that *recae on citizens of the European Union.
But it that still lacking and it that still has not reached the ancient Commission and that expect reach at last, is a #european directive in the that no only regulate technically feeding of current *proveniente of sources of renewable energy but also that, in accordance with the right of #european competition, specify moods on how #can boost *contractualmente in the Community current produced in this way.
Exists coincidence in considering that energy conservation, the rational planning and the renewable energies constitute the most important form, apart from tax to CO2, on the that, as I already have said, has not got still to an agreement.
*Me go to refer now to part *jocosa of the subject: the *UJD, the #slovakian authority supervisor of the nuclear facilities, did not concedes already from 1995 the usual permission of service for varied years but only a provisional extension of a year with the purpose to force to the *explotadores to make the necessary modernisations.
Gentleman High Representative, no fits doubt that the institution of charge and in particular nomination has created great expectations in this sector of the public opinion - that create majority - that thinks that *Europa has to endow of an external politics and of common security #if it wants to, as *usted has said, be credible further of the commercial exchanges or of the economic gigantism.
Surely will coincide Mr. #Solana *conmigo #if *le say that the dip that *nos have traced those who today have #any greater or lower responsibility in the process of #european integration #would take *palidecer the most optimistic ambitions of the #european leaders of *cuando, for example, *usted chaired the Council of General Subjects of the European Community.
The goal of the debate of today is *clarificar and evaluate, from sight point of the European Union, the global approach of negotiations to scale world-wide and situate it in the political context of a global strategy.
The increasing tendency to company fusion that develop activities of transnational character and impotence of the national States in front of monopoly constitution, oligopolies and cartels put in danger the goal of the world-wide trade to contribute to the welfare and peace all over the world.
Besides, also is particularly important that have clear that the *aminoración of growth of the world-wide economy also saves relation with unsteadiness of the international financial system, that characterises by enormous and swift financial transactions to scale world-wide and, although it has *desgajado of the world-wide economy, without embargo *repercute on investments, growth and employment.
Second, that fix rules of common game to #all with respect of the matters at present no treated or insufficiently treated by the Agreement of *Marraquech, examples of the *cuales are modalities hygienic-sanitary, the environmental effects and of health of methods of intensive production or respect of sensitivity of consumers.
#This is particularly important, since #many of the subjects, especially the new -colleagues have signalled it already- have a strong emotional charge, as, for example, the question of links of investments to a new regulation of competition and to the social and labour norms, but also #many #others.
But is in haste of the that gives proof and to the that the report *Schwaiger takes reference with obstinacy #where reside reasons to raise legitimate suspicions, especially #if it wants to remember that these same principles finish to see ridiculed in the recent files of banana, of the *OGM and meats of *vacuno with hormones, in the *cuales the defeat of the European Union through the Commission is so discreet like fast.
*Rusia -and #this results particularly painful for the #european left- did not constitutes an exception in this sense, but that acts, to mood to see, exactly the same that it took it NATO in *Yugoslavia and *me seems opportunism of the worst class that those who have applauded to Mr. #Solana to first hour, applaud now intervention of Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit.
will Have reached, in the final act, quotation on the principle of caution, in look sanitary, even in the phytosanitary, a forum *OIT-*OMC, recognition of the environmental principles, in measure that have been already recognised in *Kioto.
In these decades, in these last *lustros, the international trade -*Europa is the homeland of #David #Ricardo- has allowed, thanks to a new international division of work, generate wealth and inclusion, #as well as win poverty that, with the increase of the population and without the international trade, #would be much graver that the current.
education, health, the public and social services, the public transports, culture , are #others *tantos sectors that #can not put in scales of a commercial negotiation and #can not depend of a court of international trade.
But the next cycle of negotiations has to tackle also new subjects: development, the environment, health and the sanitary security, the fundamental social norms, competition and transparency of some minimum rules in matter of investments and the promotion of the cultural diversity.
Has got hour, without embargo, to be able to send parliamentary representatives to #all the meetings and to take part in the *CIG, in quality of community institution, in equality of conditions that the Commission to defend our positions and our proposals and, in case, *rebatir the proposals that present #others.
The Commission, with orientation power, the new authority, recognised to President, #would have to preserve -will not be easy, *permítanme say it, now that am inside the Commission- his school character, efficiency, form of decision by simple majority of members that the compose.
Takes lacking to integrate, for example, functions of the Western European Union in the Union to avert new *Kosovos, but also boost coordination of the economic politics, the fiscal harmonisation and the creation of an authentic *Europa social and of employment that *nos allow to confront worries of citizens.
lack self-evident with special virulence in the point of intersection among the Economic Union and the Monetary Union, by part, and in the point of intersection among the Political Union and the Economic and Monetary Union, by #another.
Like this *me allow *recordarle #one of looks that with tarpaulin has stood out Mr. *von *Boetticher, to know, the package of proposals also has to foresee that in the general and essential part of the Treaties establish a frame that define clearly competitions of the European Union.
In this context, the Council wishes to remember the conclusions that issued on 25 May 1994 related with the nuclear security in electricity production of the countries of *Europa Central and of the East, #as well as in new independent states, in the *cuales the Council expressed posture in front of this question.
All citizen of the Union, #as well as person physical or juridical that reside or have domicile social in a Been member, will have right to access to the documents of the European Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission, with arrangement to the principles and conditions that will establish of compliance with sections 2 and 3.
The Council, with arrangement to the planned procedure in the articulate 251, will determine the general principles and the limits, by reasons of public or private interest, that regulate the exercise of this right of access to the documents, in term of two years from the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, only want *indicarle and *asegurarle to Mr. deputy to Parliament that the Council is perfectly conscious of the need to simplify and take more effective finance mechanism of the Countries and Territories of *Ultramar, but, as I already have said, by moment *nos has sent only communiqué, in the that they present three possible models of performance.
#If it is not possible to vote on the report today, it better #would be that we asked to services of Parliament #if it is not possible to sustain this debate today in the afternoon and vote Wednesday of the partial period of sessions of December, it that *nos #would allow to communicate the results to the Council before Thursday; #can ask also to Commissioner that took part about the Council in relation with this question?
Thus, in my opinion #would have been preferable to resort to the original proposal of the Commission of Budgetary Control contained in his opinion directed to the Commission for Constitutional Subjects, in the that excludes #all this group of questions and only regulate the rights and obligations of deputies.
Also there #be a concrete reference in the preamble to the Protocol on privileges and immunities, and a reference to the fact that the pertinent article #can not go in detriment of confidentiality requirements that #can fix concerning deputies of the European Parliament.
Now well, although it was necessary to expect to that it finalise negotiation cycle, to be able to express trial on bottom in relation with the results obtained, it true is that, regarding the frame, the global result #can not consider totally negative #if the #european nations #can obtain regulation more *vinculante of the international norms in matter of competition.
Regarding point 27, think that it has been a big advance that the called tasks *Petersberg of Colony document (humanitarian actions and of rescue, actions for the maintenance of peace and actions armed in relation with the handle of the crisis, included measures for the maintenance of peace) incorporate to the own tasks of the EU.
The fact to demand today the immediate and unconditional abolition of death pity in the whole world, means no only promote the human dignity, but also give a sense to the Universal Statement of the Human Rights.
By the contrary, death pity is weapon preferred by the totalitarian diets because it constitutes a symbol of power of state and of humiliation of individual in front of the state power; and know, besides, that is used to annihilate to opponents.
Thus, think that #if the European Union did not condemns and puts remedy to this criminal behaviour, the conclusions #would be obvious: in the first place, the European Union #would convert in accomplice of slaughterings of #serbian and #gipsy organised by the criminal bands and *mafiosas of the *UCK; second, #would show that there #be two *varas to measure in Occident; and in *tercer place, #would say that the goal of intervention was to destroy to village #serbian.
Finally -besides, of course, to loan a very special attention to the *TPI bear *Rwanda-, so that it do not forget this conflict, that already seems very far, too much far for #some, paper of the European Union consists, in my opinion, in being present beside village #rwandan in occasion.
Although it was not very revolutionary and although the step forward was too much small, have hope that it allow to compare *bad *practices splitting of some reliable data and that feels the bases for politics of drugs human and effective in the frame of a European Union integrated.
Our problem in actuality is the existence of youngsters #whose life in family is fine but that to time feel that existence is so empty that need tablet or a *tripi Saturdays in discotheque and like this reach *entonarse with help of drug on the that *les has induced to think that it is *inofensiva.
Wanted to congratulate to Mrs. *Giannakou by his valuable report, and by the importance that concedes to the international cooperation and to the consolidation of the annual systematic meetings of the council *interinstitucional, for a better follow-up and assessment of actions, #whose main goal is to achieve decrease of substance offer *estupefacientes.
will not be able to forget never that time, *cuando was responsible minister of the fight against drug, went to visit to youngster that had lost health, friendships, relations, family, placing, perspectives and even respect of himself\/hisself same.
With his reduced expectations of payment of the interests of the owners of capital and like this his possibly reduced *gearing *rate, #this is relation among the volume of loans concerning the own capital around the 2,5 -*cuando the *ratios in the market usually surpass the 10- the bank enjoys of big confidence in capital markets.
The speaker and Budget Commission stand out especially that projects of the Bank have to support important goals, #among others, decisions of the European Parliament as, for example, in matters #such as the fight against poverty and the protection to democracy, to the human rights and to the environment.
As I have said before, gentleman President, the Commission of Juridical Subjects approved by unanimity the regulation, but proposes a series of amendments allocated to signal that article 299.2, that already is in vigour, establishes an additional base for regulation proposal of the Commission.
worry that this modification has caused in Canarians -and of the that *nosotros *nos take echo- has grown in measure in that it goes arising #one distrust regarding the capacity of the own Government of my country to comprise the true entity and gravity of this problem and regarding will to confront to #the same in the referred negotiation with the Commission.
The report suggests that States Members and the forums #FMI World-wide Bank take measured to verify #if conditions and suppositions under the that it has conceded to *Corea rescue package directed by #FMI have respected in whole in the case of dockyards.
In July of 1999, Transport Ministry and Communications of *Finlandia even notified to the Commission bonus program of interest conceded to the naval acquisitions, #whose goal was *fomentarlas acquisitions and fuselage repairs of respectful charge with the environment and insurances, essential in conditions of the north, #where have to displace among the ice.
The Union #can not hide the self-evident fact that together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will have to exert a paramount paper in terms of financial contributions and technical help to guarantee security of #all these nuclear reactors what before better.
effort for examining obvious questions relative to the human rights in the EU is very partial Why has discrimination by reason of race or of ethnic origin favour deal and, for example, discrimination of women and of homosexuals do not mentions or hardly takes?
And #this is the background of these relative proposals to bottom assignment during a period of three years enciphered in 15 millions of euros for the set up of the adoption of the *acervo normative community and the consolidation of the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía and in 135 millions of euros for development of the economically retarded regions of *Turquía, respectively.
Gentleman President, believe that it that proceeds in this case is to congratulate to Mr. *Morillon by the realisation of these reports, that has had to take in circumstances very difficult, with a big haste of time, and believe that it has taken creditor to recognition of #all: like this has seen *recompensando with the vote that has produced in the Commission of External Subjects.
Like the planned quantities for the year 1999 were not *presupuestadas, it #would be necessary to prolong -to *ello has referred today the speaker- the budgetary frame of program in a year, until the year 2002, and it #would be necessary to include credits of the year 1999 in project *rectificativo and supplementary.
The Union has to ensure that #all the countries candidates -included, of course, *Turquía- will respect the international treaties and the international right, will cooperate with the neighbouring countries by peace and will resolve his eventual differences respecting the international right and resorting to the international instances of justice, like the Court of The Have.
do not has felt to affirm that only *cuando *Turquía have given determined steps, perhaps *le will give an affirmative answer. The usual reaction of *Turquía is to retort that, to sight that *Europa do not fulfils promises, do not have a clear #european perspective and, therefore, #can not undertake the risky path of reforms.
The sustainable harmonisation, from sight point of the *Báltico, of the ecological needs, of a viable agriculture, of the industrial politics, of the use of zones *vacacionales and of enlargement supposes, obviously, a big challenge so much to administrative level, as to political level.
The incorporation of the #nordic and #mediterranean countries to the European Union has been the main reason that it pose update of this directive, at present in vigour, that regulates seed commercialisation and forest plants and that from 1975 had not been modified substantially.
#If well in these last months the evolution of value euro\/dollar has been *desfavorable for the euro, *ello no only obeys to the existent current difference among the North American and #european economies from sight point of the dynamism and of performance.
Like speaker, believe that it is just to recognise that the initial proposal of the Commission improved to a large extent the *OCM current, especially when reinforcing the fundamental paper that producer organisations have in commercialisation of products and to the *otorgarles more and better mechanisms for the correct operation and to exert fishing and a more responsible commercialisation.
This proposal on the common organisation of the market in the sector of products of fishing and of aquaculture *reviste a central importance for the politics of common fishing in the European Union.
will Signal to the Assembly that, in said agreement on the Union *aduanera, the European Union is the that has resulted benefited -and *sobradamente- by commitments subscribed, since the balance of the commercial scales among the European Union and *Turquía has duplicated in favour of the European Union, from the application of these agreements.
In *tercer place, in the next agricultural negotiations #would have to occupy a central place the *multifuncionalidad of the #european model of agriculture, in concrete, a greater development of the rural space, the production of agricultural products of quality, environment even in relation with article 20 of the agreements of the *OMC on agriculture.
Therefore, #ours main mission follows being political and no technical, to know, reopen the public cause in favour of a greater liberalisation of trade, no only in benefit of companies and the #european consumers, but especially because the open trade is the only viable solution on a long-term basis to struggle against poverty in the world in development.
the first was an obsessive reference to the substantial reduction of the internal supports to agriculture, without that had *mínimamente in account diversity of the productive structures of the different countries and neither an objective classification and *homogénea of the diverse types of subventions conceded to agriculture;
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Court of Accounts, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, utilisation of the fiscal resources with arrangement to clear political priorities, according to the principles of saving and of efficiency, are the goals that #would have to impose #all the that they have to see with a public budget. #Such is the goal that has imposed the new Commission.
For *nosotros, the European Parliament, the achievement of a #european consciousness, a #european identity, respect by the diversity of cultures, tongues, ideas and religions, is in group *indivisiblemente tied to politics of #european training aggressive.
Through soup and with help of program *SOCRATES, the result of this project was an increase of student motivation and personal, a greater sensitisation of his own surroundings, #as well as of places and a greater knowledge of technology of the communications.
Gentleman President, finishes to appear in the press and have checked it in Fishing Commission. treats of cod fishing in the Atlantic northeastern and, besides, of a bilateral agreement among *Rusia and Norwegian, two states that together with #others like the European Union, *Islandia and *Polonia are parts in equality of rights in the Commission for Fishing in the Atlantic Northeastern.
The present report on verification of *credenciales, therefore, refers to the results of the *quintas elections to Parliament celebrated of the 10 to 13 June past, and bases in the official communications of the distinct States members on the group of the electoral results, included the names of the possible substitutes and order of *prelación resultant of the vote.
Thus, the #spanish delegation of the Popular Party European estimates necessary to keep in Plenary the relative amendments to the *primer paragraph of section 2 of article 3 and to the last paragraph of article 21, in the that concretise the exceptions and conditions for the use of methyl bromide after 2006.
The limit of the 1% in ingredient -that as *nos has informed to me and to #others already is surpassed by supermarkets, #among others, like requirement for alimentary products- is besides limit that, as I have been able to know, #can fulfil it easily #any one that wish to avert that in label of the alimentary products appear the indication that they contain organisms genetically modified, owing to the adventitious pollution, that go *usted to know it that *eso means.
Expect that it recognise to the European Parliament the right of *dictamen satisfied on the modifications of the Treaties and follow supporting the proposals of *Dehaene, *Weizsäcker and *Simons, in the sense that it #would be hit to establish a fundamental Treaty and a Treaty expanded, so as to that citizens of *Europa #can know how field will be competent in each case and how will configure the European Union in the century *XXI.
Although *me seat satisfied, and with reason, by the fine qualities of direction of the Government of *Finlandia and because in the great groups of questions, or well have achieved great progresses, or well have resolved entirely subjects, is evident that the fine results of this period derive of the will of #all the Union to develop a #european common structure.
Go to take a review, a Conference *Intergubernamental time, without a community method, without paper for the Commission, with an insignificant paper for the European Parliament, without contact with the national Parliaments and, finally, without transparency neither responsibility in front of the civil society.
Gentleman President, am particularly satisfied, of course, with confirmation by the Council of the position already proposed by the relative Commission to that enlargement of the European Union was a process in the that #all the countries of *Europa Central, that have presented like candidates, are involved, without distinction, in accordance with his own merits.

In first reading, my Group pronounced against any reduction of credits assigned to ancient but always important priorities -and especially of credits allocated to cooperation and to development of the countries of the south- to fund these new costs: never has been a good sign of political creativity undress to #one to dress to #others.
Gentleman President, in the first reading of the budget, the European Parliament pronounced clearly in favour of a review of the Agreement *Interinstitucional, so as to can answer to the derivative obligations of fishing Agreement, of help to *Kosovo and to *Timor Oriental, and of support to the victims of the earthquake.
Also are steps in the correct direction the initiatives of the Commission on the action plans of the Community and the proposal that is about development of the system of waste trade and material *contaminantes inside the Community.
will Say simply that the conferences on the *recalentamiento of the planet are #all equal, because the question that #can *formularnos is: "how many catastrophes designated natural will have still that expect to take really in consideration the effects *nefastos of the *recalentamiento of the planet and, especially, consequences in the economic and social development of societies, here in *Europa, but also was, in the rest of the world?"
By it that *atañe to the participation of the European Parliament, have to recognise that from takes years the European Parliament has been no only locomotive of sensitisation, of the #european public opinion and international, but also locomotive of the decisions, is to say, has influenced in decisions of the Council and of the Commission.
Report (To5-0081\/1999) of Mr. *Valdivielso of *Cué, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on regulation proposal (*Euratom, *CE) of the relative Council to the granting of assistance to the New Independent States to *Mongolia in reform effort and economic recovery (*COM(1998)753 - *C5-0038\/1999 - 1998\/0368(*CNS))
The European Union, that had prepared very well for discussions and #whose position has been very coherent, has not yielded regarding the agenda that wished that it approved, to know: a wide agenda, that no limited only to the agricultural questions and to services, as they wanted States Joined.

The question of identification of meat products of bovine and certainty that they are reliable is so fundamental for divergence among *Francia and the European Union like worries by the *inocuidad that have warmed up in the two last years the Commission of Agriculture and the Environment Commission.
In effect, have to say that seldom I have seen a budgetary procedure of nature, in that up to now- and until this positive statement, that allows to close the agreement -*nos found still in front of two lists of possible votes: a list taken in accordance with the Council and a list established on the base of a fault in accordance with the Council.
In this context, receive with satisfaction the new proposals presented by my colleagues of the Socialist Group for the creation of a #european court for small claims, with the end to help to persons to face up to damages caused owed by clashes in breast of the EU.
Gentleman President, every time that hear to talk in Parliament of the deprivation of basic human rights, like the right to vote and the right to present to some elections, #would have to serve for *fortalecernos in determination in promoting and promote democracy in #all parts of the world.
employment of resources of the structural bottoms no spent in program period 1994-1999, by against, #can not take in consideration, since the available resources already have been assigned to determined measures, and besides, in this concrete case, in narrow collaboration with the competent #french authorities.
In this context, the Council believes that the task of the regional politics consists in developing #all the potentials to compensate disequilibriums and *atrasos structural and accelerate the economic and social transformation in the less favoured regions, included the islands.
Is evident that this report do not requires more comments by part of this Commission and even do not has to have more comments of *ella, but that it is rather a subject for the next President of a new Commission that definitely will take advantage of *gustosamente of so rich experience reflected in *él -experience of Mr. *Herman the one who, as have understood, with this report and political will in fact sacks of the European Parliament-.

The Commission is convinced that, with the institution of Defender of the #european Village, the #european citizenship has enriched considerably and that the fine administration of the #european Institutions, transparency and equity of operation are right fundamental of #all citizens of *Europa.
Therefore we agree with the excellent report of Mrs. Of #Esteban #Martín *cuando invites to #all the #european Institutions to sensitise even more, #if it fits, to citizens with #all the possible means on the possibilities that they have to take cost rights and, in particular, obviously, on the possibility to direct to Defender of Village.

With security, the paramount paper in this attempt has to have it the European Union that, in collaboration with the General Secretary and with the Security Council of Nations Joined, will proceed to the necessary actions that carry to solve the problem.
But intervention of NATO, decided to the *margen of Nations Joined and with unsuitable means for the goals declared to neutralise the #serbian military capacity to continue the called «ethnic cleansing» no only has not resolved the question, but that, besides, has aggravated #all the problems.
Regret, nevertheless, that have not posed a terrestrial presence European to time that the aerial offensive and that simultaneously have not programmed a humanitarian action of big *envergadura to receive the wave of refugees *desprovistos of resources, that launch to roads.
By the contrary, when proposing, in his considering *J, weaken and *marginar the notion of national sovereignty, that, in spite of #all imperfections, constitutes, with #everything, the fundamental regulatory principle of our international community, the resolution introduces factor #whose consequences will not be able to be but extremely *desestabilizadoras and *perturbadoras in the international life.

Or to this sector no *le remains more remedy that *resignarse to that it always will have price difference among corn of the world-wide market and corn of the EU by the simple reason that in the EU there #be corn deficit?
Lady Speaker, the Commission received to finals of January reason exhibition of the #italian authorities in the that collected the official position on the start of a procedure in relation with the subject *C-81\/97, published in the Official Diary of the European Communities of 18 February 1998.
*Eso was contradictory and Parliament saw forced to tackle this subject by means of censorship motion by separate of the Commission, with it that destroyed the direct links among denial of the approval of the management and the consequence of exit of the Commission.
From this situation president of the Commission of Budgetary Control asked on 15 January 1999 in this Assembly by commission of the commission that Regulation Commission cleared how is it that the Treaty foresees exactly or that neutralised this accumulation of no approvals of the management and of possible votes of distrust.
*Permítaseme say that, in spite of the unavoidable difficulties owed to the rule of unanimity, results *innegable that now -to instances of the Presidency #german and with support of Parliament- are advances in the application of the strategy against the harmful fiscal competition and have fixed varied goals for the European Council of *Helsinki.
Of mood have to say that the group of representation of the Popular Party European in the Commission of Budgetary Control has shown in moment support to the speaker, has presented battle and has reached the goal proposed.
*Permítaseme examine also bottom subject of the original report on the approval of the management in the exercise 1996: reform program, that President in functions *Santer took #his on 11 January in reform program of the Commission.
Exactly by reason have initiated an evaluation of the risks and already have of the provisional results of *ella, that, as have understood, derive in part of a new examination of bibliography published with arrangement to criteria established by appeal organ and in part of the provisional conclusions of #some of the seventeen new studies that have commissioned.
#If we had carried out an economic politics, #would have offered the references, orientations, guidelines, the future that #this *Europa had to follow economically and perhaps #would have been able to reduce in *algún point unemployment and *reconquistar of form confidence that citizens are to lose.
In definite, has not advanced at all in the improvement of conditions of the rural world, there are difficulties from sight point of the agricultural politics and there are difficulties, of course, by the fault of a #european politics of economic and social cohesion.
The hegemony, in this case specifically the hegemony of the market, also *me concerns in quality of economist and of defender of the market economy. In effect, in #ours *Europa have developed a model of social economy of market, that concerns especially by the reduction and prevention of unemployment.
The Report *Menrad proposes to restart the subject of employment politics #european -and in this sense results pertinent the recent intervention of Mr. *Berthu on the economic political situation-, anticipating to the adoption of the #european package in matter of employment that definitely will approve in Colony.
Said #this, create, to the equal that the speaker, that for now and from a point of technical sight, is important to take note of accounts of the budget of the corresponding European Community to the exercise 1996. Is necessary that continue the examination of accounts of exercises back.
#All the neighbouring countries, #all the bordering states, except the of *Milosevic, wish three things: wish the internal democracy and wish *garantizarla by means of the external security in the frame of NATO and to *través of the economic development in breast of the European Union.
will Accept then peace, based in a #russian mediation, that do not fulfil with the requirements proposed, that do not guarantee the limits and the territorial integrity of *Kosovo, that do not make possible a safe return of refugees and expelled of *Kosovo and that give to *Milosevic the possibility to appear as victorious in front of the #serbian?
do not have to, without embargo, hide the every time greater unrest of our public opinions by the intensive and systematic bombardment of a #european country and of capital, by the every time greater number of civil victims that cause daily bombardments.
Already is hour that the European Parliament take part to reestablish conditions of valid democracy in our western countries, because there #be still representatives and militants of the party of the opposition in prison and #some deputies have been deprived of the parliamentary immunity.
By #this, in spite of #all the fine arguments that have listened, alternative only #can be a political solution, but on the base of renunciation to the use of strength, of respect of the human rights and of the return of refugees.
Had to have claimed the right of *darnos a statute -#this had to have been the strategy- a statute with the and capital that comprised the incompatibilities, the prerogatives of deputy, #status of deputy and no our financial diet that it is an internal subject.
By part, Parliament approved this question already takes more of half year, by it that is justified in part criticism that here has exposed in the sense that Parliament has not had of the sufficient time to study the document of the Council.
But during the first six months invests weight of proof, *eso means, that believes that defect existed already in moment of delivery, #if the seller #can not show damage caused by customer or #if the type of product do not allows this possibility.
Gentleman President, share fully the words of Mr. President and *me #would enjoy to take advantage of occasion to appreciate to the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer and especially to the speaker, Mrs. *González *Álvarez, work that has carried out and the interest that has shown along the processing of this proposal.
The modifications contributed to the ancient procedure are three: the suppression of the designated negative version of the third reading, thanks to the *cual, #if it had not got to an agreement in conciliation, the Council #can follow advance and approve his own text for afterwards present it to Parliament *confrontándolo to refuse it by absolute majority in term of six weeks.
Want to congratulate also to Mr. *Manzella and to Mr. *Corbett, #as well as to the negotiators of the three institutions by the excellent work made and for having known to find balance point among a dynamic application of disposals and the obligation to respect fully the Treaty.
#If the Union and the Presidency gave value to these two files in the European Council to indicate road, to adopt a decision that was the of the Union in the coming months, #would have a firm commitment in two fields that, to trial, will be decisive of face to the *tercer #millenium.
responsibility by this *asoladora violence, by the civil victims, by the destruction of life foundations and the civil infrastructures in Serbian and by the use of arms forbidden, the have #all #that that now no reestablish the empire of the right and do not finalise war.
Wish to express my deep disappointment by it that *sucedió yesterday, *cuando my Group presented to group Presidents the possibility to try find a reasonable mood to advance, and that taking into account that the Council gathers tonight and tomorrow, took a more definite decision, but #some colleagues resorted to procedures of this Assembly to block said possibility.
But, *cuando in day of today refuses amendment 18, that said that *nosotros *nos showed had to take it necessary so that this statute went in in vigour to the start of the next term of office, remove masks and takes in day. In week adopts a new mood of repayment of costs of trip, purportedly based in real costs, *cuando conserves a global character.
Whereas a solid juridical base #would allow the put in practice of a true politics integrated in favour of the insular regions by half, mainly, of the Structural Bottoms, the Council and the Commission have decided thing, overlooking besides the recommendations of the European Parliament on this question.
With the firm position of Parliament, that has allowed that the Commission retreat to a position less *intransigente thanks to perseverance and to the tenacity of #some States members, commitment is satisfactory in the short term regarding the abandonment of the *cofinanciación, to descent of the agricultural prices guaranteed more moderated of it planned and to the «*statu *quo» of quotas.
To the separate of support politics to agriculture by means of prices, when compressing to nationalisation, *fragilizándose by a new increase of the direct helps to income, *Europa moves away increasingly of mission and of the principles founders of the agricultural common market.
On point, am in big part satisfied of commitment of *Berlín oriented to put in spot, #if it gets the case, line agricultural guideline to thread of the successive enlargements and on consideration, in the financial perspectives, of an adjust automatic annual to take into account inflation.
Said approval will consolidate months of efforts that Parliament has devoted to guarantee the best possible agreement for development balanced of our regions and growth of the economic and social cohesion of the European Union.
The agreements *interinstitucionales and his financial perspectives have been progress element in the Community and have allowed a peaceful development and ordered of the #european budgetary life #as well as the achievement of a big series of political goals.
Have defined on purpose the scope of bottom so that it #can answer to the evolution of the economy and of the labour market during the next seven years, always with seen to encourage and to take possible that a greater number of persons have an active participation in the labour market.
Among the #others important elements of the regulation modified include, first, a really new modality for investment of bottoms allocated to the *RTE in bottoms of capital of risk so as to have access to resources, that #can be very great, of finance on a long-term basis that insurance companies and pension bottoms put to disposal to fund public projects of infrastructure.
*Yo create, lady Commissioner, that has carried out a fine reform, positive, of the structural Bottoms, with concentration projects, of simplification and with a *partenariado effective by means of the contribution of the regional and local authorities, that #can reach an efficient development in the effective application of these structural Bottoms.
The Union supports besides #all the #tending initiatives to improve the operation of the program «oil by foods» and remits in this context especially to the proposals presented on 30 March 1999 by signpost of the Security Council of the UN on the humanitarian situation in the *Iraq.
Neither is acceptable that, to the contrary, by it other, of it that the European Parliament approved here in November of 1998, keep the *condicionalidad of Cohesion Bottom concerning the Stability Pact and that now, for example, the Commission of Regional Politics propose a favourable opinion to regulation proposal that has exactly #that *condicionalidad.
The results are not perfect, but, in spite of the budgetary insufficiencies, of timidity of reform of the *PAC and of injustices and disequilibriums that keeps, has averted, anyway, a grave crisis in the European Union and #can say that in the next years the European Union goes to advance with confidence and stability.
Without embargo, #would wish *rendir homage to Prime minister and to the *Viceprimer Minister of the Assembly of *Irlanda of the North by support that *me have loaned, and to the Council and to the Commission because I consider that we have reached a reasonable and positive agreement for *Irlanda of the North on a long-term basis, by it that am satisfied treats of commitment, but of commitment that is good for my region.
Nevertheless, have the impression of that it exists a real need to go back to orient, situate and consider the goals that have not been able to reach in the past, all *ello to guarantee no only a suitable cost of bottoms, but also to bequeath positive looks there #where has allocated #european money.
But yes wish to reiterate my request to the Commission so that now finally elaborate a directive on the social security, so that the Council #can not follow hiding behind the excuses that has used up to now, so that at last really debate a directive on the social security to level of the Council.
Regarding the amendments on the creation of a *vademécum and on the criteria for information provision to companies, especially to #SME, agree in that a simple statement in record of the Council is not a guarantee of sufficient follow-up.
Also want to appreciate to those who have cooperated in obstinacy along these years and -how no!- to #all members of the secretariat of the Commission *REX, that also have put obstinacy in these goals, and to #all #that that have believed that cooperation with *América Latin was a very interesting cooperation for *nosotros.
am not of course follower of politics *neoliberales, but the suppression of the commercial barriers is a reality and the entrance in vigour of the Agreement of Free Trade of the Atlantic North has increased the #mexican dependency of trade with States Joined.
*Me upset #news of *México in the sense that no *nos has offered #all the necessary information, that it has *marginado to the civil society, and that the interests of multinationals and the private capital have happened to occupy a too much predominant position.
Wanted to ask here to the Presidency of the Council how the #european institutions, and especially the #european deputies freely chosen, #can explain to citizens and citizens of *Europa that adopted a decision of characteristics without the participation of Parliament, without that Parliament was properly informed, without that it was consulted.
The Report #Orlando, approved airily the past Tuesday, without that not even it have celebrated a vote, is a reflection of the investiture speech of President *Prodi with the end to demand this #european politics with regard to cities.
This result is especially important for cities, since it reinforces and converts in more credible the action Plan for a sustainable city, presented by the Commission the past month of November in *Viena, and because it reinforces the instruments contained in the Goals 1 and 2 of the structural Bottoms in favour of cities.
From takes varied years, villages of the Union refuse every time with greater clarity politics *ultraliberales and damages that #this *ocasionan to employment, to income, to the diets of social protection and to the public services, to the environment and to ordination of the territory.
Afterwards, the fact that candidate President have to present his political orientations in front of the European Parliament -it that Mr. Roman *Prodi has designated precisely government «program»-, forces it to reach a majority in Parliament, on the that will support action.
Gentleman President, have to say, to the equal that my colleagues, that to guarantee the peace process, the Palestinians have accepted - showing in this way his fine will- postpone the date of the statement of the #palestinian State, that the Agreements of *Oslo had fixed for 4 May.
Gentleman President, believe that #all will recognise that the approval by the Conference of Blunt, on 18 July 1998, of the Statute of the International Penal Court Permanent represented progress in the international institutions and in the international juridical order of the human rights.
Believe that the European Union #would have to help to the Czech Republic to endow of system of energetic production, using soft «energies», but #would not have to release bottoms to build head office of the #soviet type *VVER 1000, that, in my opinion, presents risks.
In December of 1998, *nosotros kept amendments against the common position, and lo and behold that in January of 1999, the Council discovers that it is necessary to modify the Regulation 330\/91, *cuando the modification proposed by the Commission was on of the table from 2 June 1997 and *cuando in enclosure already had effected two readings.
Gentleman President, the Commission congratulates by the initiative of Parliament to support the adoption, to community level, of rule that allow to determine the juridical and economic effects derived of failure of companies that operate in breast of the inner market.
Proposal of regulation (*CECA, *CE, *EURATOM) of the Council by the that they insert the corresponding quantities to *Austria, *Finlandia and *Suecia in article 13 of the Annex *VII of the Statute of civil servants of the European Communities, relative to diets by mission inside the #european territory of States members of the European Union (*COM(99)0133 - *C4-0226\/99-99\/0076(*CNS))
agreed to fix greater compensations for the *cultivadores of industrial potatoes of the that the Commission had proposed, giving at the end prevail by the number of hectares, on condition that the number of hectares went reducing appropriately. In this way the decision in group #would have a neutral budget, in accordance with the original proposal of the Commission.
Believe that it has achieved to give a big step when inaugurating in front of pavilion of the EU or of exhibition of the EU square devoted to #Robert *Schuman. Believe that it also has been a common attainment #ours explain how importance has had precisely #Robert *Schuman for development of *Europa and how importance purchases this square that will remain for back uses.
The result of this confluence of negative elements is that to the textile employer European *le serves of little have proceeded -as it has proceeded- to important investments in high technology and ambitious restructurings for *modernizar company, have specialised in the quality, in style, in the design, in the #european mark.
In the first turn, in the *cual the election of President of Parliament did not have to the principle possibility that it produced, *nosotros had decided to present the candidature of Mrs. #Laura *González, to strengthen our specific presence in breast of the left.
Besides, the congratulate no only for being President, and sex President feminine, but also for being from takes varied years a big colleague, and *le wish a good work that *redunde in benefit of Parliament, of the internal reform, but especially of the Assembly and of *Europa, because I know his big personal adhesion to *Europa, to our common vision.
The second point is that to keep negotiation capacity of a *Europa expanded is indispensable that resolve to time and of exhaustive way before enlargement the three institutional questions that remained slopes in *Amsterdam: the size and composition of the Commission, the vote *ponderado in the Council and enlargement of vote procedure by majority.
*Me seems very important -for Group, anyway- that in reform of the institutions that goes to undertake concede a greater weight to the national democracies and to the national parliaments, in place to leave that *Europa follow sinking and moving away of citizens, when creating democracy that have called virtual.
Expect of Commissioners that board dialogue with deputies to the European Parliament in the earliest moment possible of adoption process of decisions, but especially expect that they respect the principles of transparency and subsidiariness and also democracies and traditions.
The last facts related with pollution of #some foods with dioxin in *Bélgica have caused a particularly grave situation, no longer only by the risks that involves for health of persons but also because it has weakened confidence in the *piensos, in production chain of foods and in control of the authorities.
Apart from the urgent measures already announced, services of the Commission are now, and east is the most general frame, in proposals for the improvement or, #if it is the case, hardening of disposals valid in the Community on alimentary products for animals and persons.
In relation with the meeting summit that *clausuró works of the Council under the Presidency #german, want to insist from a principle in the good work effected by this Presidency, in a dangerous international context and in doubt period» by part of the #european opinions.
In this case, as in *tantos #others, the facts are more *elocuentes that the words, and in it that to me concerns, and in it that concerns to President and to the Commission designated #this is a maximum and a reality that goes to *modelar the task *reformadora of the Commission from the principle, #if #that is the result of the vote of this Assembly Wednesday.
Reinforces enormously the fine intention of the Commission but really #would produce recommendations frankly *insustanciales for inspection procedures that #would not guarantee the achievement of improvements and provides action program detailed to ensure that the existent laws are applied inside a realistic calendar but adjusted.
The preparation for enlargement will not be an easy task and will not see facilitated #if Parliament and the Commission do not collaborate closely to guarantee that they take firm decisions on these subjects or study in a surroundings of understanding and with a common purpose.
there #be not doubt that #if in the decade that finishes this year, had prevailed sensitivity by the different realities of villages in the #european position with regard to the ancient *Yugoslavia, in place of *obsesionarnos with the concept of State, things had been very distinct and, definitely, no so disastrous.
Gentleman President, gentleman President designated of the Commission, *yo go to vote tomorrow in favour of his Commission, but before *me will take an analgesic for headache and surely will need a double dose, seen denouement and the results of audiences, of the that has gone out *airosa a Commission announced like excellent, but that has not had a brilliant performance.
Without embargo, the #belgian government has designated in person of Mr. *Busquin candidate to commissioner that during years has been president of #one *association give *malfaiteurs, malefactor association, of the Socialist Party *Valón, association that is a true model of scandals of *sobornos, finance with traffic of arms, fraud, political nominations, *malversación of public bottoms and #european subventions.
On the great files that have in front - negotiations on the World-wide Organisation of Trade, Conference *Intergubernamental, debates on the Mediterranean subject - President of the Commission has communicated likewise will to associate like actors able to adopt decisions to deputies of Parliament.
Gentleman *Prodi, agreement with gentleman *Poettering is signal of a new was, a possibility to achieve a totally new culture inside the Commission, precisely directed to recover confidence and the interest of part of citizens by #ours EU.
Parliament has to consider very seriously paper, especially after the scarce participation in the recent elections in States members - a clear sample of the *desinterés, and more probably of cynicism and disdain of citizens - our mission today is to answer to audition of Commissioners designated and to the question posed by President designated, Mr. *Prodi.
Ask that Commissioner School and *usted same, in quality of President of #the same, develop the ambition to promote integration of equality goals among men and women in the general politics, an ambition that translate in progresses and improvements *mensurables.
The new Commission only will go in in functions time that have approved tomorrow election in quality of Parliament and after Commissioners and Commissioners have sworn charges in front of the Court of Justice European Thursday to the 12.00 hours, in *Luxemburgo.
do not mix this debate with morning debate on the budgets *rectificativos and supplementary 1, 3 and 4 for 1999, because *cuando President in exercise affirms that this spirit of cooperation is based in the mutual confidence (*eso is it that have written) among the institutions, do not have more that remember to the Council it that took with the budgets *rectificativos and supplementary 1 and 3 and #which was #ours reaction.
The principles of clarity, transparency and of *rectitud ethical have to chair the taking of decisions in breast of the Union, so much in the looks of administrative culture intern as in referents to guarantee security and the rights of citizens.
The proposal do not includes reference to these central solutions and has like only object promote the federalistic development of the European Union, development that the majority of the population of my country, *Dinamarca, refused in the referendum on the Treaty of *Amsterdam celebrated in 1993.
#If really they wish to create a democratic space of security, freedom and justice have to guarantee that the European Parliament convert in legislator with equality of rights in #all those fields in that they already have taken the decision -although of form certainly *titubeante- of *conferirle competition in a future no very far. Of it contrary, run the danger that the European Union *distancie even more of citizens.
#There is point of the resolution proposal by the that seat big charm and is point *séptimo *b in the that it censors the fact that the texts of the decision in matter of cooperation *Schengen still have not been given to know, although #this have happened to form part of the community right from May of this year.
But it more important of Colony proposal is method. In place to leave these questions in hands of the national Governments pretends to create a species of assembly in the that have representation the national Parliaments, the European Parliament and the Governments.
More that of the Letter of the fundamental rights treats of implantation of a new procedure of collaboration among the national Parliaments, the national Governments and the European Parliament that it #can award to the European Union the big *legitimación that *le allow to put final point to task.
Finally, #ours *Europa has to *proscribir form of discrimination in employment, house and access to leisure and remember to #all those that deny the existence of gas houses and that believe that races are uneven that racism is not an opinion, but offence.
means that #would have to use , in my opinion, lady Speaker, are three: the police cooperation -having very in account progresses that have achieved through *Schengen-, prevention of crime and the external relations, since security in the Union #can not isolate of the of the rest of *Europa neither of the world.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen deputies of the European Parliament, the European Union has supported, already from the principle of conflict, the attempts of *Portugal and Indonesian to get to a solution for *Timor Oriental that was accepted by the international community, endorsed by the UN and that was based in self-determination of citizens.
The organisation armed ETA has established #alto fire and the majority of the political parties, unions and #basque civil organisations have signed an agreement in *Lizarra-*Estella (*Navarra) that pretends *reconducir the #basque conflict by roads of dialogue and negotiation.
In *ella appears point *b) that tackles, in my opinion, subjection point essential of the #european institutional architecture: the right of initiative of the Commission, that has to act *colegialmente and be the only that have the right to propose #european legislation.
In my opinion, of it that treats especially is to recover a credible speaker, put end to a situation of interminable transition and allow to the #european executive restart his difficult task and advance at last, in narrow *concertación with the #european deputies, in relation with the questions determinants that affect to *Europa and to citizens.
*Eso no removes so that the statements that Roman *Prodi has taken from presentation in front of the European Parliament have to disappoint by strength and upset to those who expect of the European Union fast answers, audacious, to reorient *Europa to service of villages and of men and no of finances and of the powerful cavalier Gift Money so that *Europa affirm like an option in front of the *mundialización liberal.
Have to warn to #all managers. #If of here to little do not produces change in politics of Indonesian, *nos will see forced -and now *me direct to the Council and to the Commission- to loom to this country with #all the economic means that have to our scope to end to achieve cooperation of managers #indonesian.
Considers the Presidency of the Council in exercise, like the *PE, that already give conditions so that the majority of members of the General Assembly of Nations Joined pronounce this year in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium for the execution of penalties capital?
Now well, there are borrowers, particularly in *Irlanda, that have hired mortgages of fixed interest, sometimes to a type of interest that is three times more elevated that the current type, and the institutions borrowers do not want to adjust interest types without imposing considerable financial sanctions.
The juvenile delinquency *nos seems a problem of big *embergadura and is taking it in account, as we will be able to influence in the evolution of delinquency in the future, since the illicit guidelines of behaviour purchased in youth are harmful on a long-term basis, so much for criminals, through the consequences of offences, as also for society in group.
Regarding headquarters share the wise point of meeting proposed by Mr. *Swoboda and, finally, *me has enjoyed the image of ray of sun employed by Mr. Go *der *Waal, although *yo #would be more realistic: opens a ray of important hope, yes, but remains without resolving the political knot.
As a result of appeal of the European Council of Colony to create an agency, the proposal of the Commission bases mainly in the model of #all the other current #european agencies: a structure with own juridical personality and with powers to take decisions and in #whose council of administration are represented States members.
Among the maximalist positions, that demand recognition of the right to the return, *obviando the real problems that #would generate the massive return of refugees and the irreducible positions, that do not assume the existence of the problem, there are intermediate options that suits to explore, boost and set up.
innovations in this agreement are Article 4 on payments, Article 8 on visibility of the community contribution, Article 9 on arbitration and Article 12 on the entrance in vigour, #all *ellos directed to increase transparency and the surrender of accounts for approval.
First, the goal of decision proposal of the Council is not the to regulate information appeal *interinstitucional, but the to approve the text of the Agreement *CE-*OOPS and authorise to the Commission subscription of #the same in name of the Community.
Regarding the amendments approved in the Environment Commission, *nosotros have voted against the group of amendments that ask to the next coastal countries to the European Union that use programs *PHARE, *TACIS and *MEDA, to contribute financially to create a community frame of cooperation.
For example, in section 10 says that the European Parliament, quote: "considers urgent that, to facilitate integration of citizens of third countries residents legally in the territory of the European Union, #this tackle the relative principles to the statute of persons" .
In relation with point 19, that treats to give to *Europol operative faculties, think that it has to interpret like that it is development of collaboration of *Europol #whose goal is to boost the fight against the international delinquency, but #this has to make in the frame of the right of States members to have full control on the police activity inside territory.
In addition to the grave structural problems like investment fault, the public debt, in particular the external debt, has experienced a fast growth and in these moments is not clear how propose the authorities pay the interests of this heavy debt.
conflict in *Daguestán no only turns around crash among the #russian army and militants #islamic *chechenos. Also turns around questions like the weakness of *Rusia, oil of the Sea *Caspio, and poverty in the *Cáucaso northern, aggravated by the fault of economic support of *Moscú.
The European Union has to follow acting under the Presidency #finnish so that they reestablish what before relations with *Birmania, but on the base of respect to the human rights, to the result of the elections and with release of the #british prisoners arrested for defending democracy.
Appeal in any case to President of State and to Government so that it put of agreement together with #all the political strengths of the country on an electoral procedure that concede opportunities to any political group that respect the democratic rules of the game.
Before they precipitate *ustedes to leave , the General Secretary has agreed that, as they still appear #many of *ustedes in orator list, will consider #all the letters that *nos get like an explanation of vote that will publish in Record of today, always that they send the letters before the end of the next week so that they #can take proposals.
*Me #would enjoy to begin congratulating to my colleague #James *Provan by the excellent presidency of the debate that has been the first to the that have assisted being *él president and that has resulted a very interesting and useful exercise in the goal to improve conditions of work environment.
Commissioner *Byrne is -have to add- #worthy of *encomio by his prompt acceptance of the preparation of a White Book on legislation of the EU in matter of date back of this year and also give a more strict character to the system of fast #alert for emergencies in matter of foods.
And *cuando talk of the wide and modern concept of the human rights, also boy recently born and infected with the *HIV in *Zimbabwe is mate regarding the human rights and no the circles that consciously close the eyes and do not share with the population it that know on forms of treatment and especially of prevention.
*Permítanme that *les remember also that implantation of the alternative energies includes two significant subjects: the hydroelectric energy and the aeolian energy, that proportionally already represent a so important part that takes necessary to boost very acutely #all the remaining, as for example the solar energy, but also the *aprovechamiento of biomass.
The insistence in the diffusion of information in *ALTERNER *II is very important in truth and am desirous to see, #if it still is available, spot of the Centre *Agores in Mesh *Multimedios World-wide, that is allocated clearly to gather information class on the renewable energy so that #everyone #can *consultarla and keep to day.
An essential part of the Agreement is, besides, commitment of parts to defend the democratic principles, the human rights, Right State and the responsible administration of State.
No *me allow to judge the subjects posed by his *Señorías, but wanted to say that maybe this moment of dialogue with the Commission #would have to circumscribe to the debate and to the decisions taken by the Commission, because, of it contrary, runs the risk to finish in instrument, the that goes to begin inside instants, is to say, question turn.
Personally, am favourable to the idea, that *yo consider important in front of citizens and to the problems that arise, of a #european strength of civil security to act better together, with more rapidity and of a more visible form in case of natural catastrophe, so much in the territory of the Union as in outside and God knows that catastrophes do not are missing, as it shows actuality.
To tenor of an agreement with the humanitarian agents more representative, help will go especially directed to consolidate the humanitarian structures already existent in the zone and to help to the local population to help to the displaced with medical help, help alimentary and hostel.
Subject: conjoint Service for the community help to the countries no members (*SCR) there #be not time to give to the Commission with the litany of problems to that they have to face up the *ONG of the north and of the south by it that refers to credit reception for projects already agreed by the ancient *DG *VII.
These attempts have a fine base in correspondence kept among Prime minister #turkish, *Ecevit, and the previous Presidency of the European Union: Prime minister confirmed in a letter that *Turquía splits of the criteria of *Copenhague to carry out integration in the Union.
To advance in terrain need support of the European Parliament in the granting of concrete financial helps and a general backrest to approach and development of relations among *Turquía and the European Union.
With regard to the amendment 1, the Commission always has been of the opinion that politics on the renewable energy and politics on the energetic efficiency are closely related among himself\/hisself and have to be coordinated in common, but *nos ask #if it is not premature a letter on the renewable energy.
This resolution goes to encourage to diet #turkish to intensify the politics of repression against villages *kurdo and Turkish; to continue with occupation of *Chipre, to follow with #the same *intransigencia and contempt to the decisions of the UN and, finally, goes to exert a negative paper.
And second, in our own house, the Commission has to put things in order because in this moment services of the Commission commissioned to attend claims in front of solution organism of conflicts of the World-wide Organisation of Trade are absolutely deficient.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, believe that to these heights #all in Parliament coincide in the need to tackle the problem of the climatic change of rigorous form, no only for fulfilling commitment assumed by the European Union but also by the indisputable global importance of the problem.
Has knowledge President in exercise of the Council that the suspension of the free sales of taxes, against of the majority opinion of States members, has weakened airport strategy, aerial lines and companies of maritime transport of *pasajeros to keep rates it more possible drops?
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the tragedy of *Ustica, with more of 80 dead persons, almost twenty years of investigations, in addition to the 15 victims that it is necessary to relate with this tragedy during and after investigations, has to *obligarnos to *reflexionar on three crucial points: transparency, responsibility and the arrogance of type of military power and no only military.
Of mood that the tragedy of mount *Cermis did not go only a #italian problem and tackled to scale international, also *Ustica deserves this forum, deserves explanation and deserves respect in front of it that is magistrature that will have to get until bottom to end to determine responsibilities and *atribuirlas to the one who correspond.
Has to have a complete cooperation among #all States members of the European Union #if we want to be in conditions to exert part that *nos corresponds in the reduction of level of gas broadcasts of effect *invernadero, that so destructive paper are at present in our own world-wide environment.
Now well, *nos have *percatado that reason that the Commission wished to formulate the statement Friday was that Thursday had a meeting of the veterinary scientific Committee that goes to occupy of this question, and therefore the Commission wanted to be in conditions to give more informations Friday.
Fight Office against Fraud, created, as it is logical, to watch by the fine execution of the community budget, has *algo that see with the establishment of control in #all the directions applied without discrimination #any no only to agents, but also -like somebody already has signalled- to members of the institutions?
Was a very important decision in *pro of the creation of this office, as the fight against fraud exerts a central paper in the assessment of the #european politics by part of citizens and of citizens of States members.
Finally, the directive constitutes also a good example of a consistent performance of the European Union in the field of Inner Subjects, in the inner market, but, to time, constitutes an opening to the international cooperation.
Need the advantages for security that indicate in the Directive of Mr. *Ferri, but also need to focus with #a lot of greater amplitude form of *ocuparnos of the world-wide technical norms in an industry of capital importance for the European Union.
The European Union has assumed commitment to fund reconstruction of *Kosovo. At present, in *Kosovo no only is necessary to reconstruct the bridges, schools, the technical infrastructure, but also reestablish, of general way, a democratic civil society and peaceful in the region.
Without embargo, #this no means that it #can opt for following road of discounts and think that they will be able to release quietly resources to fund politics in other fields by means of linear cuts in the agricultural sector, that did not includes only costs allocated to agriculturalists, but also for the group of the rural space.
Also #can create *algo of space, and maybe was an idea for negotiations with the Council, to take out of bottom for the humanitarian helps the 89 millions allocated to the humanitarian actions in *Kosovo and *incluirlos in the integral package for finance of the region.
This year, that is a key year with war of *Kosovo, the events of *Timor, the earthquakes of *Turquía, commitments of a Union that pretends more responsible in the international scene, the Council *nos proposes a budget of 92 *millardos, is to say, 4 *millardos less that the budget of the previous year.
On the other hand, also is necessary to elaborate -in look do not agree with #some of orators that *me have preceded- a statute of the political parties Europeans. In effect, *yo believe that it also is necessary a greater transparency and a greater efficiency in the field of finance of parties to scale #european.
In fact, do not have to forget that the true competitor are *ellos and that, therefore, only the budgetary politics directed to protect investments and the economic growth, *nos will allow to seat the bases of a Union surely stronger from the point of sight structural and economic.
Without embargo, and assuming that fishing is a community politics #whose finance gives off of the Treaties, has found among #all formula that allows not refusing in first reading the amendments of the Council, included the referred to fishing, but differ approval until moment in that it achieve a financial agreement with the Council.
*Yo want to remember that Parliament has supported to said federation of associations that groups to the organisations of #european women and *le has entrusted transposition of action platform of *Pequín in the field of the no governmental organisations, and *me seems that it #would be disastrous that organisation of women #can benefit now of said budget.
communication politics awards a clear priority to keep and improve the credibility of the *SEBC and confidence in the euro, being things -the credibility and confidence- crucial elements for the fine course of the monetary politics.
The commission also refused sight point of the Greens, expressed in amendment of today, that it #would be necessary to modify the relative mandate to stability of prices to take into account difficulties to the that #would confront only manufacturers #if they dropped prices.
In effect, on the one hand, #all *nosotros have appreciated the increasing paper that said Institution - and to time, of reflection, #all the Union - has come exerting in the last time in terms of economic politics and, especially, labour; by #another, #this has not sufficed so that the euro did not suffer the effects of speculations and weakened in front of competitors - that do not have to exclude at all - that they are States Joined and the *NAFTA.
Has been the first meeting of this type since the European Parliament ratified the new School of Commissioners European, and the new President, Roman *Prodi, has declared many times his sincere commitment to explain much more with Parliament in the taking of decisions in the future.
In *tercer place, this summit has been important because although until then we had reached to take reality the Economic and Monetary Union, without embargo, this special summit has given a *primer step to a Union of Security, to a space of freedom, security and of the right for citizens of *Europa.
Before yielding the use of the word to my colleague #Michel *Barnier, that goes to present to His *Señorías the goals of the Conference *Intergubernamental, wish to appreciate again to Parliament support that has loaned to the Commission in this project, project of *Tampere, spirit of *Tampere, letter of *Tampere, but especially project of citizens of our common Union.
is not *superfluo work in *pro of a reorganisation of the Treaty to go back it more readable and more accessible to citizens and to imagine day a more comfortable modification of the common politics, by opposition to the fundamental principles of the Union.
deletes the right to veto, diminishes the influence of the small nations, President of the Commission transforms in Prime minister species in a European Commission increasingly powerful, and the EU #would be a military Union.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0028\/1999) of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market concerning the common position (14248\/3\/1998 - *C5-*COD 1994\/0011) approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to transport facilities of persons by wire (Speaker: Mr. *Miller)
madness, the committed by Senate #american, that, as it said Commissioner, Mr. *Patten, probably not even has committed by strategic calculations, but by internal fights, it that worsens the question and, especially, as it has *recalcado, incites to countries that already are nuclear powers, to not ratifying the Treaty, and incites to countries to purchase nuclear arms.
Gentleman President, do not need to go back to go in in the subjects that so *sucintamente has *resumido Mr. *Patten in particular - except that *me #would enjoy to go back to take upsetting in the danger that action of the Senate send the mistaken message to falcons of the *Duma #russian that up to now have not answered to the initiatives directed to the nuclear disarmament.
Gentleman President, am very satisfied that the speech of Parliament was so unanimous, and is well that the Commission, Parliament and the Council have *recalcado the importance of support of the European Union to the Treaty of total prohibition of nuclear proofs.
In relation with *Rusia, always are in the agenda subjects, #any one that was the institution involved, so much #if it treats of questions of the fight against criminality, of economic reforms, of a reasonable legislation in *Rusia, for example, on bunch of Banking or taxes and in point #can detect that they produce some effective progresses.
#can accept the amendment 11, relative to information paper of contact points, on condition that his regional actions, that #can complement his national paper, base in disposals in vigour in the different States members and no comport increase #any of the financial contribution of the Community.
Have taken fine note -with joy, have to say it- of enthusiasm that has expressed in enclosure, of enthusiasm with the that young deputies and less youngsters have engaged so that youngsters of our continent #can in the future -more still that in the past, because #everyone agreed also in underlining that program "Youth" has contributed already a lot to millions of youngsters- build on it that already has taken well.
#This #would have to facilitate payment of the community contribution to the budget of the European Observatory of *Estrasburgo for 1999, is to say, for the year in course, #whose delay hampered and hampers the operation of the institution, and *yo create - although #all the commission thinks it same - that operation is important and fundamental for the European Commission and the 34 States members that form part and that continue incorporating actively to the Observatory.
Without embargo, has been missing a juridical foundation *vinculante and #this is it that wants to create now on the base of section 3 of article 130 to of the Treaty of the *CE, taking into account that information centre has to contribute fundamentally to strengthen competitiveness of the audiovisual industry improving information flow.
Finish to decide -have to remember it- that the common rule contained in the Agreement *interinstitucional and accompanied by the necessary measures allocated to facilitate development flowed of investigations of service, of compliance with the decision of Parliament that attaches to the Regulation like Annex, will apply inside Parliament.
. (THE) The *altanería of the *superpotencia #american, put already clearly to the discovered in the criminal bombardments against *Yugoslavia, adopts dimensions of own provocation of a conception of only empire in front of #all villages of earth, with the continuous decisions of the Senate on investigation and the development of nuclear arms.
After the recent decision of the Senate to return to actuality the known "war of the stars" , voting in favour of *financiarla, in clear transgression of the Agreement *ABM, the refusal to ratify the Treaty of No Nuclear Proliferation supposes a *provocativo contempt to the world-wide demand of general and definite cessation of the nuclear proofs.
main Goal of this community legislation is the extension of regulation mentioned, that regulate the international rail transport of dangerous commodities (*RID), to the field of the national transport, is to say, transport that takes place in the national territory of each #one of States members.
Is therefore by it that this report, seen like an isolated initiative, #can cause the impression to encircle to a very concrete question, but when situating it in the #european frame, remains clear that goes much more there of the specific subject of the transport of dangerous commodities by railway.
On the other hand, subsidies never go to get to part of the population affected by east tie up: to Mrs. #Manuela, that has fishmonger; to Mr. #Antonio, that has appliance shop; not even, to bank carpentry, that practises in school-workshop of *Galicia, in *Rianxo, because they do not go to have ships that repair.
Gentleman President, take part in this debate to show my position and to show also support wish to #all postures that contribute, so much in Parliament as in the European Commission, to attainment of a new agreement of the European Union with Realm of *Marruecos.
granting is, in our opinion, a good incentive for #all women and #all men that in the world, in our regions, struggle by the application of peace, by defence of the human rights, by freedom and democracy.
The *segunda reason is that, in the past and also very recently, this subject has loaned to operations of image that #can have been amused in *algún case, like the image to take smuggling of meat among two countries of the Community, but do not think that it was necessary to go back to resurrect wars among countries because *eso #can seem a parody concerning a subject that is very serious.
refer to five subjects: *rastreabilidad, supplementary proofs, questions relative to the derivative products, supplementary information on controls, inspection and controls of the Alimentary and Veterinary Office in facilities of *Truro, in *Devon, in the that sacrifices and exports product and, by *ultimo, on the question of labeling.
Of course, still have not adopted official decisions and, as I have said to His *Señorías takes moment, the constitutional structure of said agency is still for deciding and also his reciprocal effects with the institutions of the European Union and with the national agencies of alimentary security of States members.
In effect, #if the Central Bank says the clear things, takes, by like this say it, the *haraquiri; #if, when talking with #this actors, do not says the clear things - neither will have to take it because the Central Bank has to take things - then talks for talking and loses time.
Also treats that it establish sure enough dialogue with Parliament, since participation is necessary in practice so that dialogue define also some very concrete guidelines in favour of citizens and citizens, that #can *confluir afterwards in the Forum on employment, under the Presidency #portuguese.
Have to say to President of the Council *ECOFIN and to Commissioner *Solbes Watches that it that initiate in dialogue *macroeconómico in the next days will not refer so only to it that is at present, but that will serve to create the ideal atmosphere so that, in case that it have a problem or difficult questions, #can *sentarnos, in reality, with the social speakers and contrive solutions for our problems.
#All *nosotros, a new Parliament and a new Commission, have to materialise a decision that was taken in Colony Council, before being here *nosotros, and believe that it is our political will develop, change, give a distinct form to dialogue time that have tested it, *cuando have the first experiences and *cuando see in how direction will have to make changes.
persons have more difficulties that colleagues of other economic sectors to hour to defend in front of discriminations, especially, because they do not work with colleagues of permanent form and neither in place that was fixed and easily accessible for the #sindical representatives.
Have to underline that there #be a big distance among the proposal of the Council and the of the European Parliament; and the Commission comes with a conciliatory proposal, of a transitory period of 7 years for the application of a maximum level of 48 hours.
The EU goes to provide technical help to develop the energetic resources, to boost the effective use and saving of energy, and to cater clean and renewable energy, in addition to the use of technicians that are respectful of the environment.
Finally, believe that it is of big importance the establishment of these regular contacts among the European Parliament and Argentinian, and no only in this matter but also in the economic terrain, social and cultural, since it is an obligation of the European Union consolidate our presence in this country with the that Europeans have *tantas things in common.
In quality of legislative organ European, will not be able to avert have to establish in the future some maximum values and some clear terms with seen to achieve a perceivable reduction of broadcasts of harmful gases.
Expect that the strategy on the inner market *nos give the opportunity to expand cooperation to the preliminary stage, in the that fix action priorities; and to execution stage, in the that it is necessary to occupy that the rules work of optimum form.
Have the greater opportunity never known to take that the Only Market was a reality for agents exclusive and #SME in States members that before #can have not thought in selling out of his immediate place.
Each fixed country his own priorities in matter of politics of employment and to this *respecto, like members of the *ELDR, go to *permitirnos celebrate the fact that during these last years was in the majority of countries members a politics of liberal employment that takes upsetting in guaranteeing the suitable incentives in matter of fiscal and social politics.
In the amendment 1 say that "we urge especially to the creation of strategy of similar social convergence to the process of *Luxemburgo for employment, with #whose help #can ensure the priority of the model of social cohesion in the economic politics and of employment" .
Calls attention and invites to reflection the fact that the countries situated out of the zone euro have activity tax higher and #if we abandon the European Union, find even activity tax even more high, *me refer to neighbour Norwegian.
Therefore, the Commission #can accept, in principle, the need to study the possible expansion of the scope of this concept, to include characteristics of vehicles, as they #can be noise and fuel consumption and propulsion technologies.
Gentleman President, as they signalled previous orators, the best way to celebrate this convention is that it have converted in a powerful and important tool for the European Union, so much for politics inner as for the external.
Big part of #everything *eso has to to cruelty or negligence of adults and it minimum that they #can take adults is to watch by that, *cuando boy *carece for real of family, *le apply disposals of the Agreement of The Have to hour to offer to boy an opportunity in life by means of the adoption.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0052\/1999) of Mrs. *Haug, in name of Budget Commission, on decision proposal of the Council (*COM(1999)333 - *C5-0092\/1999 - 1999\/0139(*CNS)) relative to the system of own resources of the European Union.
And do not forget how much time has happened since it began application and how many positive changes there #be had during time. #Can mention as main the creation of the *UEM from 1 January 1999, the aspired enlargement, with the countries of *Europa central and oriental, *Chipre and Malt and, finally, Diary 2000, that prescribes, among things, the modifications that have to take in the agricultural sector.
Believe that in rare occasions has occurred that a speaker had to occupy during a budgetary exercise of more of 60 transfers of credits and five supplementary budgets, a big number of modifications and *complementos to the budget *originario, it that in the last debate on the budget *rectificativo and supplementary *IV *le has moved to say that it no longer recognised to his own boy, is to say, the budget 1999.
And *le take the word so that in the year 2000, in a conjoint work, much more intense and more open, from the principle #can avert that priorities like the regions *bálticas or actions in favour of boys are not the first affected, because #one has suspicion that perhaps they are not *ustedes those who do not want to execute *eso, but instances that are behind.
The report *nos remembers that to reach an important improvement of protection measures of the world-wide environment and the reduction of broadcasts, need dialogue and consensus with our commercial competitors and with the countries in development.
Another challenge, of capital importance, refers to contradiction -that *me seems especially strong- among liberalisation of the energetic networks, favourable certainly, to drop of prices, but also, to time, to waste, and to the promotion of a rational and economic utilisation of energy.
The directive on great facilities of combustion to reduce sulphide dioxide and nitrogen oxides and program Car *Oil to face up to the problem of the quality of the air in cities are some very stood out examples.
And to conclude, gentleman President, varied orators have taken reference to a wider debate in the that they contemplated #all looks relative no only to demand looks and environmental but also to look of our energetic sources and of our energetic dependency according to future forecasts.
Gentleman President, have had knowledge that services of Parliament -do not know #if by instruction of Speaker- have forbidden press conference of President of the Court of Accounts of the European Union in venues of Parliament.
In this frame, Parliament already had occasion to approve modification proposals of varied directives allocated to improve from the point of technological sight the engines and the quality of fuels.
In effect, while it keeps very wanders in relation with the greater part of the relative environmental questions to the sector of energy, this resolution asks that, in the countries of the European Union, electricity production of nuclear origin conserve, in the future, at least part that has at present.
Today have voted in this Assembly on the report of the colleague *Chichester and have said in this context of a very clear mood that refuse any *imposición or any type of indirect recommendation to change to the nuclear security.
For States of the that it treats is an important argument because they know that the European Parliament has to give assent at the end of adhesion negotiations, is to say, that without the European Parliament #can not be and is by #this by it that the wishes of the European Parliament are of the greater importance in this question.
In relation with deficiencies in the registers of livestock and other, the application of export plan according to a calendar established, #such as *yo understand it, protects the public health and guarantees the alimentary security in relation with meat export of bovine of Realm Joined.
Gentleman President, the Commission presented recently to the Council, to the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee a communication subordinated to the subject "The victims of delinquency in the European Union - reflection on norms and measures that have to adopt".
To reach the economic and social stability, increase the social welfare of citizens of the countries candidates and avert the risk of *dumping social in the current States members, enlargement will demand that the countries candidates *modernicen systems of social security.
The adoption of the Letter of Security in *Europa, #if it signs in the next days, will be definitely element that will enhance the authority of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in *Europa, and will be definitely a valuable complement of development of security politics of the Union.
*Cuando *usted was General Secretary of the Western European Union and #this integrate in the European Union, #this will pose, of course, a new task of parliamentary control and the European Parliament will have to assume function together with the national Parliaments, that will conserve likewise control function in this field.
Achieve, definitely, have a common coin, have advanced in the field of the economy and has got moment to advance in the field of politics, and very specifically in the field of the external politics and of security politics.
The #french delegation of Group *opone to this modification of the juridical nature of act, in the sense that the regulation allows to take better in consideration the impact of the budgetary discipline in States members as in the community institutions.
Without embargo, also think that, time that the Russians *nos have asked that we act like observers in the elections to the *Duma, have to consider very seriously the suitability to answer to request of Parliament, since *ello #would constitute a new contribution to dialogue and to development of democracy, and perhaps also of a political more suitable, in *Rusia.
It important is that *le take to know to *Rusia that this message is explicit, that it is necessary to finish with the use of violence against the civil population, that it is necessary to begin negotiations with the representatives chosen legally in *Chechenia, that the humanitarian help is necessary and has to get to destination and that the *OSCE #would have to have paper determinant in the solution of this conflict.
But peasants, that will have been deleted, the liberal professions *marginadas, the textile industry, chemist, footwear, the heavy vehicles, pieces of furniture, fuselages, toys, #everything *eso that will have delivered to competition *extraeuropea, how will take with *ello?
Thus I expect can cover, comprise and recognise the aspirations of the world developed and of the world in roads of development, and recognise the enormous advantages of the free trade world-wide, to time that recognise also the need *imperiosa to reach the transition that allow and confer powers to the world in development to convert in speaker in equality of conditions of globalisation.
The *mundialización leaves to feel effects in the social field in #all the countries, but is necessary to ascertain that, in a series of countries less advanced, the norms of international work admitted in the frame of the International Organisation of Work do not respect sufficiently.
From sight point of our interests *multilaterales #as well as of our own interests all depend of the content of the agreement that has signed; the #american Congress has wanted to have the novelty of the content of the quoted agreement, procedure by the *cual this Assembly #would have to have more charm that antipathy, although *me complicate life.
Ask that it apply the community method, by analogy with article 48, expect that the present Commission a concrete proposal that serve of base for negotiations and also expect can reach consensus with the Council and with the Commission on the agenda and on the procedure of the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
To opinion, the double legitimacy of the Union, like Union of States, on the one hand, but by the #another side also like Union of villages, has to remain reflected in recognition of power of *codecisión of Parliament in looks relative to the content of the futures Treated in the future negotiations with seen to the review.
The political tensions that have characterised the start of this term of office no are the necessary convergences among the distinct, important, the most important, parliamentary Groups in terrain of the strengthening of the Union, of Institutions and of politics.
Gentleman President, *le appreciate that *me concede the use of the word instants in this moment of the debate, in the that have been able to listen with attention to the speakers to the that it already had heard, but also to the representatives and to orators of the different Groups that occupy seats of Parliament, is to say, to #many of His *Señorías.
*Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen the fact of having seated the bases of a new *foedus, of pact luck after the #european unit that organises around differences, tries mediations and, especially, treats to find some principles and some fundamental units.
The Commission presented afterwards to the Council, to the European Parliament, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions communication containing the action plan to combat drugs during the period 2000 - 2004.
My opinion is that in meeting argued the subject of drug of correct way, more coherent, to design the future strategy, especially in it that *atañe to trade with drug and terrains affine as, for example, the fight against money wash.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, as I have said, the intention of the Commission is to take out to *relucir this subject in the bilateral conversations related with taking of a preferential agreement on liberalisation of services and of the acquisitions of the public sector among the EU and *Turquía.
Report (To5-0066\/1999) of Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the European Office of Fight against Fraud (*OLAF)
*Señorías, it that go to say *reviste importance, since they have contributed modifications to the text that did not obtain the necessary qualified majority in Plenary in the partial period of sessions of the month of October, to instance of the greater political Group that then expressed reservations and posed requirements of greater explanations.
The commission likewise has accepted amendment of Gentlemen *Nassauer and *Brok, by means of the *cual -read literally the amendment that converts in the new article 4 of decision project- "have to follow without changes norms relative to the parliamentary immunity and to the right of deputy to no *testificar" .
My Group has examined very painstakingly the report and have got to the conclusion that it treats of the technical materialisation of the agreement that signed Parliament in relation with the parliamentary immunity, and that they will not cancel the privileges without having followed the procedure prescribed.
Report (To5-0066\/1999) of Mr. *Napolitano, in name of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, on the modifications of the Regulation as a result of the Agreement *Interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations effected by the European Office of Fight against Fraud (*OLAF)
#can not refuse in advance the requirements of countries members of the *OMC so that we reform our agricultural politics in the Round of #Millenium, taking that this agreement really was development instrument that contribute to diminish differences among poor and rich countries.
Now well, nobody doubts that during negotiations, commitment text, given to light with pain, will be object of multiple pressures by North American part, *cuando the Union did not presents more that an apparent homogeneity and did not has of a juridical arsenal comparable to the of States Joined, able, #if it was necessary, to deter to the North American part.
The second principle #would have to be confinement" of the *OMC to represent paper strictly delimited, and keep out of competition field sectors that only #can depend of sovereignty of States and of the institutions chosen by citizens, since said sectors *atañen to the own identity of society.
Thus, although the text of the resolution subjected this morning to vote was acceptable with regard to the general goals that *nos had fixed, graces especially to the numerous amendments presented by members of my Group, have not voted in favour of said text, to respect commitments that have assumed in front of the constituents of the #french Departments of *ultramar (*D.Or.*M.).
Like this, is fundamental that the European Union, States members and #all the international community keep a strong pressure on the #indonesian authorities so that, with the greater urgency, disarm and control to the designated "militias" and believe security conditions necessary for the return of refugees to *Timor Oriental, #whose territorial integrity has to be respected entirely.
Wanted to stand out also the proposal that has taken of sending of a new delegation of the European Parliament to *Timor Oriental, precisely to verify *in crazy how is and occurring reconstruction process and have of #all the necessary elements that allow to follow keeping the of *Timor Oriental like a subject that deserves the unanimous attention of #all the #european deputies.
Have to cooperate without reservations with the Sent Special of the European Union, with the European Union, with Nations Joined, with the Organisation of the African Unit and with #all the agencies of humanitarian help to take all it that it was necessary to end to carry peace and stability to *Ruanda and to the region of the Great Lakes of *África in general.
Only wanted *decirles that in principle was adherent of this resolution, as it is logical, but to mood to see has initiated a very dangerous game that consists in using systematically the resolutions to open an ideological debate on the letter of fundamental rights.
Nevertheless, wail deeply that amendment, in the that express wish to suspend temporarily in the frame of war the association agreement and cooperation in virtue of the clause on the human rights that carries included, have not deserved support of this Assembly.
Is vice that weakens the will, that complicates to individual in dependency that enslaves it and depersonalises it, that finishes with bows and the social relations, that engenders delinquency, increases insecurity and feeds the criminal networks of world-wide field, that challenge to the law and to power of States.
action in the field of education, of family, the economic cooperation with associations and *ONG, and very especially in the field of leisure and of sport, complement performances that owe *desterrar of life of youngsters leakage valve that sometimes *les supposes to attend to forms of evasion that finish *destruyéndolos.
In spite of direct and indirect support of the European Union to the bank, the *BEI enjoys to present publicly like a totally normal bank and like this has justified in the happened his relative inaccessibility, in comparison with other public institutions like the World-wide Bank, in questions of cooperation and of control in front of the administration.
Have struggled *duramente from the Commission of Budgetary Control during six years to be able to throw glimpse to accounts of the bank and yesterday reach at last an agreement on control of the bank by the office against fraud, the *OLAF.
The subject is of special importance, given urgency of the subject, in measure in that we no longer have excessive time to set up the new procedure, since the current system finishes to finals of the month of January and it is necessary to reach a bilateral agreement among the Bank and the Commission.
And has promised to present a recommendation in the that will collect #all subjects relative to the public health, health of youngsters sporty, health of sportsmen in general, with seen to a big action *concertada of States members in the fight against doping.
Today fulfil with our mandate, lady Speaker and *Señorías, because the Commission has decided to present a relative plan to a communication on the *salvaguardia of the current sportive structures and on the maintenance of the social function of sport in the community frame.
Lady Commissioner, the congratulate by it that has had to see in relation with the set up of the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, although I also ask, as sporty, that, the same that they go to impose to athletes some strict norms in the subject of doping -sew that *me seems very well-, *les listen to *ellos and put interests above the economic and commercial interests, thing that no always has taken up to now.
Gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, today the Union is an institution that did not respects the minimum principles of democracy and of right State and by #this, to *nosotros, the radicals, federalistic Europeans, promoters of States Joined of *Europa like the posed *Altiero *Spinelli, *nos results difficult to consider as true progresses the small, really small, reforms that appear in diary.
Wail also that our proposal of common resolution do not mention the problems linked with *Eurodac, in the precise moment in the that the Council finishes to announce, in contradiction with the Treaties, that organ #would have to follow being purely *intergubernamental, it that excludes to Parliament and to the Court of Justice of control to the *respecto.
Is necessary to have care: #if in *Helsinki the Council and the Governments will not open diary of the Conference to essential institutional subjects and already mature, will not be credible the speech on enlargement and will put of self-evident that do not knows to pose vision *previsora of development of the Union in #all dimensions.
treats of a general problem and, therefore, go to include, no in section of enlargement, but in the agenda the general assembly of the summit, that so much States members like the aspiring to adhesion have to improve fulfillment of the rights of minorities.
Also there #be section devoted to the priorities and to particular subjects of the human rights, as, for example, the rights of woman, of boys and of minorities, #as well as rejection of death pity and of racism.
In opinion of the Commission, so as to offer a more complete panorama of the situation in matter of human rights in the field of the European Union, #would suit that the report considered in way future more balanced the three *pilares of the European Union.
The challenge that have for the next #millenium is to leave that the needs of boys guide the social work in #all forms, having like point of game the right of boys to father and to mother and to grow in a safe familiar surroundings.
In the proposal of the relative Commission to bottoms for the promotion of the economic and social development of *Turquía and the consolidation of the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía proposes that #this *englobe the period 2000-2002 because *nos have dipped so much in this year that it has taken too much late to establish new budgetary lines with this end in 1999.

In consequence, the Commission attributes importance, at the end of this term of office, to the fact to put to day in the processing of the requests, so as to can examine, with occasion of the two last meetings of Request Commission, chaired by Mr. *Fontana, the greater part of the *dossiers still pending.

The Commission has assumed always responsibilities to hour to guarantee competitiveness of the #european industry of starch, of processing industry and, in particular of the sector *biotecnológico that uses starch and derivatives like matter prevails.
Therefore, gentleman President, have estimated *proponerle, following our jurisprudence, following norms established that the parliamentary immunity do not protects to the same member, but to #all the Assembly and to Parliament, that do not suspend the parliamentary immunity. #This say it in particular because we think, in line of my illustrate precursors, #Georges *Donnez and #Jean *Defraignes, that treats here in mood of the «*fumus *persecutionis».
Think that it will have a *reforzamiento and a better follow-up of relations among Parliament and the Commission in matter of control of the budgetary management and expect that, with this regulation, Parliament #can take a still better work in matter of control of the budgetary management of the Commission.
Therefore, the European Bank of Investments and Bottom have to release more bottoms and, on the other hand, States members have to have the possibility of *oxigenar economy through his own budgetary politics, not taking the stability pact even more strict but by means of a more flexible interpretation.

On this approval of the management, on this report of colleague, Mr. *Brinkhorst, have elaborated also #some specific documents. Owe *decirles that am a so much irritated by the fact that we have not received, at all, reaction of the current Commission to documents that shortly go to have three months.
Second, the question of decentralisation and competition transfer of the Commission, in particular in the sphere of the external programs, is extraordinarily important, but need norms very strict for the delegation of the management of the community politics and always have to pursue actively.
And said #this, gentleman President, *nosotros *nos confront today to change that *resume very well the philosophy of Parliament, change that, in words of Commissioner Mr. Ear, endows, from the first of May, to the European Union «of an instrument more *performante, more opened to dialogue with citizens, more democratic and more projected to the external world».

#If *ustedes, in deputy quality of the European Parliament, take #his the proposal of State Bosses and of Government and approve the day after tomorrow the nomination of Mr. *Prodi, the Governments will proceed to continuation, as following step, to designate of common agreement with President nominated to personalities that propose to appoint like members of the Commission.
Finally, is necessary that approve reform directed to increase transparency so that Parliament, at least, have access to a document of the Commission so prompt like #this deliver it to a committee, to company, to a country, to journalist or to any #another person that do not form part of the institution.
adds likewise the important subject of effort to convert in more dynamic the #european economy -in speech appear indications to the *respecto- inside a balance that has to be new, but that it has to exist, is to say, the balance of social character of the #european economy.
In effect, in statements prevails development idea understood like continuous growth without loaning attention to the natural limits of resources: an infinite growth is a dangerous utopia of economists that #can not find an answer in the reality.

Said amendments of commitment no *surtirán the effect expected, is to say, limit the negative consequences for consumers and honey producers #european of a regulation that do not protects sufficiently the quality of the fine #european honeys against honeys mattered and, it that it is worse, that favours fraud.

So much States members like the Commission have coincided in underlining that delay in the adoption of the strategy #can give place to false interpretations by #russian part and *yo believe that to #all *nos interests that they do not intensify tensions among the European Union and *Rusia in the complex international situation current.
The new institution, «gentleman or the external political lady», has to have a predominantly preventive function and collaborate with the *OSCE, the UN, etc. #All #can regret not to have it reached in the *Balcanes and that at the end was necessary intervention, without embargo, also it is necessary to signal that we have to be had to *ello *cuando produce rapes so grave and evident of the human rights.
But there #be amendment of the liberal Group, that deputies think to support, in the *cual proposes -on the base of the text that the Council *nos has offered in the contrary sense- an alternative text that believe #can obtain the approval of the Council.
Gentleman President, #can not talk of the Statute of deputy and of it that #this means today without taking effort for containing a true dose of indignation, caused by the climate in the *cual have developed the debates, under pressure of complaints formulated in #some media, that have caused a true distortion in discussions.
Never have understood to the socialists, that in a principle demand a big increase of the *gravámenes for road utilisation, but that afterwards throw backwards in front of the requirement that Parliament, in his big majority, believed correct in the year 1997 and that it was more elevated of it that the Council has proposed now.

The only question that *nos poses is #if, taking into account the reduction that has taken of the financial perspectives of the 2000 to the 2006, the European Union goes to have in the next years of sufficient resources for an own politics of employment, since practically #all the community politics have had to be *recortadas.
But, even in the supposed that #all worries went object of examination with seen to the Summit of State bosses or of Government, will not suppose a sufficiently adapted answer to the gravity of the crisis of *Kosovo and no *suplirán patent absence of *Europa in this specific flank of the continental actuality.
Colony has to give a signal also in this field to make this economic politics that establish the goals that have to reach as, for example, a different relation with the World-wide Organisation of Trade, the relaunching of the quality of the #european product, the no *imposición of companies.
In the agricultural politics, thanks to a more intense orientation to the world-wide market and to the environment, agriculture in the countries candidates to adhesion obtains already today some important foundations of planning for orientation of his agricultural production.

work that have taken in representation of Parliament in this report, in narrow contact with my colleagues -Mr. #Walter and Mr. *Sonneveld-, has treated precisely to coordinate #all help process and, besides, to include the criteria of Parliament.
*Tercer point: here no treats of the question of the granting in the sense of justice or injustice or of the envy but that price pressure that exert exploitations that follow living with compensation excess by the high payment of premiums, will affect to the small *amenazándolas in existence.
With the new introduction of measures for the rural areas and with the strengthening of accompaniment measures existent from reform of 1992, has given step to a global agricultural politics for the rural areas.
*Yo believe that this message encloses a double danger: first, because it puts of self-evident, in mouth of the author of reform, that the current measures of reform will not be sufficiently effective, and #this even before applying ; and second, because it is not possible that agriculturalist and the #european grazier develop activity and schedule future without a frame of minimum stability.
time that have implanted Regulation relative to the Social Bottom for the new period, the Social Bottom *recobrará new life thanks to that takes greater upsetting in dimension of employment in #all the community politics and in the structural Bottoms in particular.

Likewise regret that in relation with the possibilities of national cooperation do not yield the election of the zones of the Goal 2 that remain out of the strict criteria to States members, but that, as before, remains limited by the Commission through criteria and consent reservation.
Is fundamental to guarantee that #all the regions with communities *pesqueras follow having an every time greater access to the structural bottoms for the sector of fishing without that produce attempt for reducing finance levels or for excluding said access increasing the complexity of the procedures.
As it already has signalled in the course of this debate, the system provides obviously an important bond among the Commission and the representatives of the national authorities presents in the committees and that assist to the Commission in his executive function.
Of course, the Commission will follow contributing actively in this work with hope to be able to get to an agreement, before it finalise the Presidency #german, that satisfy to the three institutions and that, therefore, *redunde in benefit of citizens of the Union, to those who have to serve, and that will be undoubtedly by millions awaiting awake to hours of the night the result of this debate.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate on the report (To4-0261\/99) of Mrs. *Jöns, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on directive proposal of the relative Council to the agreement mark on length work determined celebrated by the *UNICE, the *CEEP and the *CES (*COM(1999)0203 - *C4-0220\/1999).
The Presidency #german recognises fully that integration of the *acervo of *Schengen in the frame of the EU *reviste a special importance of face to the future activities of the European Parliament and understands that Parliament have interest in following of wall the previous steps to said integration.
The agreement establishes, besides, that a considerable part of disposals of the *acquis of *Schengen, especially disposals that have to see with the free circulation of persons, asylum, immigration and border controls, *comunitariza in his greater part and, therefore, Parliament and the Court of Justice will see involved in the future in development of politics.
*Señorías, #if we want to struggle against the increasing illegalities, is necessary that the that offer services through network are able to facilitate #all the necessary information to look for and find to the providers of illicit contents respecting, as it is obvious, it that has the community Right regarding respect of the personal data.
In this moment debate a directive, that is directive relative to determined looks juridical of the electronic trade in the inner market, that treats to harmonise determined looks of the Right of States members through this procedure -a directive- that, in reality, are looks of private Right.
As it occurs always that has a subject that interests to pressure groups, #one of the problems that arise is that pressure groups cancel #one to #others, which shows how deputies of the European Parliament have to be able to face up to the that exert pressures, to the equal that have to be able to face up to journalists.
In matter of responsibility of network operators in line, the initial proposal of the European Commission, without denying the relative problems to illegality of the content, distinguishes responsibility of the different actors, in function of his real activity.
responsibility limitation affects to #all the on-line illegal activities of third, #such like disloyal competition, deceptive advertising, but also to piracy in the field of author right, like this deduces of the explanation of the proposal of the Commission.
Is also the case of the amendments that try to modify the field of application of the directive of way that is not coherent with other directives on services of society of information (amendments *núms. 27 and 63) and of the amendment 31, that modifies the definition proposed of the commercial communications.
*Nos cheer that, together with the texts of the new Regulations, have seated the bases for an effective collaboration in the management of bottoms, also thanks to the Code of behaviour among the Commission and Parliament with regard to the application of the structural politics.
contingent of 600 representatives of Nations Joined to organise and observe the process *referendario is constituted by civilians disarmed, to the that in moment will add also 250 also disarmed policemen, without possibility #any to defend to nobody, neither to himself\/hisself same, in front of activity *impune of militias *prointegracionistas that seed terror in *Dili and in the rest of the territory.
*B-0462\/99 of deputies #Harrison and #others, in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists-*B4-0491\/99 of deputies *Pasty and go *Bladel, in name of the Group Union by *Europa-*B4-0506\/99 of deputy *Telkämper, in name of the Group of the Greens in Parliament *Europeosobre the political manipulation of trials in *Malasia;
And, second, the Council #be to agree formula that will provide a juridical base for the remote access to a terrestrial season for satellites that there #be in #Italia by means of the introduction of a new clause in agreement project on mutual legal assistance in criminal questions.
The present proposal basically takes case *omiso of the European Agreement for the Protection of the Human Rights and of the Fundamental Freedoms and of disposal that appears in article 8 on the protection of the private life of persons.
Finally, wanted to take #this like reason to appeal again to the Council so that we are proud no only by it that take in the cultural field, but also by *preocuparnos that programs find a suitable finance, because it do not reaches at all #if we excite to the public with these wonderful programs of the European Union but afterwards *les assign a ridiculous financial endowment.
After exhibition of the year 2005, for my big joy, have been already assigned to *Japón, specifically to *Nagoya, wanted to *recordarles that in exhibition of *Osaka got to a series of errors bureaucratic scandalous, and *cuando had built already pavilion of *Europa, denied to plant the statue of *Coudenhove-*Kalergi.
To fault of a positive action of the Commission, #whose plan of #tending action to strengthen competitiveness of the sector, that examine in 1998, has not had up to now a concrete result, #some States members, as *Francia, *España, *Portugal, have taken measures to brake place escape of work to the third countries.
*Usted has been Vice-president under my Presidency and the that have followed, and has won in this house a big appreciate by work, first like Vice-president, especially in the delicate votes, but also, of very ancient, by his #european commitment, that *nos has carried to collaborate in tasks and claims.
His big energy after #one *Europa free and joined politically, respect to the democratic institutions, creed in Parliament that keep at last a strong relation, conscious and transparent with the Commission, no *nos leave more that expect some years in that at last the *asociacionismo of *antaño remain *relegado to the past and begin a true collaboration among #all the Groups of Parliament.
Lady Speaker, in name of the Group of the Green\/ European Free Alliance, wanted to *sumarme to term that *usted has fixed so that the second inform of the Wise persons was in hands of #all members of the European Parliament before 30 August, is to say, before they give beginning audiences with the new Commission.
The Federal Government German #would have wished, of course, greater progresses in #some fields, as for example in the Agricultural Politics, field in the that it will be indispensable to tackle very prompt new reforms with reason of the round of the *OMC, but in spite of #all commitment in group constitutes a very fine base, an extraordinary base for the entrance of the Union in the century *XXI.
Under the Presidency #german of the Council was foreseen transposition of Diary 2000, an ambitious project of reform, with the end to deepen integration of *Europa and prepare to the EU for enlargement to the East by means of some substantial reforms.
Gentleman President, the Greens think that during the century *XXI paper of the no violent methods for conflict solution #would have to be more important that the of the military interventions and that strength, that *excepcionalmente #can be necessary, only exerted previous mandate of the UN.
The #european public has lost confidence in the national authorities and #european attendants of control of medicines and of food control; no longer *fía neither of the Government neither of the Governments neither neither of scientists.
This precise goal a strong synergy among the Commission and Parliament, Parliament that has the democratic representation of the #european citizens and that, therefore, has to offer a fundamental contribution to reforms of the #european Institutions.
The increase of the sessions to open doors of the Council, the facilitation of access to the documents and the publication of meeting diary and of agendas of the different committees and commissions boost of concrete form the principle of transparency.
With regard to the process against *Öcalan: the Commission shares the opinion issued on 29 June by the Presidency #german of the Council after the Court of Security of State condemned to death to *Abdulah *Öcalan and expresses again his basic rejection to death pity.
So my question to President in exercise of the Council and to the Commission is the following: until how point have *meditado in depth on the political measures and the economic and financial commitments that result necessary to build a Serbian free and democratic and *reintegrar the Serbian free and democratic to the economy and the political body Europeans?
In look *me #one to postures here presented pleading by security of defenders of freedom of expression and also to reflections on the different means with the that we #can contribute to the materialisation of freedom of expression in the country in question.
And no are only to Commissioner that has had an unacceptable behaviour, are of an ancient member of this Assembly, a distinguished member of parliament that went even president of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, of a #ex minister of Economy of *Alemania and of Commissioner with a long leaf of services.
Believe that *cuando #this *perseverantes colleagues resolve in this case that has posed in front of the Court of Justice, and advance to events failing without celebrating dress #any that are in front of a clear rape of the object of article 213 and that withdraw to man pension rights, *arrogarán function that competes to the courts.
To the talk of pollution of dioxin it is necessary to say that investigations of the #belgian authorities and inspections of the Commission indicate that pollution produced when adding substance no adapted in manufacture process.
Before happening to treat the approach agreed in the Agriculture Council wanted to *recordarles the effective and timely performance set up by the Commission and supported by the Permanent Committee of Veterinary Medicine of the countries members, performance by the that established #all exception measures required by the principle of prevention.
Expect that it bear #this *Bélgica #can have solidarity of the Union, because it is clear that no matters #if a crisis like #this have been caused by illness, by accident or even by a criminal act. To consumer, to agriculturalist or to company that have been the victim *le will give the same.
Therefore, States members have to give, or have to go back to give, to the Commission, a clear and firm mandate so that #this was the spur of #one *renegociación intelligent of the rules of the *GATT, that today day constitute obstacle to the application of the principle of caution in the sanitary and alimentary fields.
Have to be able to say, as it takes the motion of the Socialist Group, that has to *imperar the principle of legality, that are a Community of Right, and that unless we take a universal application of #this, it that never took with the derivative rule of the *EEB, the situation will not be able to improve.
To hour to evaluate the situation, consider decisive to have of a more global vision of the question, #as well as treat to find solutions that, in the field of elasticity of the structure, #can *evidenciar #some looks related with the problems of these territories of the south of #Italia.
Without embargo, #if *usted reads the Regulation will check that in paragraph 6 of article 170 says that the constitution of the mixed commissions -that they are *algo distinct to the delegations *interparlamentarias-, is to say, that the constitution of the mixed commissions with the countries associated has to make under conditions that the constitution of the commissions.
In taking of this decision, the Commission took into account the fact that no existed any previous decision of the Commission neither precedent of the Court of Justice that served of reference in the case of the *CFO with regard to sale politics of entrances.
Given the circumstances, therefore, is not #willing, gentleman Commissioner, to recognise that fans to football will think that fine of 1.000 euros is absolutely ridiculous -that it is it that paid roughly in the #black market by entrance for the party *Inglaterra-Argentinian-, that the *revendedores of entrances will think that it is a fine news and that the true fans to football will feel disappointed?
Believe that #if #this had produced in the sector of telecommunications or in any #another, the idea that we went back with a symbolic fine in circumstances in that #some have increased benefits in 200 or 300 millions of pounds #would have been so ridiculous as *le seems to fans to football the symbolic fine.
In effect, continues the Commission of Constitutional Subjects: "constitution statement of this Group, in particular the annex 2 of constitution letter, directed to President of the European Parliament, excludes #all political affinity.
will Correspond to the new Commission establish a deeper assessment of this second inform and, to this *respecto, the responsible Vice-president of reform of the Commission, Mr. *Kinnock, will answer along the debate to the most concrete points that pose to the future.
For frustration of #that of the Commission and of this Assembly that have promoted reform, and finish to listen to Mr. *Dell'#Alba, advances that have made until moment have been sporadic and no *preconcebidos and have not been put in practice like consequence of the management of change program.
do not want to anticipate the debate of Thursday, but wanted to say already with clarity that, for example, the relative discussion to the creation of Reconstruction Agency in *Kosovo aims in this direction so much regarding the juridical situation as regarding the administrative structures that have foreseen.
Is necessary to remember, for example, that only four States have ratified the Agreement of the European Union on cooperation in the fight against fraud in the European Union and that in these moments, therefore, there #be not juridical foundation to struggle against fraud.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the report (To5­0003\/99) of Mrs. *McKenna, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer on decision proposal of the Council by the that establishes a community frame of cooperation in matter of accidental marine pollution.
After having doubted a bit, *me have left to convince by the arguments of Mrs. #Jackson to fix in a directive some minimum criteria for the environmental inspections and no limit to the proposal of the European Commission of a recommendation no *vinculante.
colleagues also have formulated questions on the suitability to separate competition #ex in front of on the budgetary control of competition #ex *post on the application or formulation of the budget in breast of the Commission.
Think mainly in a statement that has taken State ambassador Joined takes #some days in front of the European Union in the that cheers that work group *biotecnológico of transatlantic economic association have got to agreement project on the approval processes of new varieties *transgénicas.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, the long path for the nomination #be to finish: finishes a period agitated from the point of institutional sight of life of the Union, a period that has allowed to Parliament express potentialities and reaffirm with conviction his democratic vocation.
Gentleman President designated of the Commission, have valued statement regarding enlargement of the European Union and reform of the Institutions, #as well as the consolidation and the economic growth of #all the Union, and the sustainable development to create new places of work.
#If we want to recover confidence of citizens and citizens need transparency in relation with the execution of the budget of the EU in #all details, felt of responsibility in the handle of bottoms of the taxpayers and budgetary efficiency in the application of the community politics.
Mrs. *Diamantopoulou, #whose wallet also includes equality of opportunities, in addition to employment and the social dimension, has given samples of a big commitment but, how will be able to act, gentleman *Prodi, #if *usted already the has gagged of entrance and has left in hands the fight against violence and discrimination?
Lady Speaker, like the previous orators, believe that the creation of a judicial space European, by part, and instauration of general norms for control of immigration, by #another, in mood #any will solve the problems of delinquency *transfronteriza neither of immigration.
Has to conclude , as, that independently of the question that treat, already was asylum, immigration, the migratory flows, *Europol or the Letter of the fundamental rights, exists a direct relation among each #one of the #european citizens and interest subject.
Lady Speaker, after the problem of work, the most urgent demand that the #european citizens formulate to the community Institutions is the to face up to security need that, by characteristics, #can not be resolved *autónomamente by each #one of States members.
It only that pretend to say with #this is that to the *traspasar competitions to level determined logically also have to move the legal obligations and the own competitions of the parliamentary cooperation #as well as the rights of corresponding decision to level that it treats because, of it contrary, #would create a legal gap and member of parliament.
In *Tampere will give also political orientations on delicate questions, like immigration politics, that require a new approach of relations North-South; like the free circulation, that requires a true harmonisation of politics in matter of granting of visas in *Europa; like asylum right and the right to health for #all refugees.
time begun the process to achieve some minimum rules, #can combine with terms, creating like this strength that promote to the achievement of a reliable juridical field, which is a requirement so that citizens #can circulate freely, with security and confidence, but also to create guarantees of security to hour of enlargement.
Finally, because it takes of the public relief of this new #european space stone of touch of confidence of citizens without reducing the problem to the traditional controversy "freedom against security", but that recognises the magnitude of the new imperative and worries #whose resolution expect of *Europa the #european citizens.
The Council expressed the day before yesterday his deeper indignation in front of performance and also in front of attempts that they have been object so much citizens of *Timor Oriental, like the workers of humanitarian organisations, the representatives of Church and defenders of the human rights.
Also is very stimulating the wish of Mr. *Prodi to boost enlargement of the Community, to give the maximum priority to the creation of places of work, and to work in narrow collaboration with Parliament in the Conference *Intergubernamental.
But in reality, am optimistic because I believe that #one #can familiarise quite well with this matter, in spite of the words of #some of colleagues that compare Budget Commission with livestock market, giving to understand that resources move of side for #another and that sometimes documentation is worse prepared that the that presents in any municipal assembly.
Alas government has had friends in Parliament during years and years, and governments of the European Union have given priority to lucre of armament industries concerning the fundamental human rights of the miserable village of *Timor oriental.
*Me gives the impression of that *él, to the equal that the spokesman of delegation, Mr. *Galeote, has diverted question turn to the Council to take an unacceptable personal disqualification to colleague that has expressed political opinions entirely respectable.
Estimated gentleman *Korakas, *cuando get to the questions that has decided to answer in common, *yo *le will give an explanation, but have to follow order, have to respect order so that the session #can have a good end and *yo am not had to consent that it have more previous questions or of order that prevent the normal operation of question turn.
since the ideas on the Union are so different and that interpretations of Colony decisions are so contradictory in different places of the Union, #can not say then clearly that "yes, are to a common defence" or well "no, no will have a common defence" ?
In October of 1998, the Council requested to the Presidency that proposed common positions, according to article *K.3 of the *TUE, in relation with the Convention project of Nations Joined and Protocols. Of way, the Council pretended to contribute to negotiation and avert contradictions among the future convention and the community instruments.
To be the case, has taken already the Presidency in exercise the initiative to inscribe point in the agenda of the General Assembly of the next autumn or has intention to take it in the next days with arrangement to modalities of procedure?
The Council has decided recently continue politics in this sense in type of forums *multilaterales and present for the first time resolution project for death pity in the session *nº 54 of the General Assembly of Nations Joined.
Gentleman President, the Council has taken postures in diverse occasions on negotiations in matter of the world-wide trade and in reference to the " Round of #Millenium" ; the last time, in the conclusions of the meeting of the Council of General Subjects, the 21 and 22 June 1999.
*Ello #would improve paper of Parliament, that already receives a quarterly report on activities of the agency and has the important mission to approve the management of the director of the agency in the application of the budget.
#can reinforce perfectly collaboration in the civil and penal subjects there #where was necessary, respecting fully tradition of the International and Civil right, the democratic rights, ensuring the traditional principles of the material right and of the procedural right.
Thus, the Commission has made, and will follow making, profitable efforts to help to *Rusia in his arduous transition by means of actions as it is to centre the technical assistance in the fight against money bleaching and crime organised, and support efforts to advance in right state in general.
Lamentably, neither in the agreement *Kumanov concluded among NATO and the #yugoslav Government neither neither in the resolution of the UN that has awarded the mandate for the international presence in *Kosovo, mentions with an alone word the situation of the #albanian prisoners in *Belgrado and of the missing.
Is necessary to recognise, gentleman President, that building has an important structural defect: in relation with building of *Bruselas supposes for deputies decrease of dispatches, no by the square metres that #can have of less dispatch but by the fact that they have to share it in #all activities with assistant.
Affected by a crisis of the *cual *ellos are not the cause and of the *cual neither control consequences, agriculturalists #belgian expect on the other hand that the #european solidarity concretise, that this crisis of dioxins recognise like *epizootia, to level that the crisis of cows crazy" in Big *Bretaña.
On this subject have a Green Book, go to have a White Book and 800 directives, but bottom of the question, the reality, is that #this is a consequence of politics and the decisions *economicistas that have taken in *Europa, and of globalisation.
Besides, the inept form to tackle these questions by part of the respective governments and of the own EU has undermined gravely the public confidence in the capacity of politicians to tackle these crisis in chain alimentary.
Memory, afterwards that #others, that budget project of 2000 foresees a spectacular fall of help, a reduction of two thirds of commitment credits that will happen of 16,5 to 5,5 millions of euros, in the same moment in that it that imposes is precisely a reinforcement of the international mobilisation.
Some better statistical and a better knowledge by part of the rest of the world of it bad that is the situation #can be #some of factors that increased understanding of our populations about the need to make greater efforts in favour of *África, also in the general plane. As this problem is related with the grave situation of *África.
The review of the financial perspectives is in any case *algo significant also by reasons and is related totally with *aquello in that it founds the question of reasons of finance, is to say, that war of *Kosovo has caused a situation that is surprising and new, for the that had not taken reservations in the financial forecasts.
Wanted to also, in my first appearance in front of this Assembly, insist once again in *algo that already took in the Commission, and is in the need to establish the best possible relations among my responsibilities in the Commission and managers of this Assembly in the corresponding subjects.
The amendment 3, especially time adopted work document of services of the Commission on takeoff campaign, that has been transmitted to Parliament and to the Council, no only accepts but that the Commission *les gives graces and the receives with big satisfaction.
Gentleman President, #would wish to go back to congratulate to Mr. *Langen by contribution to the continuation and consolidation of program *ALTENER, since no it is necessary to forget that program is our main instrument, although no financial, to carry out the strategy of the European Union on the renewable energies.
This intellectual political-isolation, the economic sanctions and the material outlay every time greater that demanded the maintenance of the old order finished conducting to the economic stagnation and to the political recognition that this situation #can not continue.
Is of common sense that #if this agreement was ratified by the national parliaments #whose main function, and say it among parenthesis, is once again verified, country third #can use origin denomination controlled #european with the end to negotiate afterwards a financial transaction.
After a meeting among the two parts, celebrated to September beginning, the European Union considers that the agreement has that the #south african do not have to follow using denominations "Port" and "Sherry" after the period established of twelve years, by it that it is necessary, from this time on same, think in substitutive names for the #south african products that it treats.
Expect sincerely that this agreement, seen from the concrete angle of cooperation for development, contribute to the eradication of poverty and the promotion of prosperity in *Sudáfrica with full respect of the democratic principles and the fundamental human rights.
But finish of *decirle, #if Government or #another -sure enough, no only affects to #Grecia: have produced catastrophes or shaken of diverse intensity in countries, but of lower gravity- now well, #if #such or *cual Government requests it, *nosotros #can help and fund with charge to the Structural Bottoms prevention studies that #would allow to know the existent risk in places inhabited, as it mentioned *usted same in question, but also for factories, with the secondary risks of industrial catastrophe that *ello #would involve.
My question based in a visit that took three weeks ago to *Belgrado and in renewed contacts that took the past week with the democratic strengths, with #all the political parties in the opposition, with humanitarian organisations, etc. that sent signals of help to counter the bad image of the rest of the world that propagates *Milosevic.
The Commission asked also to his Scientific Committee of Veterinary Measures related with the Public Health that issued a *dictamen on the possible negative effects for the human health of the administration of the six hormones with seen to intensify growth of animals.
Before the case *Öcalan nobody put in cloth of trial the optimum relations with State that always had declared will to keep an increasingly narrow cooperation with the Community until point to ask adhesion to #the same.
Precisely the military line invariably hard of *Ankara in front of the question *kurda, in spite of call to dialogue by part of the PKK that includes renunciation to the fight armed, underlines utility and need to contrast the situation with evaluation criteria.
*Me pleases to inform, therefore, that President *Arafat has backed the report #make recently on the strengthening of the #palestinian institutions, elaborated by an independent operative group sponsored by the Council of External Relations with an important help of the European Union.
The political benefit of the genetic investigation for humanity sees gravely eroded by the interests created, that take an use of technology that is not compatible with the sustainable development, and that often goes in in conflict with the acceptable ethical norms.
To hour to examine these fields, is especially important that analyse the problems that will have to surpass in these sectors: for example, growth index that at present is of the 13% in the EU, it that shows the capacity and the scope of the regulation negotiated; #as well as complexity.
Believe that #if we develop our own agricultural production, States members of the Union will be competitive in the sector, perhaps no so much in prices, but it is necessary to take into account the quality and also the fact that the importance of the autochthonous production grows increasingly among consumers.
For example: for #one of the main producers of tomatoes of Big *Bretaña that at present pays 363.000 pounds by gas consumption and 60.000 pounds by electricity consumption, the introduction of tax proposed of the climatic change in Big *Bretaña #would increase receipt of the light in 149.000 pounds.
Call attention of colleagues on the danger that supposes for the credibility of Parliament the excessive utilisation of urgency procedure, especially *cuando treats, as in this case, to examine a text elaborated by an external organism.
In what it refers to function of the Commission, wanted to *recalcar that up to now, basing in Article 296, States members have exempted to arm trade of the field of application of norms of the Treaty, it that has prevented intervention of the Community.
To request of the Council, the Commission is a communication on congestion and delays of the aerial traffic and there #be not doubt that it will occupy of this question again and will propose initiatives in the sphere of the management of the aerial space.
Without wanting to *adelantarme to the decision of the Assembly, call attention on the fact that the Conference of Presidents has included point in the agenda of Friday because Thursday is foreseen a meeting of experts on said subject.
Lady Speaker, to end to avert misunderstanding and ambiguity regarding functions and respective competitions of an Institution like the European Parliament and of an Office as it is the *OLAF, wish to underline that so much in the *quinto considering as in the separated second of article 1 affirms without shadow of doubt that have *salvaguardado and respected fully disposals of the Treaties in general and, in particular, of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities.
#would Have to *habernos surprised -since #this no exists in democracies parliamentary- the fact that deputies of the Assembly chosen #can be controlled by organ that depends in greater or in lower measure of the executive, and although, in this case, the *OLAF is controlled by a committee of independent control, is directed by manager designated by the Commission.
The #another subject very important in budget project is the strengthening of resources of the Court of Justice of the EU, that results especially visible in the improvement of the conditions of utilisation of translation services.
After measures, is to expect that the Court #can execute much better work, reduce the number of texts no translated and serve with greater efficiency to States members, citizens and companies, in interpretation and the application of the community legislation.
The Commission proposes that the necessary bottoms fund, in the first place, by means of redistribution inside #the same *rúbrica of measures of external politics, second, using a minimum part of flexibility reservation and, in *tercer place, by means of redistribution among politics in the different fields, which will force to modify the financial perspectives.
The Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary (*ECON) considers that this effort follows being an absolute priority of politics and that still it is necessary to make a big work until they put in circulation notes and coins in the European Union.
And it is necessary to remember also that the Council of *Berlín approved the financial perspectives after an extraordinarily complicated consensus, with some initial positions very distant among the Governments and, besides, with a European Commission resigned and a European Parliament at the end of term of office.
By #this, the Group of the Popular Party European has commissioned a study that examine the possibilities to organise the promotion of personnel and task assignment in services, for the ends of our own administration.
Therefore, is possible to continue the promotion of quality products without asking supplementary costs, and thus I ask to the Commission that do not detain the promotion of quality products, since after #this find difficult regions, products of earth and entry of our familiar exploitations.
Now well, manifest my total concordance with the speaker #Jean-#Louis *Bourlanges -to the that congratulate by the quality of work- regarding the obligation that in the budget for the year 2000 attend important needs recently arisen in the field of category *IV, "external Actions", without putting in *entredicho #others previously formulated, as it pretends to take the Council.
In the Annual Report of #ECB takes exhibition detailed so much of the preparatory work end made by the *SEBC in #day of the introduction of coin only as of the main economic events and monetary occurred in the European Union in 1998 and in the first weeks of 1999.
Is reason of special satisfaction for me that President have gone back to highlight today that the Central Bank European also contemplates the protection of consumer like an important task in the frame of the Monetary Union.
Now well, #if I know to read well the Treaty of the European Union, treats of an essential element of the balance looked for by #that that have set up the Economic and Monetary Union, with hit that know had account of conditions of the step to the euro on 1 January of this year.
Knows *usted that this institution has shown with clarity the will to exert fully competitions that *le awards the Treaty; has biased to hear to each #one of members of directory, gathers with *usted regularly and takes of appointment, in day of today, point *culminante of performance.
Finally, want to take advantage of the presence of the Commission in this debate to remember *algo that also has been repeated many times by Parliament and that, anyway, is very important for Group: the economic politics do not finishes in coin, do not finishes in the monetary politics.
The other way around, has worked well in cases and agree in that it is necessary *presionar with the end that they establish the formal democratic structures external and is in point #where members of parliament -so prompt as it have produced- will be the fundamental agents, also in the civil society.
do not pretend the creation of a rigid system and the special character, the capacity to act and identity of THROW like #such, are an all that consider important to avert that I THROW, in so much an organisation of humanitarian aid, involve in the heavy machinery of taking of decisions of the Commission in general.
Expect with interest the creation of organism that will have to elaborate the letter of fundamental rights and #would be suitable that was chaired by representative of Parliament and that present a document that confer direct rights to citizens of the EU and *les allow, like individuals, exert rights in the European Court.
Is necessary to take more *solidario the social model European, so that it was in conditions to warn marginalisation and to boost the independent establishment of persons, #as well as to promote equality of opportunities for #all citizen groups, also for immigrants.
Without embargo, the Council do not has brave to get to an agreement on development of a common system European of asylum and of bottom for refugees, #such as they had proposed the European Parliament and the Commission and no *limitarnos simply to a convergence of norms and of procedures.
*Me concerns that, simultaneously to the common norms, have not posed effective measures of solidarity among States members *cuando like this demand it the need to answer to situations of urgency, as in the case of the massive flow of citizens #albanian and of the *Balcanes to #Italia as a result of the political crisis of countries.
In the first place, concerning the calendar, this reform -*permítanme, *Señorías, *expresarles my conviction- is the last occasion for a true reform before the big enlargement of the Union, before the meeting of States and of the #european villages in a big political community and economic.
Proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the relative Council to approximation of legislations of States members on the leading protection against the *empotramiento of engine vehicles and by the that modifies the Directive 70\/156\/*CEE of the Council (*COM(1999) 32 - *C4-0094\/1999 - 1999\/0007(*COD)) (Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market)
(Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that amends the Directive 92\/61\/*CEE of the relative Council to the reception of engine vehicles of two or three tyres (*COM(1999) 276 - *C5-0012\/1999 - 1999\/0117(*COD)) (Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market)
contradiction results frankly ridiculous in the case of the #french Government, that *subscribió in the Treaty of *Amsterdam the financial and physical distribution of refugees among the countries of the Union and now retreats in front of the consequences of his own signature.
Finally, taking loaned time proposed and ideas of the report *Gillenhammer, have to say that I am had to send a letter to #all companies with more of 1.000 persons, to #european level, *pidiéndoles that elaborate, voluntarily, a report titled "directing change" to take form of *benchmarking among the own great companies on how #can foresee restructurings without creating great social problems and grave.
Finally, the #european socialists insist so that it review the #european directive on the creation of a committee of #european company, so that it facilitate an authentic information to employees, in a normal and timely term, and celebrate queries for real, it that supposes that they concede half sufficient storms and means of *peritaje autonomous for employees.
How felt has affirm that the benefits of *Michelin went up in a 17%, without saying #if they are greater or minors that the of *Bridgestone or of *Goodyear or of the competitors, without saying that *Michelin is company with turnover of 106 dollars by worker, against the 141 of *Goodyear, without saying that *Renault that, #if no *me *equivoco is company taken part mostly by the #french Government, goes to *Japón, buys company *Nissan and, for no *cerrarla, sees forced to sack to 21.000 workers that, without embargo, when being #japanese, *nos interest less.
Is to say, that the *margen was very reduced and, therefore, #can be useful -and without place to doubts will be useful- that Parliament take to hear voice after the of Government Bosses, that, in *Tampere, regretted attitude of Senate #american, when underlining that it constituted -quote- "an inopportune signal for those who seat the temptation to endow of the nuclear weapon".
And in the Union, in #where #all have ratified prohibition Treaty of the nuclear proofs, have political arguments and morals for *dirigirnos to our American partners and *recordarles that have the grave responsibility to treat to stabilise the world and that have help #if truly it #can collaborate with *ellos.
look that have to argue with *ellos, and that remains reflected in article that quoted his *Señoría, gentleman *Elles, is that the unilateral character that today defend #some Republican, although no #all, to take justice to Senator *Logan, corresponds to politics of "only *nosotros" , for quoting the historical lemma Irish, and that #would result so disastrous for the world as it went it after the First World-wide War.
Need to boost there values of tolerance and of respect to the cultural diversity and to freedom of villages to decide democratically future and promote coexistence, solidarity, the sense of justice and peace.
*Me take echo of the words of Mr. *Gargani *cuando say that #all the subjects on the that have treated tonight in the Assembly try to guarantee that culture was considered a priority; is to say, no only, for example, that the euro or work places and employment will guarantee hit of the #european project.
The Commission is convinced that the participation of *Turquía in programs allocated first of all to youngsters, programs of exchange and meetings that strengthen the civil society, democracy and respect of the human rights, will favour understanding and understanding among villages and cultures.
And like this suited, but here are of another question, #this is, that presented a resolution proposal in the *cual appeared, in his last point, a question almost of courtesy, and is that it went to remit the resolution to president of company, and it that happens is that transaction resolution that presented carried this name.
Like this as, #if it approves this commitment, will be necessary to vote the comment of line *B1-4050, amends 507, with a favourable opinion of Budget Commission and by means of vote by parts, requested by the Group of the Greens, #as well as the comment of line *B1-406 on the amendment 69, time by means of nominal vote.
In sense, *nosotros #can not accept the proposal of the Council to operate a reduction of the 10% of credits assigned to cooperation and to development to fund reconstruction of *Kosovo, #as well as help to *Turquía, after the earthquake, or even help to *Timor Oriental.
worker is called, with gun of unemployment in temple, to show *solidario with benefit increase and accept agreements *humillantes regarding the terms, conditions and wages, as in the case of *MICHELIN, to finish losing definitively work place.
Lady Speaker, first of all, give the thanks to Commissioner *Fischler by intervention, and *le remember that Wednesday of the next week expect that President *Prodi or Commissioner *Byrne avenge to Parliament to take a statement about measures that the Commission thinks to adopt after the publication of the scientific conclusions known to last hour of today.
Ask to Commissioner *Fischler that, *cuando School gather next Wednesday, present immediately a proposal to create the European Alimentary Agency because, in my opinion, to have existed already organism, the current discrepancy never #would have arisen.
Are #all of agreement in that the subjects of the alimentary security and the public health have to be the maximum political priority in #all *Europa, but meat of bovine #british, #such as it has declared it today Commissioner *Fischler, respects the goals of the public health established by the European Union.
It that, by the contrary, seems timely and desirable is that they take advantage of occasions to restart organisation work of the community Institutions, of the *cual Parliament, in virtue of the mandate of #all Europeans that represents, has to take load integrating paper exerted up to now by the national Governments in construction community.
No only are and establishing competition level, but that, besides, *revestiría considerable importance determine clearly and signal the jurisdiction that the agency of alimentary security #would have in the community level and #which #would be his reciprocal effects with the agencies in level of States members.
Finally, #would suit *usted *conmigo in that, although it existed -repeat, existed, in subjunctive- the agency that wishes to create Mr. *Prodi and that still has not examined thoroughly in this House, even in this case #can repeat #one and time this same situation, as obviously they #would follow existing the national Agencies, that in any moment #can affirm that they have of new scientific data, so that hope that said agency allow to avert situations like #this is a mere illusion?
Of course, have taste in giving explanation in relation with *eso, but have to remember to His *Señorías *algo that -am sure- know: do not take exports of meat of bovine elaborated with arrangement to export plan according to a calendar established from Realm Joined, because in the first place it is necessary determine and approve facilities for end and the authorities of Realm Joined no the have proposed.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, in name of the Liberal Group, support this initiative that consider very timely to ensure the necessary consensus in the economic and social field, absolutely indispensable to achieve the climate of stability, growth and greater occupation in the European Union.
Is essential that look for new and -better forms- with seen to the achievement of the goal of a balanced and sustainable development of mood that satisfy our needs and the of the environment and that do not have negative repercussions in the levels of life of the poor regions of the world.
Is to say, on the one hand, bankers, Economy Ministers and associations of industrial, and by #another Work Ministers and the social speakers in the field of the unions, debate, and situate in the centre of the common politics the subject of employment.
In spite of #everything, the sector of transport in whole, the maritime activities and activities of doctors in period of training remain excluded of the field of application of directive relative to ordination of work time of 1993.
Like speaker, have looked for a balance no only among directive proposal of the Commission, the first reading of Parliament and the common position of the Council, but, especially, among security and health so much of workers as of the remaining parts involved.
treats, therefore, to limit the length of work time to protect security and health in place of work, especially in the distinct sectors of transport, the maritime activities and doctors in period of training.
Regarding it that today has posed with the amendment *nº 10, that is *algo that finishes to get to hands, #would say that, by the first introduction that have of collaborators, seems that article 17, section 2 the include; But to be able to be clearer and treating of a first approximation, believe that for morning will be able to have a final answer on the subject of this amendment.
The agreement will allow to the two parts explode #all the potential linked with investigation capacities advanced of the countries in roads of durable development, as it has underlined, but also, as they #can appreciate His *Señorías, in the sphere of the concrete program "Energy-environment", in the sphere of the renewable energies, had account of commitments of *Kyoto.
According to my experience, in the last five years, lamentably, the legislative norms on concrete looks of the only market always have debated in way Assembly *fragmentaria, for saying it like this, without contemplating #all links and interrelationships with other legislative subjects.
Of course, in Group want that attainment of the Inner Market comport a balance -as it has said *usted same, gentleman Commissioner- among market freedom and the need to protect the environment, health and confidence of consumers.
Finally, from sight point of the active politics in matter of market of work, training and *recualificación, lines guidelines #all *ellas important, *me seems insufficient convergence level in reliable indicators of efficiency of politics inside the national plans of employment, in that dimension of the community Institutions is anyway linked to controls of hit and of result.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, believe that it is intelligent and forced initiate this brief contribution to the debate on the guidelines of employment *felicitándonos #all by the fine data that offers the #european reality and appreciating work of #all the that have *empeñado it better of intelligence in taking possible the that, at last, #can have coordination process in matter of employment, as it signals article 128 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Now well, in relation with the of the report *Dimitrakopoulos, *Leinen, so that at least it #can have intervention by group in a so important report, *yo #would propose that in this case suppressed question turn to the Council, with which #all the groups #can express , because it is a very important question for Parliament.
end date of the 2002 #would allow to the Commission take a total assessment of the effects of the new cycles of proofs type of approval, that will introduce from the next year for the regulation of particle broadcasts *contaminantes of the new #european vehicles.
Want to manifest that the amendments numbers 3 and 5 go to be substituted by new amendments that modify the considering 18 and articles 5, 6 and 7 to adapt the text that present to the editorial that has elaborated the Conciliation Committee #Socrates and that goes to suppose a horizontal solution for the committees in the majority of programs.
Without embargo, my Group has approved it with great objections and only because the Council has recognised and has used like foundation the definition of the World-wide Organisation. of Health , according to the *cual health concept has to be considered like state of full corporal welfare, spiritual and social, and no only like the absence of illness and of weakness.
The Commission will study attentively the reports of this debate, and will undertake the necessary action to satisfy worries of Parliament, no only to celebrate the *décimo anniversary of the Convention but also to improve concrete politics, to end to fulfil with the goals established in this Convention.
Is of the opinion that the Presidency #finnish and, *eventualmente, the following, the Presidency #portuguese, have worry that, for example, Big *Bretaña will happen to the field enemy in dispute on copartnership rights of workers in the #european anonymous society?
But since there #be delay, that already has regretted, expect that time of delay use *constructivamente, and that the Council and the Commission, and also Parliament, *reflexionen on form to put things it better possible in it that definitely is a key sphere.
mood to proceed of the Council with income of the European Union is not as very serious -it that formulate of a very soft mood- and, in front of the next process of enlargement, #can convert in an authentic mortgage that *nos prevent development possibilities.
On a long-term basis, has to exist a direct relation among finance of costs of the Union and citizens and to #that that now shout again gone up " of taxes ", *les say incidentally that tax charge and similar #can not increase in total for citizens and citizens and that #this is the position that already adopt in March.
Besides, are of the opinion, and *eso already had put it of self-evident with anteriority the Commission of same Budgetary Control, that it is necessary that believe reservations in costs allocated to the European Bottom of Orientation and of Agricultural Guarantee, to be able to face up to the unforeseen costs.
Firstly, is essential that the current disequilibriums of the budgetary participations because of discounts that perhaps explain historically dismantle of gradual way, progressive, but *pertinaz and that the contributions of country adapt to his just measure from the point of sight objective and countable.
In the summit of the Council of *Berlín agreed modifications for part of income in it *tocante to the maximum proportion of taxes on value added that it delivers to the Union, in it *tocante to discount in the #british contribution and finance and in it *tocante to proportion of the *gravámenes agricultural and *aduaneros that States members #can retain.
Gentleman President, believe that the report that are, with proposals, #such as #this took form in Budget Commission, contributes to the creation of a half balanced, austere and effective to reinforce the budgetary discipline that it is subject of #all and #whose application guarantees only with the essential collaboration of the institutions and, of course, with collaboration of States members.
In it *tocante to the question of #if costs that are foreseen in the frame of enlargement for the agricultural sector will be sufficient, definitely will be necessary to observe continuously how evolves the situation in States candidates to adhesion and of how supposed has split in *Berlín for assessment of the necessary costs.
Without embargo, want to remember that Parliament or the Union in general have developed during the years happened the procedure *Nootenbom until point that credit transfers to finals of year were almost impossible to see with clarity. Thus, have insisted in this budget *rectificativo and supplementary to reach like this a greater transparency.
In addition to the report of Mrs. *Dührkop, have heard before how have debated the subjects of the own resources, of the budgetary discipline, and the truth is that it swims of #everything *ello *redundaría in benefit of the taxpayer #if we did not advance in efficiency of the fight against fraud.
have exposed three goals: first, promote the energetic efficiency; second, increase the participation in production of the energetic sources less *contaminantes -the dip is the 12% of renewable in the year 2010-; third, reduce the environmental repercussions of production and the utilisation of energetic products.
Have taken investments to increase the use of sources of renewable energy and have declared our firm purpose to take into account the requirements of a stable energetic economy inside an enlargement process.
Commissioner *Byrne, declared it following in appearance: the future of politics in matter of public health do not have to circumscribe to the crisis of moment, that has to have a high level of protection of health in #all the community politics that we have to adopt a preventive attitude in matter of attention of public health.
Am safe that Speaker will have to well write, in name of the European Union, to congratulate to #all parts interested by actions, courage and determination to carry out the peace process and disarmament and am safe that His *Señorías will suit *conmigo in that peace in *Irlanda of the North *infunde hopes to #everyone and everywhere.
will not mention delivery *deshonrosa of an elderly of 90 years of part of Swiss to *Francia, since it treats of a country that is not member of the European Union, but will mention simply legislations increasingly *represivas that pretend to dictate the political and historical speech and of the that do not wish that they #can find favourable terrain to extend of a #european State to #another.
By it that refers to directive proposal, when reducing transmission terms of the judicial acts and *extrajudiciales of a Been member to #another are an instrument that will allow that the judicial processes develop in the best conditions of celerity and juridical security preserving the rights of #all the interested in the causes.
do not aspires only to *subyugar to a proud village that insists in defining freely, *él only, the path of country and the #his own, but that signals, of multiple ways, a self-evident intention of the imperialist Americans to impose will, law in relations and economic and commercial activities international.
On purpose of #this, see by the communiqués of news agencies of this afternoon that, after mission, the World-wide Bank has reckoned that they will need among 260 millions and 300 millions of dollars of the #EE.UU. for reconstruction to half term in #that *Timor Oriental in ruins and that will procure that the majority of bottoms the contribute donors in the conference that will celebrate the next month in *Tokio.
The majority of measures that appear in the annexes *II and *III are very effective to reduce the losses, for example, of resultant phosphorus of agriculture and the future managerial-frame on water the will complete with plan instrument of management in level of the hydrographic basins.
Lady Left Red, am totally of agreement and believe that the conclusions of the European Council of *Tampere underline the fact that it have a horizontal approach among *pilares that cover immigration politics and asylum and the #others political of the European Union, inside the *cuales have help politics to development.
helps gave with condition that companies had a commercial management -and therefore no had a presence of the authorities of the countries or of the administrations of said countries-, that it carried out the suitable process of restructuring and that, at the end, obtained some profitable companies and that they #can develop without need of new public helps.
In the frame of chapter 24 of adhesion negotiations, that refers to cooperation in the fields of justice and internal subjects, treated on controls in the external borders and visa politics of the EU.
do not wish to repeat #all points that so well has posed the High Representative, but had account that I have been invited to take part in this debate, it that *me full of satisfaction, wanted to say some words on the opinion of the Commission with regard to the creation of security politics and #european defence.
But measures that #can adopt with the goal to warn conflict and the human suffering include besides #many things, like watching by fulfillment of the law, the creation of institutions and trade politics.
And #if it remains another evident in the dictionary, is the following: while it follow being manager of the current competitions, neither paper of smoking, or perhaps after the announcement that took yesterday #David *Byrne on tobacco #would have to say paper tissue, will separate to the Commissioner of External Relations of the High Representative.
Understand that his opinion is that yes and, in this case: How opinion *le deserves the decision of the Council of Ministers that, in the first reading of the budget of the year that comes, has reduced the amounts to an inferior level to the of the amounts of the year 1996?
*Usted has referred to the reallocation of resources and to the possibility to have appropriate means Agrees *conmigo in that, in this moment, the reallocation of resources inside the European Union is much more important that pose the increase of the maximum limits of defence?
From 1990, since it came down clash among blocks, has gone back to be possible rid conventional regional wars in *Europa, that open again the doors to the ancient traditional clashes among ethnic groups, to disputes by the outline of borders, etc., and to the resumption of the ancient cycle of violence.
Along #all the Round of #Millenium #would have to can formulate specific recommendations -of compliance with section 5 of article 97 of the Regulation of the European Parliament- that *nos allow to influence on works before the conclusion of the new Agreement, follow development and leave feel properly weight of our opinions.
The seven fundamental norms develop the four human rights basic in work: the right to freedom of organisation and of meeting without fetters, syndication right, the right to not making works *forzosos, the right to enjoy of childhood.
Have enumerated only #some of the essential looks, #whose importance also have signalled in repeated occasions #others and colleagues, because #any of *nosotros will tire to insist in the need that the subjects related with the environment and the protection of consumers debate in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
element reinforces also powers awarded to the Commission in the frame of the proposal in study: the possibility to reduce the amount of the direct helps or to suspend payment of the monthly advances.
Have forced to State Department to trace a strategic map of the possible routes: the most important #would be route among the sea *Caspio and port #turkish of *Ceyahn that affects to axis among *Baku and port #russian of *Novorossijsk.
Although we know that #this will hamper enormously for the European Union conversations and negotiations on the *incumplimiento of the commercial agreement and of the agreement on steel by part of the Russians. terrorism #can not and do not has to combat by means of employment of the military strength against #all village.
Finally, keep the principle of the cultural exception, that recognises the possibility for the Union and States members to preserve capacity to define with freedom his audiovisual cultural politics in name of development of an alive diversity and *enriquecedora.
Expect, finally, that the European Parliament #can exert an active paper in the Round of #Millenium beginning by the previous knowledge of the study of the Commission on impact hypotheses of the effects of the new normative process.
And so that this free trade was a free trade just, is evident that have to conciliate the commercial norms with norms that refer to the protection of the environment, the rights of workers, the agricultural model European or the protection of consumers.
But believe that #if we work joined of an open way with the common goal to improve quality of life of #everyone, will be able to really confuse to critics of globalisation and show that globalisation and liberalisation #can be an authentic decisive strength for sake.
In addition to strengthening in our own continent the legitimacy of performance of the Union, the participation of the global group of the no governmental organisations- #can help to our negotiators to achieve the goals of the Union.
#That to those who concern the human rights, the protection of animals and the environment have some a lot better perspectives to guarantee improvements in said fields inside a juridical frame and in a World-wide Organisation of Trade, that in #one *gresca or law of the jungle.
Gentleman President, in any case and to #all the effects, take to state that I have presented appeal three hours ago, with my signature and the of president of the Liberal Group and with the agreement of President of the Group of the *PPE, although it have not signed.
And #this supposes, among things, that the goal of the new Conference *Intergubernamental has to be the improvement of the previous institutions to the reception of the new members, the improvement of operation mood of the institutions and of the #european politics.
Therefore, that first small reform, in the that only it was necessary to talk of the Commission and of the weighting of the votes in the Council and to the that Colony Statement had added also the possible extension to qualified majority, do not has too much sense, answers to a distinct political logic.
*Nosotros, the Group of the Popular Party European and the European Democrats, #can and want to collaborate in this direction #if the problems of the Report *Napolitano resolve of a reasonable form, and the problems are in the limit of it that *nosotros #can support with vote, #if well we are not in mood #any truly satisfied.
Expect that Parliament brake once again this frontal attack to the Convention of Nations Joined on refugees, to Right Statement of Boy and to the juridical security of citizens of third countries that find inside borders of the Union.
*Cuando convert the Agreement and the Protocol *EURODAC in a community Regulation, modify it so that it was in total consonance with the community legislation on data protection, included the new Article 286 of the Treaty, that fixes protection disposals of data for the community institutions.
The two questions that more seem to have concerned to Parliament are the question of the minimum age for the taking of digital prints and norms for the destruction of data saved in the central base of data.
#If we had to destroy #all data on asylum applicants in what the interested #can benefit of class of juridical condition, the Regulation *EURODAC #would not apply already to the situations in the that asylum applicant receives permission to remain in any #another quality during a brief space of time and, at the end of this period, goes to another Been member and requests asylum in *él.
The debate of today #can, nevertheless, contribute to a better knowledge by part of the House of the increasing threat that constitute drugs, on the real database and no imaginary, and *coadyuvar to the achievement of improvements to short and long term of the critical current situation.
Without more preambles, gentleman President, declare that we agree, that approve the plan of the Commission; have, without embargo, reservations that formulate; reservations, that shares the own Commission, owed to the non-existent evaluation of programs and to the insufficient general approach in relation with the existent real threat. During the last fifteen years, gentleman President, drugs do not constitute simply a threat.
After the European Council of *Tampere it will be necessary to give priority to prevention of the juvenile delinquency, urban and related with drug, and to the gradual harmonisation of legislation of the European Union on traffic of illicit drugs.
Second, the *ORD (Organ of Solution of Differences), created in breast of the *OMC, has demanded of the European Union that renounced to his own norms in fields so fundamental like the sanitary and alimentary security or even to cooperation politics in the question of banana of the countries *ACP and of the regions *ultraperiféricas.
Is necessary to go back to examine disequilibrium situation that gives off of the fact that only the commercial agreements *multilaterales have ended in the creation of organism of judicial nature, *cuando *ello has not been like this neither with regard to the agreements on the environment neither to the of the *OIT.
doubt refers to capacity -and to our real will- to convert to the *OMC in regulation instrument, with the end to happen of globalisation wished by #one #few and suffered by #all to a world-wide trade truly *reglamentado, that benefit to the group of the planet.
With the argument that it is necessary to simplify the application of the Agreement of *Dublín, the Council pretends to repeat previous attempts of *cercenar fundamental rights of citizens of third countries by means of the creation of a mechanism of collected of digital prints controlled by a central unit, that cover no only to refugees and applicants of asylum, but also to #all citizens of third countries that find in irregular situation.
*Nosotros support these efforts of *saneamiento, contributing in activities of two scientific centres and international technicians, the of *Moscú and the of *Kiev, and, #if it was necessary, are had to provide a supplementary help to programs, very understood that, as *ustedes have said it during the debate, are now very near of the step to the year 2000 and that it essential has been to begin to concern thus opportunely.
#If they do not have future, or better said, do not have future #worthy, since "they are enclosed among the #albanian terror in *Kosovo and repulsion and discrimination of countries, with the aggravating that the humanitarian help in the central part of the *Balcanes is to end".
Equally, agree plenary and total support to efforts carried out by the *MINUK, to create an operational civil administration, in conditions to assume #police functions that at present are in hands of *KFOR and to create society *multiétnica peaceful, able to take charge of reconstruction of *Kosovo and of the *restablecimiento of society.
In accordance with previous statements, the European Commission has left very seated that any new judicial formality related with the contribution taken by Mr. *Nikitin to the Report *Bellona has to be in full compliance with the principles and the norms of international acceptance in matter of justice and human rights.
The fact to say that it is intolerable that have boys forced to work in place to go to school, that #can not eat it sufficient, that boys are sold like commodities, that are victims of physical violence or morals by part of adults, is already a big step that, of course, has to translate in our political acts and in our daily life!
By #everything it aforesaid, estimate that this initiative is a step in the fine direction, with utilisation of the modern technology of digitalisation of images with computer to help to organisms commissioned to take fulfil the law and to the ministries of the interior to cooperate in #all the Union.
The debate *nos teaches that all it that collects in approach no *fructifica because the conjoint work of the governments no suffices to take a new legislation in matter of structures of security on the base of the problems that poses the inner market and integration speed that #this involves.
*Yo #would wish that opening principle that has produced in relations with the Bank follow advance and that at the end #can get to a result that was satisfactory for Parliament and for the European Bank of Investments, without forgetting, as it said previously, that the *BEI is a financial institution that it #can give information without subject restriction of #any nature.
Without embargo, as *sucede in #many other areas, reasons that agreements have been awarded to countries like *Corea are surely conditions that in *ellos exist: for example, workers of these countries receive wages very low, have labour conditions and measures of security very deficient and unsatisfactory due to the fact that health and security of workers are not a priority.
Without embargo, seems that now civil servants of the the General Direction of Competition of the Commission have the firm purpose to interpret program in question like help to dockyards, although program do not affects to competitiveness of #the same, since ship that benefit of help will be able to commission in any country.
To finish, wish *preguntarle to gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, how #can be possible for a Been member trace navigation politics, #if it #can not entrust in the instructions given by the Commission How the Commission in his recent correspondence with the governmental authorities has considered adhesion Records of *Finlandia with regard to the mentioned political?.
Lady *Doyle, *le appreciate intervention and have to *decirle that *me have allowed *adelantarme to the wish of His *Señoría and, in name of the European Parliament, already have written to #all the bosses of the main parties *norirlandeses bear *comunicarles admiration that feel by it that have reached and *enviarles our best wishes, the more *calurosos, for the continuation with hit of the peace process.
Without recognition, #some of these countries #can demoralise and *volvernos back: economies #would begin to diverge and advances to democracy and respect of the human rights #would run the risk to detain and #would lose maybe for ever a big historical occasion.
Without embargo, declare with firmness that #if it exists the risk that enlargement conduct to the dissolution or #one *desvirtuación of the European Union, in the sense that we finish being only an economic and financial administration, but no a political Union, #if enlargement comported this risk, then #would have to *rechazarla.
Gentleman President, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, expect that Speaker in exercise of the Council have time to read, before the summit, our resolution on #the same and also the report that approve on the Conference *Intergubernamental the month of November, because I have thrown in fault a bit reflection on #some of the arguments that bear *nosotros are absolutely keys.
The Council *apresta to exclude - like this believe it - of shameful way to the European Parliament of the Conference *Intergubernamental and, especially, has to ensure that the Conference occupy only of three points of functional improvement of the Institutions and, therefore, to leave of the all *inalterado this incomprehensible castle of *naipes that they are the Treaties of the Union.
Finally, want *expresarle to Mrs. Speaker in exercise of the Council my more sincere congratulations because it has achieved, without need to modify rule, thing that had not achieved still, increase clearly transparency in the European Union and, in particular, in the process of taking of decisions of the Council.
Likewise, in front of the multiplication of signing systems (*Europol, *Eurodac), the European Parliament #would have to have reiterated request that it saw the light an independent commission on computing and freedoms to end to preserve our individual freedoms, in addition to the democratic control and *jurisdiccional.
Of the subjects that *nos has exposed the Presidency in exercise of the Council, the subject of the design in the new frame of enlargement do not poses problems neither to Parliament neither to the proposal of the Commission, neither neither to the Council of ministers.
Said communication, that the Commission foresees to adopt in the *primer semester of the 2000, will complete the report of the Council on the human rights, since it will occupy especially of the concrete actions that it #can undertake the Community to promote respect of the human rights in third countries, so as to back our statements and *darles consistency by means of serious and concrete initiatives.
(To5-0070\/1999) of Mr. *Morillon, in name of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence, on regulation proposal of the relative Council to action realisation directed to deepen the Union *Aduanera *CE-*Turquía (*COM(1998) 600 -*C4-0669\/1998 - 1998\/0299(*CNS)).
Without embargo, the Environment Commission do not agrees with the intention of the Commission to concede in mood a cheque in white that allows exceptions without limit. In effect, the proposal foresees that the countries that have it that designates like socioeconomic problems #can request a transitory period of five years, that to continuation #can *prorrogarse other five years more.
*Yo believe that #if we achieve it and the Commission, as I expect, also #can take #his the proposals of our commission, will have marked truly a milestone in the improvement of the quality of the air acclimatise and also will have contributed a lot to leave clear that to substances *carcinógenas no *les has lost at all in the environment.
The proposal taken by the European Commission, reinforced by the report of Mrs. *Breyer, that goes more far, poses the principle of the evaluation and the management of the quality of the air acclimatise by it that refers to two sources *contaminantes important -the *benceno and carbon monoxide- produced the two by circulation by road.
The Commission #can accept the amendment 15 in part and considers that this proposal #would have to adjust to the Directive 1999\/30 inserting the words "in those cases in that it exist more of measurement season in the zone or in the urban core, at least #one has to be situated wall of traffic and at least #another has to be oriented to the urban bottom" .

Already have achieved to open a bit the door, but, frankly, have to signal that the Summit of *Helsinki has not adopted the recommendations made by the Expert Committee, chaired by Mr. *Dehaene and based in the excellent proposals that prepared the European Commission under the direction of Commissioner *Barnier.
#There is #some progresses and the #can analyse with serenity: two representatives of the European Parliament will take part in #all negotiation sessions and will be able to take part to the principle of meeting of the Conference *Intergubernamental; likewise, in meeting of this type will have conversations among President of Parliament and State bosses and of Government.

Understand the constitutional arguments, the political arguments, but try *explicarlos to somebody that *carece of a ceiling on head in *Kosovo, try *explicarlos to pensioner that wants to receive the social subsidy in *Montenegro, try *explicarlos to somebody of the *ARYM that think that the difficult measures that have adopted in country in the last years deserve quite more support of the European Union.
*Nosotros follow keeping offer that already made Parliament, with a #symbiosis of budgetary discipline, on the one hand, and by the #another side, the will to consider cuts very concrete and no linear, as they pretended *ustedes, and to contemplate to time the necessary political priorities and *financiarlas.
On the other hand, President of the Court of Accounts has devoted yesterday, in enclosure, «the persistence of culture of costs in breast of the Community, that is more concerned by the volume of costs that by quality».
Gentleman President, with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam have increased considerably attributions of the European Parliament, that has assumed new powers of *codecisión in the sphere of prevention and the fight against the harmful frauds for the financial interests of the Community.
Therefore, already is hour to finish with tight compartments among the Common Agricultural Politics, the structural Bottoms, the own resources of the Community and his internal and external politics and ensure that it exists an alone weight and an alone measure for #all *ellos.
The decision to carry out visible actions satisfies condition of *evidenciar the positive paper of the European Union regarding demolitions that ten years ago left after himself\/hisself communism and puts to proof goodness of the western democratic system in front of the *fracasado *dirigismo previous.

Gentleman President, the present recommendation invites to Parliament to issue his *dictamen satisfied on the proposal of the relative Council to the technical harmonisation in the sector of car *considerándola an important factor for development of the world-wide market.

Besides, create -and it *deploro- that there #be a big absent in this resolution: are citizens, since we do not have to forget that further of measures that #can take States of the Union, are citizens, consumers, those who, through habits, of behaviours, will induce change and will impose it to managers.
#would Wish that Parliament expressed again reservations express regarding the system of the rights of pollution, the flexibility mechanism, since, #if well we want to resolve the enormous problem of the effect *invernadero, #can not accept this process in that all #can buy or sell and in that they #can buy the rights of pollution.
The abandonment of the nuclear energy #can be conversation subject of the populist in the countries developed of *Europa and in Parliament, of the populist to *ultranza. No exists realistic alternative in place, not even in the countries to the that the Union will expand in the future.
Gentleman President, the Popular Party European has affirmed repeated times that considered fundamental the adoption by part of the Council and of the Commission of a public position before day 20 December, date in that it will produce the transmission of sovereignty of the territory of *Macao to the Popular Republic of Chinese.
The conjoint statement *luso-#chinese -to the that already has referred here Commissioner *Patten- is a fine statement and in *ella appear, in group, the great lines that #can orient the territory of *Macao in the next 50 years like specific zone, with his own specificity inside whole #chinese, is to say, respecting #all legislation that applied the #portuguese in *Macao.

In other words, #if enlargement works, #if program of Diary 2000 reaches to improve the economic situation of the countries of the *Europa central and oriental, *ello will reduce by himself\/hisself same the flow of economic refugees pertinent of said countries to the current States members of the European Union.
Probably, #would fit to indicate still on this subject that #one of the important previous conditions to approve finance of #all projects reviewed and elaborated by the European Bank of Investments is that it take in account the point of ecological sight, and like this took in the case of project *Gardaland.
Is conscious the Council that this problem affects to information that facilitates in the press on the results of the sessions *plenarias of Parliament, since journalists only #can be in spot to time (and usually gives priority to the meetings of the Council in *Bruselas?
The Presidency #finnish demanded to the international community in the session of the 54 General Assembly of the UN that find the solutions and the timely answers to confront the new and unpredictable challenges in the frame of the humanitarian Right.
Gentleman President, prevention and the fight against the illegal traffic of appropriate materials for the construction of atomic arms, bacteriological and chemical is the goal of cooperation among the authorities *aduaneras, judicial and police in the frame of cooperation of the Union in matter of delinquency, goal that tries to reach directly or well through *EUROPOL.
From sight point want to signal that it takes #some days, *cuando in *Helsinki adopted the political decision to expand the European Union, with correction fixed the political criteria of the *Europa of the fifteen, the criteria of *Copenhague, but it is necessary to consider that the new countries candidates to adhesion have problems that up to now the fifteen did not have.
So that citizens have the possibility to control that the application of law by part of the Court of Justice fulfils independence criteria and objectivity, traditionally inherent to the judicial system, #would be necessary that the application of the law occurred with transparency.
#All the that was present in the different commissions during the previous deliberation of the reports *Von *Wogau, *Rapkay, *Jonckheer and *Langen knows until how point competition politics and the future of politics of the inner market *inciden in the future development of the economy, growth and employment of *Europa.
Gentleman President, receive with *beneplácito this opportunity to take a brief contribution to this debate and begin with observation that a prompt and satisfactory solution of controversy on the *inocuidad of foods *reviste paramount importance for consumers, for graziers and, in fact, for the alimentary industry.
The Commission #can not accept the amendment proposed to suppress the requirement of a real debate among Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the main proposal based in article 152 of the Treaty.
Therefore, in Record and in the Literal Record of the session, so much on purpose of intervention on *Macao as in the Literal Record, on purpose of interpellation to the Table with occasion of the resolution on *Chechenia, *yo appear identified like #Luís *Queiró, my colleague that seats in seat 571, and no with my own name, *Ribeiro and *Castro, that *me seat in seat 662.
In my opinion the *primer point is that it underline the importance of trade of the skilled book, that bet by the quality and no by quantity, that need the skilled advice and a special offer of the scientific and skilled bibliography, #as well as service and attention *individualizados.
#If in section 4º of the resolution includes that it will displace a delegation to *Kuwait, also will have to treat the problematic of the local Administration, #as well as the question of the procedure, because it results extraordinarily clumsy that law proposition of #this *envergadura #can not approve by a fault of procedure.
Bottom created to promote the urban and rural development, development of the communities, to increase qualities and to improve the quality of the environment; justifications quoted in the amendments of the Greens are false.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0083\/1999) of Mr. *Xaver *Mayer, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, on regulation proposal (*CE) of the Council that modifies the Regulation (*CEE) 1696\/71 by the that it establishes the common organisation of markets in the sector of the *lúpulo (*COM(1999) 302  *C­0081\/1999  1999\/0128(*CNS))
In my opinion space constitutes the *Balcanes of the future, #one *Balcanes to scale world-wide. And by reason is of vital interest for *nosotros, so much more what that there has seat a series of nuclear powers, stabilise space and prevent that the ethnic conflicts of there have effects especially the world.
Anyway wish to reassure to #all the honourable deputies, to the equal that have taken it with the countries candidates, with certainty that on our part the, *llamémosla, institutional crisis to the that *nos confront in this moment and that of course *repercute also in some sense in work of the Commission, did not has to carry and will not carry to delays in the process of enlargement.
Wanted to conclude saying, also to the own countries candidates to integration, that has been and follow being, also today, our philosophy that has to value country candidate by his own merits and by his own progresses, although #this #can conduct to differentiation, at the same time that it is especially important that leave clear that, while #some in moment determined #can have advanced more that #others, #all family of enlargement will follow being an alone family.
Regarding posture of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and of Industrial Politics ascertain that in bold strokes it shares the opinion of the Commission *cuando #this affirms that the modifications proposed will allow that in the future politics in matter of competition will adjust more to the economic reality.
As #this is probably my last speech in front of the European Parliament gathered in session *plenaria, wanted to give thanks to #all persons with the that have worked during the 15 years that have formed part of the European Parliament and, in particular, to the fine citizens of the *Greater *Manchester Central, to the that have had the honour to represent from 1984 in the frame of the system of *circunscripciones individual.
The Commission shares likewise the importance that speaker and Defender of Village attribute to the strengthening of confidence of citizens in the #european Institutions, in particular *cuando citizens report situations that do not consider satisfied to the #european disposals.
*Cuando directs claim to the European Parliament, citizen no only reports *algo that to trial constitutes a bad application of the community legislation, but that to time expresses confidence in Parliament and the Institutions expecting that #this repair injustice.
Regarding the first sentence of the text, taking into account diversity of the subjects to argue in the field of «Customs 2000», the Commission prefers to leave to States members the possibility to take part with more of representative, so as to can debate specific arguments.
treats of a complex question, especially *cuando treats of the question of rates for road use, but deputies do not have to forget that States members possess already plans to fix price to utilisation of roads and that countries expect *introducirlos.
Step now to our second argue. Also refuse the concept of the Commission because it advocates consciously a preparation and an application in three stages, which comes to say that distortions of competition among transport moods and companies of the different States members keep in foot.
NATO #can not be at the same time leading in conflict and, according to diary *Le *Monde , speaker of the *UCK, that *le provides information on the #serbian positions that they have to be destroyed; #can not be a new police strength international that fulfils with a duty of interference and at the same time a humanitarian organism...
And is *irrisorio that the resolution proposal ask (in section 3) the application of the decisions of Nations Joined or that applaud (section 4) the «initiative» of the General Secretary of the UN, Mr. *Annan, without mentioning, although it was in two words, content!
In this frame, results particularly *chocante that, by reason, do not apply tolls in the metropolitan zones, in the that live persons with greater incomes and #where #would suit *desincentivar the utilisation of private vehicles, and keep in zones more disadvantaged in the that, by not having popular demonstrations neither electoral costs, increase #all the years.
From a point of formal sight, #this is a correct attitude. After all, the Commission had not presented officially new proposals or proposals modified from rejection of the proposal of the Commission by the European Parliament.
Wanted to also congratulate to the speaker, Mrs. *Thors, by report and *congratularme that the Commission of Juridical Subjects have integrated practically #all our proposals, the proposals of the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary, in report.
To the *respecto, the speaker suggests to examine the favourable looks to the institution of a *Ombudsman , or Defender, of the European Union for the financial services; *yo #would propose to go even more far and examine more amply claim measures that they have at present users of financial services in #all the Union.
rhythm of changes in the markets and in the financial intermediations has put of self-evident the possible limits of a sectorial approach and this phenomenon increases with the process of integration financial global.
Want to underline that, among things, in the text asks to the Commission that elaborate a #european rule, for the time being, lamentably non-existent, that guarantee elevated standard of security in road tunnels and rail, and to the Council that adopt without more delay directive proposal on controls of the commercial vehicles.
The Commission has promoted a wide legislation relative to norms for vehicles, of the that also form splits minimum norms on the *inflamabilidad of engine vehicles, like part of his legislative program for homologation EU of engine vehicles.
Take really a call to the European Commission so that *presione to Indonesian to end to achieve that it improve the situation, and *presionamos especially to the European Commission so that it also concern by that the elections develop well and by that, in these elections, concede rights to the minoritary groups of the smallest islands.
Gentleman President, the previous orators already have taken upsetting in the intolerable attitude of the Government of *Birmania, that denied to concede entrance visa to Dr. #Michael *Aris just before demise. Also have referred painstakingly to support that receives this frightful diet by part of Chinese.
Gentleman President, there #be not difference of opinion among the Commission and this House on the continuous and grave rapes of human rights occurred in *Birmania. The next 26 April will appear this country again in the agenda of the Council of General Subjects.
On the other hand, to the speaker no *le #can deny merit of having insisted in that measures proposed #can not give place to a *encarecimiento of transport. Adds that in case that the result was sure enough an increase of *losimpuestos, it #would be necessary to diminish in place charge for users of transport.
*Nosotros that we are managers of education and that, like politicians, #would have to be the most faithful interpreters of the needs of citizens, have the obligation to report the origins of violence and define fight methods more effective.
(OF ) Gentleman President, *me direct to *ustedes from my special situation, as I am the only deputy of this Assembly that came to the world before the *I World-wide War, that besides was chosen for Parliament *cuando already had surpassed amply retirement age and that afterwards has enjoyed of 20 years of life and parliamentary work.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the oral question (*B4-0155\/99) of Gentlemen *Colino *Salamanca and *Garot, in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on supply in vegetal proteins and the situation in industry of starch.
In this sense, the European Commission has elaborated proposals of action extremely positive that pretend to boost the sustainable urban development in the European Union. Like this, foresee fiscal incentives for house restoration and obviously contemplate special conditions for zones *extremamente sensitive, as it is the case of #Venecia.
Is the *noveno report of this term of office but no *le go to bore with #all statistics; it regrettable is that it is not a very pleasant question really and here no treats of legislation or the promotion of the #european integration, but of a subject of parliamentary immunity.
Gentleman President, the problem that *nos takes to see the suspension of immunities that today we treat is not neither more neither less that part of a general problem. This general problem is that this Assembly do not explains still with an only statute for deputies.
Another problem that arose was the that in moment probably no had neither a majority in the Assembly to concede the approval of the management neither an absolute majority for *denegarla, by it that Parliament was prisoner among these two requirements of different majorities of Regulation.
Obviously, the pact for stability was celebrated by *nosotros, but no *nos satisfies to #all *nosotros with stability politics that *estrangula the public budgets and that *les deprives of space political of manoeuvre and also of the need to create conditions mark in education, in investigation and in the professional training.
will Finish with the subject of the set up of the *GOPE saying that the Commission expects *encarecidamente that, to the contrary of it that occurred the past year, States members #can, along this *primer year of the euro, put of agreement on a content *prescriptivo precise, operative and no *edulcorado of the great orientations of the economic politics, especially regarding the recommendations by countries and to employment politics.
Maybe the fundamental characteristic went deficiencies of management structure, that remains very clear in paragraph 19 of the document attach, in the that it says: «deficiencies in management structure *propiciaron operative distortions in the application of politics». #Who knows?
Second, as it already has said Mr. *Elles, gives an indication to the new Parliament -#if well never have to pretend reign after dying and, of course, no a speaker that goes to abandon Parliament- on the type of questions that #can use to judge to the new Commission during appearances.
Gentleman President, wanted colleagues, with the examination of the report of colleague *Brinkhorst on postponement of the approval of the management for the exercise of 1997, our intention is not *hurgar in the grave wounds that have devastated to the Commission these last years *forzándola to resign.
Fear that interpretation in contrary sense had a *tufillo of electoral campaign in place of the exercise of the pure reason, because it that have said has been very simple: while it exist the prohibition, #can not have risk for health, because meat with hormones is not allowed in the European Union.
#This allows to States members orient experiments to those sectors of the #can expect the maximum benefit, #if experiment is wider, more data go to have with hindsight and greater goes to be the possibility to get to some definite measures very founded that they conduct to the creation of more stable employment and *eso was precisely of it that treated.
The recent experiences indicate that, in any case, #would suit to examine the possibility of the individual cessation, already was by initiative of President of the Commission, of Parliament or of the Council, with the participation in each case of the organs.
Although there #be not doubt that Parliament will confirm tomorrow his safe -nomination that by #one *holgada majority-, in September will have to face up to a much more difficult proof in front of Parliament in big part renewed and in front of the *cual, will have to present to School in plenary, #as well as action program that no *le will engage only to *usted, to personal title, but that will engage *colegialmente to the new Commission in group.
#If it do not wants to trip in the successive obstacles that will have to *sortear, will have to have very present that legitimacy, like President of the Commission, is a legitimacy delegated, that will be exerted under the permanent political control of the Council and of the European Parliament, that, political and directly, are managers in front of the #european population.
This coincidence, that was not foreseen in the normal calendar, gives to this debate and to the back vote character *algo dramatic, because, in mood, is the political will of the *primer European Parliament that it was able of *presionar to the salient Commission until point of *obligarla to resign.
Have to remember that, #if we have to give hope to the *Tercer World, with regard to the *cual now have a big responsibility -#can not forget, in effect, that *Europa is the greater economic structure of the world, repeat, the greater economic structure of the world- then is undoubted that also have to guarantee a world-wide economic order.
The opening of trade has allowed, in the last years, some spaces of growth to #some countries that were totally excluded of the world-wide game and has brought achieve -understand it and has gone back to remember in interventions- *gravísimas consequences for #some #european sectors and #some #european countries.
In consequence, have to ask the *imputación of *Milosevic; an enormous pressure on Mrs. *Harbour so that it explain finally how wants to take in the next hours; the informative bombardment and the integration of country that, gentleman *Fischer, are from takes more of twenty years, #if we think that in 1981 Frame *Pannella asked in Parliament the incorporation of the that then was *Yugoslavia in the #european Community.
*Yo also pray to the Commission and to the Council that take note that in quality of members of parliament #can take *algo more that celebrate these debates, that no always result too much interesting neither stimulating, and that the Council and the Commission have to include more closely to members of parliament in the formulation, but also in the execution of politics.
Given the calendar of Parliament, the Council considers that said query is not possible #if it wants to adopt the common strategy in the June Summit, time that the definite project of the document will not be available until 17 May.
*Yo wanted to highlight in particular my opposition to efforts of the speaker so that it postpone the adoption of the relative common strategy to relations with *Rusia, that is of the maximum importance in these moments, since said strategy *rebasa with grow the frame of the bilateral relations with country.
#If we do not take advantage of now the opportunity to solve an illegal situation that is in conflict with article 6 of the Treaty and, among things, delete discrimination by reasons of nationality that have kept from takes years, no longer will go back to present occasion; now #can take it in justice and in *concertación with the Council.
#Can be that reason exhibition technical-juridical have been fine, but have the impression of that #some of adherents hide an unseen motivation and that it that really do not want to is that it touch to #some of privileges. Because they serve of a series of arguments very odd.
About buildings wanted to leave also *algo clear -#this goes directed to *usted, lady Speaker, and to the Presidency: Have declared disposal to assume finally the promotions *ad *personam , that presented in amendment delivered to Mrs. *Müller, under condition that the Presidency fulfil it agreed and make finance of buildings in term of 10 years.
take It essentially because we accept that Internet is form surprisingly *excitante to make new transactions -expand trade, industry and employment in breast of the Community- but never to coast of the individual consumers in any Been member of the Union and, in measure of it possible, *protegiéndolos no only inside borders of the Union, but also out of #this.
So that directive proposal on measures that have to adopt against of the pertinent pollution of the engines allocated to *propulsar tractors follows orientations of the directive of 1997 on the pertinent broadcasts of the engines installed in the mobile machines no of road.
The balance among the #european institutions, in effect, has changed to be the that the Treaties of *Maastricht and *Amsterdam pretended: is to say, have got to a Commission #whose nomination and political action do not base already only in confidence of the Council but of decisive mood in confidence of Parliament.
And the that we have reached condition of mature Parliament and adult is very important for democracy, because democracy do not works only with fine intentions or with personal contributions, as #all know, but with institutions that go further of human beings, that take that work of deputies that do not go to go back have continuity in deputies.
Of course, is a bit difficult that the Council congratulate to President of Parliament, as #if praises are too much intense interprets as #if it had taken *algo badly. Thus, want to say that *usted is speaker of the Council, an uncomfortable speaker, conciliatory but *inflexible *cuando treats of defence of the rights of Parliament.
In Colony will treat the following questions: first, the European Pact by Employment; *segunda, the calendar for the institutional reform in *ciernes; third, the European Letter of Fundamental Rights; *cuarta, the common strategy for *Rusia and *quinta, development of the European Politics of Security and of Defence.
Is clear that the collective defence in *Europa goes to follow being task of NATO, but the European Union has to develop the capacity also for an own military management of crisis *cuando from the perspective of the Union or of the *UEO exist need to act and *cuando the North American do not want to or #can not take part.
Ask, to the equal that in the text of the month of November of 1997, #this is, in the resolution *Méndez Of *Vigo and *Tsatsos, a document of the Commission that #can constitute the base of #one *concertación *interinstitucional in the that are involved the representatives of the civil society, the national parliaments and the regions.
And *yo believe that, #if the Commission is in line, #if the European Parliament is in line, #if the national Parliaments have been involved, the legitimacy that will have this document will be enormous, and any Presidency in exercise and the Governments will be able to accept reflection document.
Consider that it is on of the table the need of an effective coordination of the economic politics and of a pact for employment, it that demands the political will to use for end the possibilities created by the euro.
The speeches pronounced in Parliament have outlined little by little the outlines of thought on *Europa with looks positive, in particular the wish to guarantee autonomy of the Commission and carry out a deep reform of his administrative uses.
Of course, is also a big hit in the balance of our political group, as the amendment of the Group of the Greens has been the only that has obtained an absolute majority and that has taken that the Commission and also the Council move.
In the last years have assisted to successive positions of the World-wide Organisation of Trade in subjects relative to the trade of agricultural and alimentary sakes and to the odd coincidence of these positions with the interests and pressures of States Joined of *América.
The case of banana reveals that the interest of the signatures multinationals explains one thousand times more that development of villages, and the market wins hand to the necessary solidarities that it is necessary to develop in breast of a political community.
Sure enough, regarding the relative conflict to banana, in name of liberalism and of globalisation of exchanges, States members of the European Union lose capacity to operate a specific and privileged politics with #some countries in roads of development with the *cuales kept historical exchanges.
Precisely in the case of the social Bottom, that produces with grow some great services to *Europa, already was in politics on handicapped persons, in the preventive politics of labour market or in helps to women, things have been very questioned until the last moment.
Want to express my congratulations especially to the speakers, Mrs. *McCarthy, Mr. *Hatzidakis, Mr. *Collins, Mr. #Walter, Mr. Baron *Crespo and Mr. *Arias *Cañete, also in quality of president of the Commission of Regional Politics.
Apart from the useful increase of bottoms, the new financial regulation supposes an important advance for being a suitable instrument to provide finance on a long-term basis for projects on a long-term basis, because it includes programming *plurianual, it that means that promoters of projects will be able to schedule with security without precedents on finance that #can expect with charge to the budget for networks *transeuropeas.
Like this has to be, #if we want the maintenance of the social model European -of the that #can *enorgullecernos-, but with the idea that it has to be a realistic model, in the that the improvement of work conditions was a reflection of the improvement of productivity conditions.
are in cooperation with the pertinent international organisations and regional initiatives and, especially, with States of the region, with the goal to make a Conference on the stability pact for the *Sureste of *Europa to level of high civil servants that will be summoned by the Presidency of the European Union in *Bonn the 27-5-1999.
The position of the Commission of Agriculture neither has supposed advance in this sense and go back to have to regret the statement of *inadmisibilidad of amendment of my Group in relation to the subject of modulations of helps.
Believe that it has been #one of the greater hits of Parliament, but no it is necessary to forget thus that, in it that to the regulation of application refers -and #this is the *segunda splits of the Report *Arias-, still have to ensure continuity of actions; continuity without the *cual, in my opinion, the structural politics *pesquera loses big part of his sense.
Go to take use of power, gentleman President, and wanted to warn to the Council that are decided to take it to guarantee, in the first place, the opening and transparency -and here *me *congratulo by efforts that has made to this *respecto work group of the Council- and, second, to guarantee that it exists #one *ecuanimidad among Parliament and the Council.
In fact, consider that the common position of the Council represents a step advance to reach a better protection of health and security of workers exposed to the risks of explosive atmospheres, that cause fatal accidents day.
This agreement, that includes the commercial goals of the interim agreement, incorporates a social philosophy, #one *panoplia of possibilities for cooperation in questions #such as the professional training, the regional development or support to the cultural diversity.
And finally, gentleman President, by #all reasons, wanted to say that my Group is adherent that the European Parliament approve this *dictamen satisfied, and with decision and with hardness with the that *nosotros condemn in day rapes of the human rights that had produced in this country, with firmness, repeat, ask that in this moment support this *dictamen satisfied.
In the previous stage to the decision of the Council #can check how part of personnel of the Secretariat of the Council *opuso *frontalmente to absorption of employees of *Schengen *arguyendo that had not happened by selection procedure usual.
Formally, do not needs to consult to Parliament, but politically is not correct, since integration of *Schengen in the Treaty, the election of the juridical base, determines how will develop the future *acquis and, therefore, #which will be paper of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice.
do not forget, without embargo, that by #a lot of that the *SIS have incorporated to the *tercer *pilar in virtue of the mechanism contemplated in the Protocol of *Schengen, the supervisory instance that watched by the correct application of the Agreement of *Schengen will continue exerting work and will guarantee that Information System of *Schengen respect the protection of the personal data.
In the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens go to miss his open attitude, his constructive and independent character, even #if *nosotras two have had discrepancies regarding my use of tongue maternal, English.
Gentleman President, is luck that *le have precisely to *usted in this moment of President of Plenary of Parliament because #this is #one of the last reports, #if no the last, of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and *usted has been during years member very effective of this commission.
Appreciate to the Commission the have fulfilled commitment to elaborate in mandate the Green Book and the White Book of trade, reaching that for the first time the Institutions tackled the sector of trade in #all looks.
attitude -#if it allows that this law approve by simple majority- will suppose that, in the future, Friday in the morning of day *nublado, with a majority of 48 votes against 47, Parliament, by chance, will be able to abolish and destroy no only the financial perspectives, but the group of cooperation building *interinstitucional built during the twenty last months.
But, instead, believe that this amendment is not admissible: #can not approve, by means of amendment, after having argued a report that carries a different title, the text of an agreement, that, on the other hand, modifies noticeably varied parts of the report, although it treat -in addition to reason exhibition- of #some sections.
The that today *nos have abstained in the vote of the report of Mrs. #Miranda of *Lage relative to the decision of the Council by the that establishes association agreement economic and of coordination and political collaboration among the European Community and States members on the one hand and States Joined Mexicans by the #another obeys to varied reasons.
#If in the next General Assembly of Nations Joined took really this decision of a moratorium, believe that we will have directed a positive message to #all the countries of the world and will have posed a problem also in countries that refuse to confront with decision this subject.
The *quinto look perhaps was the most positive of #all the process. Takes days president of the Constitutional Court has declared that #many of the legal disposals of *Turquía have to be modified because they attack against the human rights, because they attack against the rights of the democratic States.
has chosen a new President in *Djibuti. Is a good moment to remember that it has to put end to the rapes of human rights, to deal *humillante of the political prisoners, to right fault of prisoners, to the fact that *les enclose in prisons without *otorgarles cares.
Is with this wish, gentleman President, that *me allow to express, through person, my gratitude to the Table by the work developed in these five years, #as well as to the colleagues, especially the that take part in the meetings on the human rights and urgency problems, by work made up to now and by #everything it that have learnt of *ellos.
Gentleman President, do not know how is it that it #would be necessary to take from sight point of the procedure, but *le ask, to *usted that it is an understood in #the same, that devise *algún mood that we #can take into account this event and show that sure enough we are to the so much of the real process in place of *aferrarnos to some dogmatic postures that do not contribute at all new and do not contribute in at all to resolve this tragedy.
The Commission has engaged to continue with the initiative *SLIM\/*INTRASTAT and actions *EDICOM in favour of companies, of compliance with the position of the Council on information needs in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union.
On this question said, and then was to Commissioner *Cristoffersen: #this #can not follow like this, since there are systems different of failure in the European Union; already is hour that we #can create a #european anonymous society, no only to regulate jointly his creation but also dissolution.
*B4-0338\/99 of deputies *Ferrer, *Peijs and *Chanterie in name of the Group of the Popular Party European on massive imports to low price in the textile market European, and-*B4-0339\/99 of deputy *Moniz in name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists on massive imports to low price in the textile market European.
Think, in concrete, in the instruments of commercial defence that it has the European Union to delete obstacles to trade of the community products and also in measures of *salvaguardia foreseen in the agreements of the Round *Uruguay that, maybe, the Commission #would have to adopt.
On the other hand, in the resolution on the communication of the relative Commission to the textile sector and of preparation, and in action plan that afterwards elaborated the Commission, figure already a series of proposals in this direction.
A massive import in unsuitable conditions from diverse zones, among #others Asian, that of a clearer way *nos concerns (and celebrate the special comment of Mrs. *Gradin), #can give to fret with the possibilities of industry that -insist- has taken a big effort of adaptation.
#This considered that the reductions of social charges #can *falsear competition among #european producers. Declared illegal the textile plan French, asked to companies repayments impossible to satisfy and paralysed enlargement to other sectors of device allocated to save employments.
will Conclude mentioning worry originated, in this sense, by the first statements of Mr. *Prodi, that translate a very ideological conception of the notion of competition, since *él assimilates any regulatory action or *correctiva that carry out State to distortion of competition.
Gentleman President, *usted knows that I #be to be present in the sessions of Fridays, but seldom ask the word because almost always are with haste, have to take planes, etc. Today, *excepcionalmente, being the last day of the present term of office and taking into account it early of hour, *yo, in name of the Socialist Group, want *expresarle my recognition by work like president of session.
Gentleman President, for the first time after ten years go to vote to choose to President, or to Speaker, of the European Parliament, without that it mediate #any of these previous agreements among the Groups *democratacristiano and socialist, that symbolised, in my opinion, condominium species that blocked the democratic debate.
In breast of the Liberal Group have decided to support candidature no to form a political coalition, but like political expression with regard to the partial period of constitutive sessions, because from time to time they require political balances among the great political Groups Europeans.
With the decision of relative Colony to the celebration of a new Conference *Intergubernamental on the institutional subjects have opened, besides, the door to surpass very prompt the second big internal obstacle for enlargement.
#news that *Belgrado had accepted peace conditions got during Colony Summit of June month; and the resignation of the Commission after ten weeks of Presidency neither has facilitated at all things.
Although Group hailed explicitly the decision of Colony Summit to strengthen in the future the fundamental rights of citizens and citizens and proposes *apoyarla of active way, also criticise with firmness the Pact in favour of employment.
In war of *Kosovo have seen how much weigh has to launch *Europa in cymbal of scales also under the perspective of the possibilities of political configuration that exist, of the possibilities that exist so that it #can practise an external politics and of preventive peace, so that it #can promote a solution to conflict *cuando #this sharpens.
is not soap pomp but that it is at last a concrete approach to get further of some guidelines by employment to coordination of the economic politics of the European Union, to organise a greater growth.
Without embargo, *me seems totally unsuitable not seeing the devastations that has produced war, besides that in the *Balcanes, in the international legislation, in the international laws crushed, in the UN discredited and in the significant reduction of autonomy of *Europa with regard to the Atlantic Alliance and States Joined of *América.
Taking into account that a #roman donkey follow being it out of the #italian capital, as on the other hand it shows it the emblem of the list that, for the elections to Parliament, carries name, by coherence #can not *otorgarle my confidence for the Presidency of the Commission.
*Eso showed perfectly, from the principle, independence will and will to take that the Commission was without place to doubts, independent of the countries, independent of the national mentalities and also of the #ours political options here, in Parliament, as it establishes the Treaty.
The range of resources to use in the external relations has to be consolidated with the end of *hacerlas more efficient, it is necessary to improve capacity to warn the crisis and it is necessary to increase availability to react after the crisis.
commitment of *Europa #can not understand directed only to reconciliation of parts involved in conflict, but that will measure by the global capacity that will know to show to hour to conciliate the Stability Pact, reconstruction and unemployment always more increasing.
And here have to be conscious of the fact that #if development has to be harmonic, have to take upsetting in the word «justice», have to promote the #european judicial network, have to be able to give effectiveness to sentences, take that sentences are executive, so much the penal like the no penal, and have to facilitate the direct relation among judges.
development of the Union to a centralist federal model like the American it is necessary to avert it, and it is necessary to pursue a more decentralised Union #whose paramount principle *acerque more to the model of #swiss confederation.
*Nos seems an extraordinary fault of sensitivity in this concrete moment, in the current climate, having an interim Commission, that somebody #can in this situation simply say two days later that it wants to go to work for a private company that it is #one of the main operators in the field of telecommunications of the that is responsible.
Although it treats of observation that do not has at all that see with the debate in course, take advantage of occasion to say that *me surprised very negatively the fact that usually, *cuando took part in the conciliation Committees, Commissioners were present and were mainstays less #one: gentleman Commissioner *Bangemann, in spite of complaints, did not take part never and sent to civil servants.
With this end, the competent services of the Commission have gathered regularly with the third states and have taken advantage of the session *plenaria of the *OMC\/*SPS of days 7 and 8 July to inform on state of the question and of the legal performances undertaken.
treats of it following: *dígale to Parliament how many veterinary and inspectors need, concern that the procedures to occupy the squares are faster and that the assignment of places inside the Commission was more dynamic, and then will be able to put in practice a better system of internal control in the Commission and also under control.
Go to go back to open negotiations with the *OMC and, to the equal that Parliament in group, expect of *ustedes, the Commission, that finally have norms of health, environmental norms and social norms that avenge to limit, frame theory, that day to day takes more dangerous, of a free market #whose gain is the engine number #one.
Practically has not taken out education, from the point of institutional sight, of crisis so important that the past month of March translated by the collective resignation of the Commission, because of an irresponsible management.
Was an open popular party and friendly, that gave a big image of sport, an image of diversity of squads and of nations, an image of fraternity existent in breast of our continent.
In this moment see that there are deputies in the Hemicycle that carry banners supporting a cause concerning the *cual the big majority, included *yo same, shares feeling favourable, but #can *usted *indicarnos #any norm, #any rule or contribute #any guideline to this Assembly concerning demonstrations of form that are not interventions that make according to the Regulation of Parliament?
This Commission, the salient Commission, has celebrated it that probably went his last meeting the past Wednesday and, therefore, has not had occasion, in the brief lapse of time passed from delivery of the document, to analyse in depth content and take definite positions on #the same.
On the background of #all considerations and the statements of today of the political leaders in this Assembly, guarantee by part of the Commission designated that the report goes to be treated like a fundamental ingredient of the reform proposals of the Commission.
Believe that #this is precisely the decisive point: have to learn to practise a successful management in the #european plane and #this only will reach -it is necessary to say it with clarity to the Commission- #if we get here to common solutions among Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
say It because on 15 September - Wednesday of this week, *cuando go to occur things - is the date limit that it has given the Commission of Poured Radioactive of the Convention of *Ottawa to the #british Government to contribute proposals about how #can proceed better to reduce the poured of radioactive substances in the half marine.
The *segunda #inspired -observation, clear is by anxiety and by my big pity after the earthquakes of *Atenas- is that our environmental legislation, that will have to review and apply, did not includes still, or did not includes sufficiently, #if they want to, disposals referred to the uses of earth, to the half urban, to aggressions to the environment in the urban space.
President designated of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, has left perfectly clear that proposes to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work in narrow collaboration in the application of program of global work in the Union during the next five years.
impulse has given it gentleman *Prodi, that has appointed an expert committee to produce a *preinforme in name of the Commission *cuando Colony Council had refused explicitly this idea of the committee of wise persons.
In effect, in spite of the recommendations of the *primer inform of the committee of independent experts confirmed by the second inform that it finishes to publish , has not set up initiative to modify methods and operation moods of the Commission.
And #this because, further of the political balances in the distinct Institutions, will have anyway paper of the Council like representative of the Governments and paper of the Commission and of the European Parliament, some Institutions with community and federal vocation and in what #such, engines of integration.
In front of the Council that expresses the will of the national Governments and in front of Parliament that is the expression of villages, is necessary a strong Commission, responsible, call to propose apt initiatives to guarantee the aspirations of the #european citizens.
Gentleman President designated, along intervention, *usted has insisted in a subject that *nos interests to a large extent, is to say, the need to undertake a fight by the #european identity, a fight without the *cual #can not reach the ambitious goals that #all villages of *Europa, Parliament and #all the Institutions want to reach.
Expect that it impose like priority transparency in the operation of the European Commission, and that the main goals that pose are protection politics of citizens, of employment, of cultural progress, #as well as of solidarity bear with villages that suffer by the fault of democracy and by poverty.
Gentleman President designated of the Commission, #if today we had to choose among his *opositores and reasons that have exposed and *usted, *nos #would find in difficulties perhaps until point of having to *abstenernos or even vote to favour, by it poor and unlucky that *nos seem the arguments that *esgrimen in Plenary the last communist and allies of *Milosevic against NATO and States, the conservative British and other.
Insisting in the political repercussion that have had the results of the recent elections to the European Parliament in breast of the European Commission, until where have to get regarding restricting and impose to the national governments election of Commissioner?
#One third part of candidates no answered to the question of Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities relative to, integration of equality goals among men and women in the general politics (*gender *mainstreaming).
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Commission, do not go to repeat it that already have expressed my colleagues of the *PPE and, in quality of member of the #belgian delegation, do not go to introduce the #belgian inner politics in the debate.
Mr. *Prodi *nos has said that it wants to that the Commission was an authentic #european Government and Mr. *Poettering, president of the main political Group of Parliament, has talked, even, also of paper of Parliament in relation with the European Commission.
So that the fight against delinquency was effective, needs a narrower cooperation among States members, thing that translates in approach of legislations, in the improvement of the police collaboration and in coordination of investigation of offences.
The political challenge constituted by asylum and immigration requires a balance among the need of *salvaguardar asylum like individual right and to offer the owed protection to refugees, and the wish to offer resistance to the economic migration.
The extraordinary European Council of *Tampere has, beyond all doubt, a special importance, and *ello because it is called to configure political more complete for freedom, security and justice in the European Union. In the European Union under his current form.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, receive with satisfaction the celebration of a European Council devoted in part to the space of freedom, security and justice, that testifies consciousness taking by part of the #european institutions and States of the importance of the indispensable questions for the future of *Europa.
Observe with satisfaction that the Council and the Commission, with spirit *solidario, have adopted the necessary measures to guarantee to the #turkish authorities help of the European Union and to cooperate with *ellas to end to relieve sufferings of village.
Is by it that our Commission of Constitutional Subjects asks that the European Parliament do not occupy a merely secondary place in a so important process, but that it #can collaborate in foot of equality with the Council, enjoying of initiative capacity and of decision.
#would owe also establish, as it foresees it the own Treaty of *Amsterdam, effort *equitativo among #all States members to confront the consequences that derive of the received of refugees, persons displaced or the strong migratory pressures that have nature exclusively economic, like the that have origin in the #mediterranean third countries or flank south of the Union.
Of course, lady Speaker of the Council, that the migratory politics is inseparable part of the external politics, but in occasions the external politics subjects to #others *designios, *designios that they #can finish going back against the humanitarian look related with asylum politics and with the migratory politics.
Although it have been engendered among the fifteen prime ministers, #this is now his own government, released of control of the countries members, *distanciado of the national parliaments, to years light of the constituents of on foot and of the fiscal taxpayers and without having been subjected still to control of the European Parliament.
In these historical moments in that Basques bet by the #european construction like democratic path of understanding, conciliation and peaceful coexistence with #all Spaniards, #as well as with #all the villages of *Europa, it that less need, it that more #can affect to peace that look for and long for is that it do not respect #ours residual fiscal sovereignty, our economic concert.
The maintenance of the criteria of *Maastricht and of the Stability Pact deprives of the lower credibility to the "European Pact for Employment", it that, together with the insistence in the *flexibilización of work relations, reveals clearly that it bets by #one *desreglamentación every time greater of the labour relations.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the capacity of Commissioners to answer to the enormous expectations that have aroused and to introduce a very different type of behaviour and of culture in the new Commission, *nos took to expect demonstration of a capacity to effect true reforms, transcendental and radical.
President *Prodi, wish luck and hit to Vice-president Palace, that will commission of relations with the European Parliament and of #whose qualities am more that convinced, #as well as to #all the active commissioners in work field -Mr. *Patten, Mr. *Verheugen and especially Gentlemen *Reding and *Vitorino, that have been #ours colleagues during years-.
assignment of bottoms supposed an important challenge for the credibility of the European Union, and the fact to have approved without modifications in Budget Commission is proof of this big responsibility to the that *me referred.
behaviour of the national authorities in these subjects has to adapt to the valid legislation of country under control of his political and juridical organs, and has to respect the international norms of protection of the human rights.
But is that, besides, believe that the Council has answered correctly and #would be well that the socialist deputy, that besides is spokesman of delegation, took the duties and studied a bit more how is *eso of the #european construction and did not leave in ridiculous to his parliamentary group with questions on questions that are not community competitions and that they have to solve in the national field.
But the necessary coordination #can not give place never to that any Been member of the European Union evade his own responsibility: neither State neither #any of the administrations that compose the territorial political-division, as it has occurred in reference case in my country.
States members, in measure of it possible and to instances of the country President of the Union, will continue work of *adecuación of the common positions with the Convention project and also will try to get to agreements in the questions that influence of important form in the interests of the Union.
In the Council of General Subjects of the past June took a decision, by the *cual the Commission will have to present during the month of September a proposal that ensure that politics of the Union in the sector *platanero fulfil norms of the *OMC.
As it will know the Assembly, the proposal of the Commission is relative fundamentally to the creation of an agency that commission to apply the programs of community reconstruction, initially in *Kosovo, but later, *cuando the circumstances allow it, also in other regions of the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia as Serbian and *Montenegro.
To take into account the evolution of the political situation in the region, article 6 of the Agreement establishes that, at the end of the year 2000, will be reexamined advances in matter of refugees and will evaluate likewise the eventual programs of the *OOPS relative to the incorporation of the #palestinian authorities to functions.
After it that have said before and also after it that has said Mr. Commissioner *Kinnock this morning in name of the Commission and of it that *nos informed yesterday the Presidency #finnish of the Council in the sense that by moment no exists any *margen of performance to attend amendments, pray to the colleagues that give his favourable vote.
Practically, in section of resolution, the European Parliament expands interpretation of the decision of Colony Council, to end of *ensoberbecerse, of *marginar to the national Parliaments and to prepare transformation of the future Letter in #european Constitution.
workers have #all the interest in resisting to projects that are, in putting to the discovered hypocrisy of the European Union and of States members and in changing, with fight, changes that put in danger his public freedoms.
But #all repeat it same: are discouraged by corruption; investment conditions are very *desfavorables, because no exists a viable fiscal system on a long-term basis, the laws change constantly, infrastructure is scarce and, it that it is worse, property rights, included the rights of intellectual property, are deficient and garbled.
Gentleman President, seems that *Encélado is very angered with #Grecia and *Turquía and that, as it is a perfect ignorant of dialogue and of relations, has given loose rein to rage of a catastrophic form, seeding death, anxiety, pain, despair and crying in the two countries.
Gentleman President, the fight by power in the Islamic Republic of will Go among adherents of conservatism and adherents of reformism continues without diminishing until today, with #all the consequences that #this comports for Right State, is to say, the no application of the general principles of Right State.
To the open the session, *usted has announced that they have approved #some initiatives and that have given concrete answers to the parliamentary press, but, repeat, believe that it is necessary to take more to convert in easier work of journalists, so as to take to know to #all the European Union the important work that makes Parliament.
Lady Speaker, *me cheer that Unit already have tackled the problem of the communication because apart from the failures - *yo #would say - human of building, that on the other hand is very prestigious *arquitectónicamente, but inside the *cual there #be really space #stray that #can not use, believe that there #be also transport problems.
The massive industrial pollution of foods by the use of additives, without respecting a reliable maximum limit, creates in consumer the impression justified that production of *forraje is terrain in front of utilisation of *piensos.
Wanted to say that the list of possible functions at all is exhaustive and, #if it existed the obligation to prepare an annual report and #if civil servants appeared periodically in front of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer of Parliament, #can guarantee also account surrender.
All *ello with the end to be able to warn always the problems, in place to run preys of panic *cuando the problems already have produced and have *quebrantado confidence of the #european citizens, in addition to cause grave damages to the public health.
Like this, the most affected states by illness #would have to enjoy of the right to the compulsory licences that *les allow to produce, to the lower cost, generic treatments *anti HIV effective to avert the apparition of opportunist illnesses that conduct inevitably to death.
This fact has a scope and a gravity without precedents by form in that illness affects very especially to a continent with the *cual the European Union keeps relations and some peculiar bonds that, to my understand, have *entibiado totally in these years and that have failed entirely goal.
Thus Budget Commission has proposed to Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy that demand a partial review of the financial perspectives and has achieved to include in this report a positive quotation on the subject.
*Yo appreciate a lot and *me *congratulo, lady Commissioner, that responsibility in this field so important *le correspond to *usted, as in quality of #ex-Minister of #spanish Agriculture *usted already knows well that, in the frame of the #european agricultural politics, surely results much more reasonable to reduce #obtaining of *excedentes that devote useful surfaces to the *aprovechamiento energetic of biomass.
Gentleman President, *acaso it that more cheers of this agreement is that with *él happen of rhetoric to the facts and the European Parliament, that has *propiciado and has followed of wall the negotiation process giving impulse and acting like spur, #would owe today affirm that it will put energy in follow-up of the application of the agreement and results.
In conclusion, #if well I receive with satisfaction that *Sudáfrica have reached a participation in important #european markets, expect that we also take advantage of educations that give off of this agreement and watch by that in the future rhythm, the *escalonamiento and the field of application of the agreements of free trade reflect more faithfully the different needs of the countries participants.
All it that the #european institutions offer to *Sudáfrica in matter of cooperation is a commercial agreement painstakingly negotiated so that the interests of trade and of the #european industry are advantageous, an agreement that will not benefit to *Sudáfrica, only to this *ínfima minority of exporters of lovely stones and of agricultural products that have been the main *beneficiarios of apartheid.
On the other hand, do not imagine, gentleman Commissioner, that consider the possibility to increase the current level of imports of the European Union in wines #south african -*les remember that they are 320.000 *hectolitros- without preserving a minimum of rights *arancelarios, save to risk to disturb gravely #all the #european sector.

Confirm to the European Parliament that, in the frame of regulation of the Structural Bottoms, with credits at present available #can contribute a substantial help to the #greek population that has seen affected, is to say, wall of 20.000 homes, without talking of varied *cientos of victims.

*Turquía has to work still a lot and is necessary that advance still of considerable mood so much in the political field as in the economic, but in front of the enormous strategic importance of *Turquía for the future of *Europa, for security, stability and peace in *Europa, #would be a grave error *negarle the inclusion with rights in the enlargement process.
Nevertheless, to speed up this process believe that it is necessary *sopesar seriously the proposal of president Mr. *Pöttering to fix a diary of regular meetings among *Turquía and the European Union, so as to debate of democracy and human rights, of minorities, of economic and social development, of security and external politics.
The process is a complex process - has remembered it gentleman Commissioner *Patten - and, without embargo, today have even terms and steps in the *cuales will take place some facts that allow to discern the final solution, is to say, recognition of two States sovereign and independent that #can coexist on the base of a reciprocal security.
And *ello in spite of it stipulated in article *K.6 of the Treaty of *Maastricht, in the sense that ministers of the EU will consult regularly to Parliament on the main looks of activity in the fields of justice and of interior subjects and will watch by that his opinions "take properly in account" .
Without embargo, contradiction among the #european decision to raise the embargo and the #french refusal to take it creates an unsustainable situation, that shows, *cuando still have not fulfilled six months from ratification of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the *inconsecuencia of #the same that the have supported.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen Deputies, this debate that have wished to celebrate on the new cycle, poses, in my opinion, an important question: The Union contributes, by his own action, to the governments and to the #european citizens supplementary means to adapt with hit and to dominate globalisation?
*Finlandia has proposed that the Council declare intention to continue in the future Presidencies developing indicators and *benchmarking for other critical fields determined in the action plan of the Conference of *Pekín and to engage to study periodically advances in the matters that argue.

Gentleman President, lady Speaker of the Council, lady Commissioner *Schreyer, *Señorías, women are half of the sky, as it already said an ancient #chinese proverb, and is very logical that women of the European Union take part also in proportion in the budget of the Union.
It true is that the Council in fact has declared in this context: want to fund an important task for the future and also in actuality, that surely will prolong varied years, specifically, help for the population of *Kosovo, and for *financiarla go to apply cut of the 10 % in #all the budgetary lines.
Like effect, the initiatives of the #european citizens precisely see braked, and therefore reform of the Commission will have to contribute to an improvement of service by means of a more effective cost, transparent and in accordance with the political elections of the budgetary authorities.
Have treated to answer to norm no written of averting an excessive number of games and notes in the budget.
This amendment foresees the *consignación of credit of 50 millions of euros in the financial reservation for finance of actions of producers or States members that establish quality control integral in the whole of chain alimentary.
Likewise, the European Parliament has invited to members of the Executive Committee of #ECB and of personnel to take part in audiences on varied specific subjects, among *ellos the external representation of the *SEBC, the preparation of euro notes and questions of statistics.
#ECB will act like catalyst of change and, together with the national central banks of the *SEBC, will treat these subjects with the banking sector of the zone of the euro to end to exert support paper and coordination in this sense.
#This is the first occasion in the that the European Parliament has given sight point about advances of the Central Bank European and, in this context, is my *grato owe the congratulate to #ECB and to Mr. *Duisenberg, like president, by hit until moment.
Thus, gentleman President of the Central Bank, believe that the meeting of day, and mainly the *contrapoder ridiculous that tries to exert Parliament in regard to the considerable can that *le has entrusted to *usted, #can not more that concern to #all the that believe in the national sovereignty, that for villages only is form to control destination.
Also believe that the financial markets and citizens of *Europa will not expect less of this new Central Bank, and that Parliament will have to be relentless when pursuing the goal of a Central Bank open and democratic European for the near future.
But in the Treaty of *Maastricht did not take out the institutional consequences that *dereivaban of this decision, and therefore we are today of the independence of the Central Bank, of lace of the Central Bank with other institutions and of the pending problems.
In any case, have got to the majority position of my Group, basing this decision in the fact that sight point mentioned #can diminish, instead of increasing, confidence of the market in activity of the Bank.
For example, exists our document that publishes immediately after the meetings of Government Council that contains considerations that have been important in the definite decision of Government Council in the case that they have changed or no interest types.
By the contrary the editorial "without damage" clears, and #that is intention, that the system of the euro did not has obligation to act of this mechanical form #if it estimates that take it like this #would engage price stability in the future.
And third question: #can deduce of it that today have argued that THROW will keep his full identity to pipe the humanitarian help of the European Union in situations of crisis, or, rather, that performance of THROW and the own humanitarian help will dilute progressively inside the general politics of cooperation for development of the Union?
Are too much numerous politicians and politics, journalists, defenders of the human rights and citizens that have paid with life fight by a juster society and more human.
No treats to create a new instance of review of the catalogues of rights fundamental national, but yes a juridical right that affect to performance of the #european institutions and to legislation that takes for citizens.
#If we consider it in whole, the report of Mr. *Dehaene pretends, on the one hand, the extension of the qualified majority and, to time, the *constitucionalización of the Treaties and division in two parts, a subjected to a very strict procedure, that requires unanimity for reform, and #another by majority.
This last initiative of the EU, that comes to complement #others to national level, will help to create the suitable regulatory frame that allow to the #european companies be to the avant-garde of the development of services commercial electronic.
Like this, when favouring the free circulation of capitals in the world-wide level, when pretending liberalise even more investments, the #european governments transform pension bottoms #anglo-saxon in authentic *regentes of the economic and financial markets.
Believe that, by the contrary, it is necessary to put in cloth of trial the social model European that is the social model of the *Europa of unemployment, of taxes, of the *Europa with union that has an enormous power that blocks the economic growth and forbids to millions of unemployed #italian, French and Germans, #as well as to millions of immigrants find work, to protect situations that, with frequency, are not more that situations of privilege.
*Eso wants to say that inside the Union it is necessary to get to a true coordination of the fiscal politics and to a formulation of norms social comparable for #all so that they do not go back to produce distortions of competition that still result very sensitive today.
*Cuando a simple operation of communication allows to the *cotización of company win the 12%, in spite of not having created value #any, have not produced neither sold tyre supplementary, taking believe that simply they #can appear spontaneously wealths by the simple mechanism of the financial markets, is a total contempt of the human work.
The European Union adopted in July of 1999 a common posture, #whose goal is to intensify cooperation in the frame of actions to scale international to achieve the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of total prohibition of nuclear proofs.
The Union supports works *preparativos of the commission commissioned to create the Organisation of the Treaty of total prohibition of proofs and to elaborate to time and with efficiency the system of *comprobación of the planned form in the treaty.
Is necessary to guarantee to the less talked tongues finance that deserve, of it contrary, excellent innovative projects - the theatre, translation of literature after the end of project *Ariane - and language education, among things, will suffer the consequences.
Wanted to say simply that the amendment 4 on the *comitología is accepted in principle by a simple reference in the text to management procedure established by disposal of the Council, of 28 June 1999, by the that fix modalities of the exercise of execution competitions conferred to the Commission.
The report of the Council of *Europa on Politics of coherent family and integrated says: "families have a paramount paper in socialisation, because they transmit values, norms, habits and the behaviour of the social group to the that belong children.
Gentleman President, want to say in the first place that, of compliance with article 157, by means of letter of 6 July 1999, the Council consulted to Parliament on decision proposal of the relative Council to the participation of the Community in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector.
Wanted to take upsetting in that activities of the Observatory and of *Eurostat do not coincide in terms of the period that covers, the geographic scope or the result, and #can be coordinated of an useful way to reach a clear vision of the complex reality of the audiovisual sector.
In this moment, terrorists have been detained, the hostages have been released, but had account of the gravity of it occurred, and #if His *Señorías agree, will express, in name of the European Parliament, solidarity and condolence to village *armenio, in a letter directed to President of the Republic of *Armenia.
Gentleman President, in name of the Socialist Group *me #would enjoy to say that we support the approval of the agreement *interinstitucional, a fundamental piece in the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union by form in the that tackles the problem of fraud and treats indictments of fraud
The coincidence of the announcements has put to the nude, of flagrant way, the scandalous and unfair look of the current economic logic and of this financial capitalism, that has finished for dominating *Europa and the world.
The present proposal pretends an extension of the transitory period previously mentioned until 1 July of the 2001, or even more, for the case of transport of squads to pressure, on the that no exist technical specifications detailed or sufficient quotations in the corresponding #european norms.
Am conscious, without embargo, of the need of *prorrogar the periods of the directive 96\/49, with the end that States members do not see in the need to modify his national legislations for a brief space of time, thing that #would involve additional costs for states and for industry.
Like this as, today is urgent to detain privatisations, increase personnel and occupy seriously of training, establish the necessary budgets allocated to the maintenance and to control of #the same, create committees of control professional\/users on traffic, impose a right of veto in front of transfers *cuando the risks are real.
These negotiations will take place in a concrete context, marked by two new elements; by part, the disappearance of Majesty *Hassán *II, the last giant of history of the century *XX and, on the other hand, the principle, accepted takes #some days, of adhesion candidature of *Turquía.
Without embargo, it is necessary to regret the *tardanza, that has created a social alarm and a state of nerves in the fleet that #can have averted, and speculations and pronouncements that #can take worse that well to negotiations that, by the importance of the agreement, #would have to develop in a discreet frame, calm and cordial.
Think it that think of fishing agreement, regarding the consequences for the local population or for fishing fleet #european, will have *poca persons that want to put to level the humanitarian disasters like the had in *Kosovo, *Timor Oriental and the earthquake of *Turquía with this agreement in matter of fishing.
The 30 November is next and seems that it goes to conclude a new agreement, therefore, with a scarce attention by part of the Commission to the economic level of the regions of the Goals 1 and 2 that, depending to a large extent of the exercise of fishing, warm up serious worries of face to the maintenance of employment in the sector.
In the summit of #Florencia, celebrated in January of 1996, Government Bosses agreed that the decision to raise the embargo to Realm Joined #would take "pure and exclusively on the base of the public health and of scientific criteria goals, in accordance with the existent procedures that satisfy to criteria" .
Want common sense and want to base our decisions in science because, in differences that produce in the future -and will produce #many about the *inocuidad of foods, because consumers are very concerned now by foods that buy-, scientists, objectivity and the independence of scientists is absolutely crucial.
*Yo #would not say it same of #all the sectors of our #european relations; neither #would say it of relations with the third countries, without embargo, in breast of the Union, exists beyond all doubt a common agricultural politics and responsibility of #all with regard to politics.
Although in the frame of the #european politics infringement of the Treaties was a fundamental criterion for #all *nosotros, like deputy of my electoral district #can not *mantenerme out of the political debate with this argument in the current circumstances.
Finishes to know that Agriculture Minister #british, that belongs to party, not even has established dialogue with his homologous French, *algo that results ridiculous, #if it considers form in that they are *caldeando spirits in the process of this commercial war.
The Commission has taken well in agreeing a protocol of only a year, so much more what that during the last years the #angolan authorities have been victims of intense abuses, especially by part of the #russian fleet. This situation has caused a spectacular fall of activities *pesqueras.
Although, sure enough, have to complete data or statistical on the that the Commission *nos has promised that goes to be strict, and having also in account the delicate situation in that it finds country -in state of war-, consider that the signature of this protocol of provisional application is very positive, #waiting for the renewal by a year or to that elaborate a new Agreement.
So that the euro receive weight that deserves, no longer only in the international economy, but also in the economic political-dialogue in the area of the Union, it is necessary to deepen in the common visions, especially, in matter of economic politics in the zone of the euro.
Our own investigations reveal that the economic development in the traditional sense is limited in zones by fault of the fault of drinkable water and because the European Union produces already more toxic waste that the that it #can tackle like by-product of the economic growth.
According to this institution, the own drivers, carriers that work out of the sector of transport, #such as concrete transport in the sector of wood and of the construction, belong to the category of mobile workers.
Employment Commission and Social Subjects of Parliament refuses this interpretation, in part, because workers remain, then, partially out of the field of application of the existent directive relative to ordination of work time.
time that the Council concedes to States members and, therefore, to himself\/hisself same to adopt the directive that modifies the current directive relative to ordination of work time, situates, according to the common position of the Council, in four years.
The effect of this amendment will be the to try limit to a year the period of available reference for the annual computation of the calculation of the labour day or, said of mood, watch by that it was possible said annual computation, but no more.
Gentleman President, in a free market with boundless competition, company that produce to a better price has the best opportunities of survival, also *cuando product only #can be cheap by the bad labour conditions, the low wages, the environmental pollution or cruelty with animals.
Also exists look of the agreement that is surrounded of secret. Take for granted that *cuando apply point 5 of the annex on intellectual property do not take of a literary way, but that more in concordance with the general rules of opening that fortunately govern in actuality in our Union.
In the first place, are agreements that approved quickly, by it that it wanted to appreciate to #all the speakers, #as well as to members of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence and of Budget Commission, that have examined the proposals in brief terms.
In Realm Joined there #be a particular interest in fuel saving by the excessive levels of taxes fixed by Government *laborista for fuels, that pose particular problems to residents in rural zones, like the #mine, in the that many times the public transport is non-existent.
*Yo believe that #this is in reality #one of the central points of the directive: sensitise to consumer on the problem so that it begin to concern a bit by the reduction of CO2 broadcasts *cuando treats of mate favourite, car, and include also look in considerations.
In the first place, from Parliament want to be intimately associated with #all and each #one of the steps of the cycle that poses in the inner market with the selection of the strategies, with the selection of second goals level and with the selection of the concrete goals.
And here *yo wanted to signal to Mr. *Lehne that, definitely, has not read the strategy of the Commission when saying that the social considerations were out of #this, because the strategic goal number 1 that has fixed the Commission is to improve quality of life of citizens.
To the directive on the electronic signature *le will follow surely, among #others, the directives on the electronic trade and author rights in society of information, and on the protection of consumers in sale to distance of financial products.
This sentence *nos carries to the question of the *conceptuación of defence of consumers like a requirement *inexcusable to prevent the free circulation of commodities, in the sense of the jurisprudence *Dassonville, *Cassis of *Dijon, etc. In definite, *nos conducts to the principle of the mutual recognition, that seems to be very wanted by Mr. *Bolkestein.
Is precise to conciliate reforms directed to the promotion of the dynamic competition and of flexibility with the requirement of the maintenance, and also of modernisation, of the system of social security. Like this understand the #european model.
Gentleman President, *yo also appreciate to the speaker his excellent work and have to put of relief that the irrefutable data that has seen to drop unemployment of the 10,1 to the 9,4 has to be valued positively, to the equal that politics carried out by the European Union in matter of employment with the four *pilares fundamental, to the *cuales *me allow to add, anyway, the linguistic training and the problem of immigration.
Has remained patent that from Colony advance processes, the processes of the autumn and of the spring, but, how doubt fits, am always #waiting for proposals and practical procedures of materialisation of this narrower collaboration, that, anyway, gives in a first stage in the corresponding commission, is to say, in Employment Commission and Social Subjects.
Only Parliament that treats of *desterrar the political statements and the political signatures to the basements, Parliament that, in fact, is governed by bureaucratic logics #can allow that discrimination situation of deputies no inscribed that have less right that the deputies, follow being #the same, from takes months.
Lady Speaker, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, although #all have supported the relative reports to the situation of employment, are of the opinion that unemployment tax in *Europa is dramatically high and that against #this *nos *nos occurs any effective recipe so much in the national states as in the #european plane.
The European Union and States national members in moment have to work in narrow relation with the #european industries of car and of oil to guarantee that, of time for ever, will disappear pollution in a near future.
program is important and answers to commitment that *nosotros have to reach a high level of protection to health in the European Union, as *nos follow tripping still with frequency with the effects of violence in the Community. the *cuales constitute a very grave threat for health.
Gentleman President, of course that I do not have at all against of the fact that part of the budget devote to the preventive measures against violence exerted on boys, teenagers and women, always that it apply to a financial help awarded to associations that occupy of these subjects.
The present proposal will guarantee minimum standards of information and query that it is necessary to apply in #all the territory of the Union harmonising these fundamental rights of workers - that already are presents in States members - and contributing to the strengthening of the #european social dimension that it is the goal that #all have.
In fact, attribute special importance to #the same and besides forms part of a wider matter that it has to see with the preparation and accompaniment with a view to changes in course in the labour market, so as to that #this do not produce negative results, especially in it that to security of workers and of work place refers.
Have proposed that *instituya a suspension of six months for restructuring plan, to allow an independent #sindical advice, and also have proposed that, #if company receives public helps but do not respects norms established, has to return the sums perceived.
Gentleman President, in speaker quality of the Agreement *interinstitucional of the *cual derives this decision, wanted to know the position of the Commission, because it has not pronounced to the *respecto, on the proposal that take to exclude of the guideline the planned costs for the future adhesion.
Independently of it that think on electricity source, no fits doubt that it supplies an important part of electricity in *Europa and takes it of mood that do not produces broadcasts of CO2 neither of gases that cause the effect of *invernadero and #that is reason -the only reason- by the that has mentioned in this report.
The sustainable development is not only a noble goal, is an obligation imposed by the Treaties, by it that it has to constitute the fundamental principle of any future politics energetic #european and to time it is necessary to reach a balance.
Support the initiatives in the #european level that contribute to measures adopted by States members to fulfil commitments with arrangement to the Protocol of *Kyoto on limitation of gas broadcasts that cause the effect of *invernadero by part of the energetic sector.
Is necessary to keep quota of atomic energy for the electrical production at least to the current level and perhaps have even that *aumentarla lightly to be able to get to the ambitious goal of reduction of dioxide broadcasts of carbon, to the that *Ustedes, estimated friends, lady *Plooij- go *Gorsel and lady *Ahern, #as well as #all the other in this Hall, have engaged.
In practice, a similar proposal #would translate in the arrest of development of the renewable energies in the 5% as in country there #be Inland revenue minister that want to fund the development of projects in countries.
Gentleman President, in the first place want to appreciate and congratulate to Mr. *Chichester by his positive and constructive report on the communication of the Commission to the Council and to Parliament with regard to the consolidation of the environmental integration of the community energetic politics.
Without place to doubts this regulation supposes a remarkable step forward, by it that *le give the thanks to Mrs. speaker, without embargo, will have to go back to tackle this subject regarding the nomadic boys, race boys #gipsy and, in consequence, to #all the internal problems of families, among the that they explain the related with mobility in *Europa.
Said installation is obsolete, according to the classification taken by the Executive in Diary 2000, in the *cual the nuclear head offices divide in three categories: the of #soviet or obsolete type that they have to dismantle for being dangerous; head offices that it is necessary to reform for *permitirles reach levels of acceptable security by part of the Union and the of western type, #whose number is lower, that #can follow working, with #such that security level follow being elevated on a long-term basis.
The abandonment of the use of the nuclear energy with civil ends do not appears in the agenda and is necessary to have present implications of character economic and social of the decisions that the Union demands that they adopt the countries of *Europa central and oriental.
Remains of self-evident that it is in #one of these fields, to know the threat that represents the existence of *tantas nuclear head offices, but also of #all armaments accumulated in the territory of the ancient Soviet Union, #where #any of States members #can not pretend, only, act in favour of security of the group of the continent.
Concerning the situation in *Alemania on the that *me has asked His *Señoría conversations with the competent minister of *Alemania *me have allowed, as I have said before, conclude that the Federal Government of *Alemania wishes to advance to the lifting of the prohibition and that the resultant conversations of difference with *Francia will dissipate #all worries that #can *subsistir in *Alemania.
#This is my answer: directive relative to nitrates covers no only the pertinent nitrogen of the animal muck, but also of the #fertiliser chemists regarding quantities employed, see article 5 and the annex *III, and to methods and periods of dissemination, that appear in the annexes *II and *III.
The Commission believes that the majority of measures that have to adopt States members -for example, supervision of transposition, the indication of the zones and the codes of fine behaviour, action programs and report presentation- are simple.
The reality is that -as it signals information supplied by the own #greek authorities- has produced an excessive presence of the Administration in the direction of company, and commitments of the year 1998 #would have to have put end, once and for all, to this situation.
Subject: legislative Harmonisation in the Czech Republic Has Commissioner knowledge of a study directed to the Commission elaborated by four #czech parties of the opposition in the that it examines the slowness of transposition and the legislative harmonisation in the Czech Republic and how conclusions extracts of #the same?
Another party that has governed before, #one of the great parties of the opposition, has said that it #can have adhesion to the letter; talks in addition to a #turkish status, of a political discount and wanted to *preguntarle #if it considers feasible models theoretical or #if it puts like previous condition the full application of the *acquis *communautaire.
Even *me *atrevería to say, in name of the Green\/European Free Alliance, that the majority of Group seems to have taken to the idea that the European Union #can develop common performances for the management of the crisis. But want to establish conditions and guidelines very defined for this management.
*Me #would enjoy to know, gentleman #Solana, #which are the political means, the economic and budgetary means -had account of the principle of "the that pay commands" , that *usted knows very well of his period of General Secretary of NATO-, to achieve strength that #can keep peace and avert situations so dramatic like the that have lived recently in the *Balcanes.
*Yo also consider the Council of the historical Monday, but in negative sense and by #others reasons and here *me refer to the incomprehensible adopted - position - with regard to an initiative, promoted by time by the European Union, #this is, the moratorium to death pity.
Gentleman Commissioner, is not very difficult to comprise that it that we had to have taken was to win supports through a serious negotiation, moderate countries that do not apply death pity, but that had positions and sensitivities with regard to the preamble - insist in reference preamble to article of the Letter of Nations Joined.
Have to say that the legitimate worry relative to the military capacity do not disappears with the "*europeización" of defence, that answers to a fundamental political plan and is look of process of political integration #european.
negotiation round on the world-wide trade has, therefore, an extraordinary importance and is precise that *Europa express in said negotiations with an alone voice, so that the world-wide trade also contribute to promote the growth social and environmentally sustainable.
First, because we have taken two important reforms in term of seven years -a big effort- and, second, because, to the contrary of sacrifices imposed to the #european agriculturalists, States Joined of *América have increased subventions in 15.000 millions of dollars, in the two last years, in self-evident contradiction with the arrogant attitude *propagandística that at present adopt against the *PAC.
Ask with *usted that deploy immediately the necessary humanitarian help to help to the *cientos of thousands of persons displaced by cause of the fights, but ask, gentleman Commissioner *Patten, that consider, in a *primer moment, a suspension of the economic help to *Rusia #if #this do not finds resource alternative to negotiation and #if it continues attacks *indiscriminados against the civil population.
Although of course we have to support the agricultural sector of the EU, as it recognises in the report of Mr. *Schwaiger, also have to recognise the need that the economies in development, in addition to reaching the markets, have to have access to the alimentary security so that the population have sufficient to eat.
Thus, am very satisfied with the Report *Schwaiger because precisely it signals that, to time that showed an open attitude to the world, owe *aferrarnos to it that for *nosotros has an essential value; and because this report tends, besides, a bridge among the political reality and it that *nosotros, in so much parliamentary, #can defend in front of citizens.
Have had two important conflicts -the of banana and the of hormones- that the European Union has lost, and there #be had conflict that not even *nos have brave to pose in front of solution system: *me refer to the #american laws *Helms-*Burton and *d' *Amato of application *extraterritorial to #european companies.
activity *pesquera effective -#who #can argue it?- constitutes, in spite of his reduced budgetary weight, part no *desdeñable of politics commercial and budgetary dynamics of the EU and has to consider like an autonomous economic sector and a significant branch for food supply.
In this sense is in the that are against of sectorial negotiations and in favour of global negotiations and are in favour that they see the *OMC and negotiations like an instrument for the creation of a juster society, of a more sustained development, in the that man was sure enough the centre of #all the decisions.
The greatest States of the EU as *Francia, *Alemania and Realm Joined had a volume of equivalent trade to roughly the 30% of #GDP in the years sixty, in comparison with the current 60%, but then enjoyed of an economic growth much faster that now.
In *tercer place, why differ norm negotiation, that demands with reason our civil society and that expect the countries in roads of development to integrate liberalisation of exchanges and development sustained, in fields like health, the environment and the fundamental rights of workers?
As they have underlined with relevance the two speakers, this next conference has to centre in the institutional subjects, in #all the institutional subjects, with the remarkable exception and politically essential of the debates in course on a #european politics of security and defence.
#Everything *ello #can guarantee it amendment that have presented jointly colleagues and *yo and in the that conclude and demand that the constitutional part of the Treaty include a catalogue of competitions that define and delimit clearly competitions of the Union and that impose respect of subsidiariness principle.
As a result of different samples of opposition and of environmental considerations have blocked dramas of road, and so much the national authorities like the Commission have initiated reflection to review the strategies in relation with the different means of transport and consider the rail link like a future network *transeuropea *prioritaria.
Now well, the past 13 September restarted dramas in road of valley, in spite of which, the European Union is a feasibility study of the *travesía rail and the Presidency in exercise affirms in program that has to consider *prioritaria reflation of the railway in *Europa.
My question, therefore, is #if they will follow forward by this disastrous path that no only affects to *Afganistán: the problem, in reality, is that the European Union continues funding the *PNUCD in the field, for example, of programs on hardening of the penal codes in countries like Chinese and *Birmania, countries in that the simple consumers of drugs are condemned to death and *nosotros, indirectly to *través of the *PNUCD, collaborate and fund this type of projects.
By the contrary, the Republic of *Chipre, in spite of being victim of the #turkish aggression since a 37% of territory is occupied of illegal form by army #turkish, do not imposes restriction to access to fuselage ports pertinent of ports situated in *Turquía.
attacks of the police to the peaceful demonstrations, that repeated constantly during the month of October in *Belgrado, show clearly that the fundamental values of democracy, as they are freedom of expression and of opinion, will not be respected in Serbian while *Milosevic and Government remain in power.
*Señorías, to finish want to remember that #if experience of the application of this Agreement *Interinstitucional will suggest that #some of looks have to go back to debate with the Institutions, is *algo that it will be able to take in the future Today, without embargo, consider that have the duty of no *restarle value to the signature with the that have recognised commitment to apply this Agreement *Interinstitucional.
The application of the five main indicators harmonised -demand of treatment by the *drogadictos; number of demises of *drogadictos, mortality and causes of demise among *drogadictos; incidence of illnesses *transmisibles related with drug; *comparabilidad of the surveys on drug utilisation, and behaviour and attitudes in front of drug in the population in general, and, finally, the *comparabilidad of estimates of the problem of the abusive use of drugs- exerts an important paper to this *respecto.
During decades, diverse governments, chosen but corrupt until marrow -the last was the of Mr. *Nawaz *Sharif- have allowed that in *Pakistán rape of the human rights, work in conditions *infrahumanas, the social catastrophe and an external debt *incontrolable are to the agenda and have destroyed the country.
These same governments have loaned support to diet fundamentalist of murderers #taliban in *Afganistán and constitute a permanent and immense danger for peace in the region, since they support and encourage the terrorist activities carried out against neighbours #indian in the border region of *Kashmir.
Regarding the specific points that *ustedes have posed in the relative resolutions to programs and to help projects to development to *Pakistán presented by the Commission, suits to underline that #this affect almost exclusively to the poorest coats and more disadvantaged of the population.
State, in attempts for facilitating a juridical base for the protection and deal of boys, has to accept the preeminent right of progenitors by it that refers to the protection, breeding and the *salvaguardia of children.
Second, have to demand *insistentemente to States members that work with methods and uniform data, so that it was possible to select the best models for the fight against drugs. Have to boost cooperation among the police and justice in the #european States to struggle against drug traffic and protect to youth.
Sure enough, the report of mate is important and has to be debated carefully, among things because discussion of the report has put of self-evident that drug politics in the European Union is #one of the most controversial subjects on the that we never have had to *pronunciarnos.
Thus I want to mention the importance that in work, that carries out under the auspices of the Union, include like central element an informative campaign allocated to youngsters, that today #can see induced to a large extent by mates of his same age and by persons to test substances that *les are presented like *inofensivas, as *algo that is not more harmful that take a glass more of beer or a bit more of *güisqui.
Gentleman President, the report of the speaker, Mrs. *Giannakou-*Koutsikou, on the action plan of the European Union in matter of fight against drug of the Commission is a categorical document in the that the European Parliament *opone clearly to drugs.
In effect, treats of a problem of today day and worrisome; know perfectly that drug affects to #all the countries and #all the social groups; know also that enlargement of *Europa to the East imposes, dramatically, the urgency of effective measures, since control, that already results difficult, will find greater difficulties; know that it treats of a problem in increase.
Recently my country, Realm Joined, has experienced an enormous increase of the arrival of persons; in my previous place of work like doctor in the Central Hospital of *Londres, #can observe that it had an important grade of illegal immigration and of fraudulent abuse of our generous politics of asylum.
*Me said Mr. #Martí, #one of vice-presidents, that the *BEI is property of States members and that, therefore, according to the Treaty is not an institution of the European Union that have the obligation to answer to the European Parliament, to the Court of Accounts or to *OLAF.
Anyway, the debate *me has seemed of big interest and expect that it that today have heard here was not obstacle, without embargo, so that we #can follow forward in the approval of the distribution of resources, of the distribution of loans, from the next year and that do not delay the community procedures.
After examining the *APIM\/*Arbitrio on production and and imports of Archipelago, the Commission concluded that although the majority of the economic sectors #can adapt to the requirements of the only market, the disappearance of the *APIM on 31 December of the year 2000 #can affect *irremediablemente to production sectors.
This situation and these proposals involve aging worrisome of the fleet *pesquera #european, deter to youngsters to invest, cause an important loss of market for the sector of dockyards skilled, weakening dangerously to #some of *ellos, and take to run an evident risk in matter of security to sailors shipped.
directive valid in matter of naval construction contains class of muddy regulations of help regarding investigation and development, the environment, innovation and the politics of regional support, with the consequence that it punishes to the fine dockyards and rewards to the bad.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, is an absolutely extraordinary fact that in the meeting of the Industry Council of the last week approved by unanimity the list of measures to delete the situation of disloyal competition created by the Republic of *Corea.
Europeans were the that open the world through navigation: Scandinavians in the north, the #portuguese and Spaniards to *América, *África and #Asia, Dutches, the #danish, English, the French have sailed #all waters with ships taken in earths and dockyards.
By it other, is impossible *evitarlas, but are of a political question very delicate and in this sense is important that the Commission and the Council know that in Parliament exists a big consensus in relation with this subject and a big worry on the need that we find a solution for the problem.
*Permítame *pedirle that transmit to #all the political leaders of *Irlanda of the North and as we #be to say in *Irlanda "of the side of puddle" , to Prime minister #british and to #all colleagues, and also to the *taoiseach #irish *Bertie *Ahern and to predecessors, the predecessors of parts, our sincere gratitude by it that *nos have helped to achieve.
Besides, this agency has to occupy , of course, to establish the list of products forbidden, watch laboratories, elaborate systems of control, establish controls out of competitions, exert repression, is to say, struggle against the mafias that devote to trade of products forbidden, but also of prevention so that youngsters *disocien psychological and actively of the *flagelo of doping.
My question is the following: understands the Commission that politics that has to develop in relation with sport, and especially with concentration to be able to that it generates in relation with the audiovisual means, has to conduct to a conjoint action among station and the that occupies of defence of competition?
*Yo *le #would ask to Parliament that intensify efforts for *presionar in this sense and procure to influence of cooperative way and *convincente on the Government, so as to that sport obtain a foundation in the Treaty, specifically -which #would be very desirable, since it also #would go oriented in the sense of subsidiariness- in terms that culture.
Some that talk of dates of adhesion seems difficult, although it #would be useful, extraordinarily useful, to boost to the public opinion of the countries affected, since it is increasingly evident a risk: some too much long negotiations #can cool enthusiasm so much in States members as in the countries candidates, as it remained patent in the recent polls made in *Polonia and as I #can check personally in this country, of the *cual returned yesterday.
Believe that we have to examine this question much more thoroughly for *presionar to the countries that have a shameful behaviour; have to call attention to the governments known like "*arrancadores of nails" , and the European Parliament has to be the institution that take the initiative to guarantee that the human rights appear among our main priorities.
But *déjenme say, to thread of it that have said the two orators that *me have preceded in the use of the word -with those who do not agree-, that the fact that *Europa, and in particular the European Union, take of the human rights flag, really his only flag, has greatness.
Gentleman President, this report of the Council deserves respect and there #be reason type to congratulate to the Presidency #finnish by stake. Although I have to say that I regret a lot that the delegation of the Presidency in exercise finish to abandon the hall.
With the right to life like central reason, the EU has to continue in his consistent line against of death pity and, through Nations Joined, has to challenge to the countries that consider ethical and morally *defendible the right of state to remove life to persons.
This evaluation has to analyse the situation of the human rights, pronounce on the available measures to improve the situation, review the effect that exert these measures in the situation and take estimates on the result of #the same, #as well as publish reports on assessments made and the results obtained.
Is hour to make the idea of the European Parliament on the creation, in breast of the Commission, of control organ on politics in matter of human rights that facilitated the execution of said political and informed on subjects related with the human rights.
In the *primer case, treats of finance in the three next years of a total of 135 millions of euros in virtue of article 130 of the Treaty of the European Community and that requires the application of a procedure of *codecisión, whereas in the second, that establishes for period commitment of 15 millions of euros, will be able to be object of a simple procedure of query.
In intervention in front of this Assembly on 13 October, Mr. *Prodi suggested that association for the similar adhesion to associations established with the countries official candidates also #would contribute to that *Turquía advance with greater firmness to fulfillment of adhesion criteria.
The majority of Parliament yes has taken it after heavy debates, since acceptance #would suppose stimulus so that Government #turkish reach an acceptable politics of human rights, a true democratisation and a political solution for the problem *kurdo.
*Yo believe that the report is very important because with *él the European Parliament adheres to the idea that the #european strategy constitutes a half adapted to expand relations among the European Union and *Turquía, and that the application of said strategy requires a financial support.
To mood to see, the true political priority is that they respect values limit in #all the zones, also in the of the called "hot points" and is precise to avert that some norms of wide exception open the door to that they do not move values limit applicable to the *benceno.
No treats, *Señorías, of *infundir fear, but is necessary -create *yo- take consciousness and take that it take consciousness of the dangers that run, #if we do not adopt now realistic measures and necessarily severe that present the less possible exceptions to evaluate, control and limit to the minimum broadcasts *contaminantes of these two harmful gases, so much more what that #this are more dangerous for boys, age persons and #all those that suffer cardiac or pulmonary conditions.

village, nation, #one *Europa that by correction badly understood do not conserve his own culture runs the risk to disappear, by it that ask to my colleagues that undo of leaf with the text of the EU and use the beautiful cards *UNICEF #such as they are.
*Nosotros also had a real house #whose sins are much more hovers of the current period, and wanted to declare, at least like spokesman of the Socialist Party *Panhelénico, that bear *nosotros is of the all inadmissible debate this type of things, because #this is to take part in questions very delicate, that have to debate in country before getting to the #european field.
And costs pity reaffirm that, regarding the content, follow struggling by the questions of the environment, the protection of consumers, the social rights, the human rights, the cultural diversity and paper *multifuncional of agriculture.

Is precise to endow to the European Union of politics *auténticamente democratic, oriented in favour of the human rights, that the convert in a stability factor, in factor in favour of peace, of development, of the human rights and of democracy in *Europa in the century *XXI.
Of course, #would be extraordinarily difficult and unfeasible request support of the #european public to introduce unanimity for changes in matter of fiscal harmonisation or for decisions relative to the questions of external politics and security in level of the European Council.
Also has conceded to *Turquía candidate condition for adhesion to the EU, although it will have to fulfil the political criteria established for the future adhesion, among *ellos the show, of course, that respect of the human rights is intrinsic part of the #turkish life.
The world is in roads to have a new *superestado at the side of the #EE.UU. Well is truth that has approved that the community army is not a community army because it do not has permanent existence; but in this case, neither exists a *Eurocuerpo or strengths armed of NATO.

Therefore, maybe #would not be of more that created work group that likewise informed to deputies of the existent possibilities in the European Parliament to guarantee security of members.
In the SAW Conference will have to take a decision on mood to guarantee the environmental correction like part of the global package of decisions, and the position of the relative Community to the subject of the maximum limits has not changed.
And *cuando say "to convince to partners", treats perhaps first of all to convince to the own countries of the European Union, because *Europa talks, but the fifteen States members of the European Union are had to make the necessary efforts and to respect, to apply, the numerous directives that vote here, in this hemicycle?

Gentleman President, in twilight of the century *XX, of a century that has been positively signalled by the peaceful revolution of women, is really regrettable that have still countries like *Kuwait and *Afganistán, in the that half of the population, women, is deprived even of the fundamental rights.
A resolution of nature on a Been member of the European Union #would have more felt that on a *tercer country, but #would constitute, even in this case, attack to the operation of the institutions of State and to the capacity of citizens to resolve internally this problem.

antecedent is the Decision 96\/411\/*CE of the relative Council to the improvement of the community agricultural statistics, that has put to disposal of the Commission a flexible tool that *le allows to adapt the statistical applications to the distinct needs of information to measure that go producing changes.
Obviously, the *lúpulo is not the typical example to appreciate the importance that has the Common Agricultural Politics for agriculturalists of the European Union, but shows depth and extension in assistance to agriculturalists.

In spite of the improvements that have introduced in legislation, especially the relative to boys born from 1992, seems that the political class leader in *Estonia is to keep a notion -in my conservative- opinion regarding the question of citizenship.

Likewise, consider fundamental for the work of Defender of Village -and like this signal it in the report- the modification of statute to achieve that access of Defender to #all the notable documents in the procedures that *él follows produce it more effectively possible.
Regarding performance of the office of Defender of Village in matter of information and communication, believe that said performance is a good example for other #european institutions, especially regarding utilisation of the new technologies of the communication, as, for example, approach of citizenship to this institution through Internet.
Is very important that examine in detail the Statute of civil servants and that introduce the necessary modifications to establish directly the obligation to civil servants to signal irregularities that #can perceive in the exert of functions about the operation of the community organs.
The Commission, nevertheless, had the intention to convert said code in #one of the three axes of a more ambitious reform of the group of his internal and external performances that, without embargo, has not been able to get still to good end by reasons that Parliament knows perfectly.
Regarding the modification of the Statute of Defender of Village, with regard to point or to the of testimonies of civil servants, obviously *le corresponds to Plenary take the initiative in accordance with article 138 And.

Of this drama, that #would have been able to avert, have to take out the consequences and exert pressures no only in front of *usted, gentleman Commissioner, but also in front of the Council, so that at last it develop a true political «railway-road» in the sector of commodity transports, and *ello so much for the difficult zones as for the group of the national territory.

Is regrettable that in places of the world, and also in *Irlanda of North, lawyers and judges have found in first line, #where conflicts are more intense. The murder of *Rosemary #Nelson *nos shows once again the danger that #many of professionals run *cuando defend the human rights more fundamental of customers.
The call in favour of an independent inquiry has to to the fact that has conviction that an inquiry of police #irish on death of Mrs. #Nelson #would not be all it rigorous that it #would have to be, as all indicates that Mrs. #Nelson feared by his own life and that during long considered in situation of grave danger.

#Many of the that here we are have been witnesses of his important action in Employment Commission and Social Subjects of Parliament, that was not but demonstration more of his constant dedication to the social and #sindical subjects that *le brought to this Assembly.
Certainly, the regulation of the privileges and immunities -that dates of the year 1965- traces back to moment in that Parliament was a mere parliamentary assembly in #where, still, grade of representativeness of a #european citizenship was in realm of utopia.
Today have the euro, today is indisputable that proposals are hit and that the report of colleague, Mr. *Menrad, that occupies of dimension of employment politics is also a very good report that it #can be argued here with the Report *Fourçans.
The solutions for the elimination of the chronic unemployment in *Europa are not in a #european program of employment neither in an economic politics, *homogéneamente configured, of States members of the Economic European Union and Monetary, but in the structural reforms.
Only there #be point, the relative to the structural reforms, on the that it wanted to call attention, for *precisarles that the Commission is had to value liberalisation of the sectors of telecommunications, transports and energy.
Gentleman President, distinguished colleagues of the European Parliament. As *ustedes know, on 19 April had already the opportunity to expose to Commission of Budgetary Control the position of the Council in approval procedure of the management for 1997.
See that they already have applied adequately the diverse disposals relative to staff and have understood that, of #all staff of the Centre, only remain vacancies two places of category To. do not hesitate it more minimum in recommending the approval of the management also for the *CEDEFOP.
Am surprised to see that the Socialist Group has presented amendment so that it delete point 1 of the Report *Elles, that is the important, is to say, in the that remember our final decision of not approving the management of the Commission of the year 1996.
But there #be had a problem, #can recognise that, *cuando have adopted in the political level clear decisions and oriented in the correct direction, the capacity of the Commission to apply the decisions in #all services of form has been mentally handicapped person.
From here, there #be another important principle that to *nosotros *nos links and that also has to see with responsibility bear with citizens of the that talked before: is conservation principle of acts, the principle to be it more effective possible and give the fastest and better answer to citizens.
Sure enough, have now precisely #this: emotion, but the scientific demonstration -and precisely as it has demanded, the qualitative security, no the quantitative- that the utilisation of hormones is harmful, that represents a threat for health, that is *cancerígena, that causes the early apparition of puberty of girls. Translate it that is written here.
And of here also that *yo defend the creation of compensation bottom for companies that see affected by sanctions, since, of it contrary, #many of *ellas #can see immersed in a deep crisis that #can *llevarlas to the disappearance, with the consequent loss of places of work precisely in moments in that we are -want to promote from the Union- politics in benefit of occupation.
#If the Commission yields the evaluation and initiative capacity for new proposals as it occurs in this proposal, then is really existence right and is in fact it that it is a principle determinant in the Union, and east is the right of initiative.
Thanks to the community spirit have been possible in *Europa right State, dialogue, the democratic institutions, recognition of minorities, and with this spirit #can put end also to conflict that carries *martirizando to villages of the *sudeste #european from takes more of ten years.
The Greens expect of *usted, gentleman *Prodi, regarding Parliament, that engage in the Conference *Intergubernamental to bet firmly for strengthening this House until it was plenary Parliament right, with full powers of *codecisión legislative also in matter of agriculture and of compulsory costs, and with plenaries right of control of the application of politics.
This cure of *adelgazamiento has to make before the nomination of the new Commission, by it that exist reasons general to postpone the approval of Mr. *Prodi, without embargo, my group also has a political reason: Mr. *Prodi wishes States Joined of *Europa.
In #some moments, the problem of the balance among these two looks has found #any solution; for example, Mr. *Delors treated to *través of the White Book to take a synthesis and to find balance point, looked for the balance among these two looks.
*Europa has not set up still analysis cell for the active politics of prevention of conflicts -like European Parliament approve a proposal of this type- has to recover the dignity, the ambition and responsibility of an initiative.
Think that it is necessary to restore a true monetary flexibility and adapt the euro to the specific situations of the different countries leaving *subsistir, on 1 January 2002, the national coins in front of the euro, that #would convert like this in a simple common coin.

Gentleman President, have received of the office of President of Parliament a letter that *me says that my question directed to the Council, that had to debate tomorrow, will not debate then because today it #would take place the debate on *Kosovo and in *él #would include also my question, that refers to the question of the environment in *Kosovo, that has been *auténticamente destroyed.
Loan, instead, attention to the #european voices day more numerous, stronger and more significant, of *Oskar *Lafontaine to the 180 #italian deputies of the democrat majority of left, #christian democrats, that, in name of #one vision of *Europa, ask, to the equal that take *nosotros, the end of bombardments.
Are practical in the short term: support the initiative of *Chernomirdin, *salvaguardar *Montenegro of bombardments in measure of it possible, keep the demographic balance in *Macedonia with the received of #kosovar refugees in the EU, so that it #can not produce climbing of conflict in the region and, gentleman President, contain the transport of arms for the *UCK as it has taken #Italia.
Have to begin to explain to Mrs. *Harbour -and is the Council the one who has to take it- that #if *Hitler had not been accused because it #can not test #who were the bosses of the distinct fields of extermination, #would not have been able to show control chain existent among *Berlín and *Auschwitz.
It that it has to occur is that, *eventualmente with the peace agreement of the that talked right now Mr. Minister, in the *Balcanes define conditions to establish right State and democracy, the eradication of #all the sources of aggression that in instant exist, especially in diet of *Milosevic.
The situation is extremely difficult and only intervention armed -#if before *Milosevic do not yields with regard to conditions imposed by NATO and the European Union- #can give break and create cord of protection with seen to this space of peace and security of the that have talked.
In the next days, will go back to go to the region, without embargo, *les pray that *nos help to transmit this message: for the time being, the fundamental element of the humanitarian help are the elections *prioritarias, discipline and coordination, of it contrary fear that also the big generosity of #all finish in a big confusion.

The position expressed this morning by Mr. *Prodi and what *nos has said now President in exercise of the Council on the importance that for hit of the great political of the Union, like enlargement and the *PESC, will earn the Russian Federation in the immediate future *nos fill of hope.
This common strategy proposes democracy, right State of the public institutions, integration of *Rusia in an economic and social space European and the imperative common that confronts the #european continent.
In this sense, is particularly important that leave clear in front of the Council that approval procedure of a report with recommendations to the Council on a common strategy constitutes an exceptional solution, motivated by the particular circumstances of an electoral year.
efforts of *Rusia to reach a solution of conflict of the *Balcanes do not take more that highlight once again the importance of said country for the #european architecture of security and, in consequence, *yo back explicitly the wishes of President of the Council that it adopt it before possible this strategy.
The text of section 5 of article 190 of the Treaty says that «Parliament will establish the statute and the general conditions of exercise of functions of members, previous *dictamen of the Commission and with the approval by unanimity of the Council».
*Yo believe that the Council -and the Governments- have shown his fine will regarding Parliament, in the first place accessing to *algo that *nosotros believed that it was very difficult, that is the inclusion in the Treaty of *Amsterdam of article precisely, that ask from Parliament and that #all believed that the Council -or the Governments- did not go to accept.

With regard to Parliament, wanted to say also that the characteristic note of this term of office is that we have left trousers short -am from my masculine condition, and therefore I put this example of trousers short, of course, without going in in any example *sexista-.
But above #everything *eso, recognise that it is *usted man of firm convictions, that has qualities human natural; person of big energy and determination and person that always has shown positive and *ecuánime; person *alentadora and also person that #can be very firm and authoritarian *cuando it is necessary to show this type of authority, as we have witnessed in #some occasions.
The pact has to be expression of an active politics of labour market that bet more that up to now by the avoidance of unemployment, is to say, especially, by the reduction of the juvenile unemployment and of long length #as well as by the ending of discrimination of women in the labour market.
events occurred at the beginning of this year and that have conducted to the resignation of the Commission and to a debate on reform, are reason to examine in this context also relation among the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission.
delay in the reinforcement of the institutions and of operation only #can engage the effective enlargement of the Union; this new reform has to prepare to the institutions for enlargement, but has to allow also answer to #some failures of institutional operation that have appeared in the last months.
Of course, do not put in cloth of trial #some fundamental looks like article *N, but that say that in the preparatory stage are necessary novelties because we have checked deficiencies of method *intergubernamental and, therefore, the need to prepare of form the result of the Conference *Intergubernamental.

Among the central elements of the reform package includes enlargement of politics for development of the rural area, included a better impulse to the compatible economic methods with the environment.
Thus, has not been surprising that before Colony summit of #one or spot have come from critical to the strategy of the Presidency or to mood to carry negotiations, but after the summit of *Berlín assessment is totally different.
Expect that it concretise the political will affirmed by *Prodi to recover the institutional balance to end to allow that the Commission go back to exert his indispensable paper of political impulse, like independent organ of the national governments and of the private interests.
Lady Speaker, in plane of the procedure, wanted to signal to Mr. *Cox and to Mrs. *Green, although they have gone, that *yo presented, on 13 December, amendment of type that the global amendments, that already have debated amply, and that this amendment in moment - perhaps because it was #mine -, was declared inadmissible.

Freeze the third category; in the *cuarta only offers a statement by #if the crisis of *Kosovo needed a review of the financial perspectives, and *nos announces that the Council #would be had to accept a review before the entrance in vigour of the financial perspectives that want that we adopt today.
*Me seems that also the *isleños coincide with the wide majority of Parliament and of the Commission in that the principle of the economic and social cohesion shows especially in deal that gives to structure regions feebler, by it that we want to assign to these regions the 70 % of #all credits, so much #if they live in firm earth as in islands.
#If we are sincere #one with #others, know that it do not has any sense take only of the *insularidad look of the that derive helps, as game point of the structural helps, like this appears also in the Treaty, is to compensate the disadvantages of regions and social groups and is to #this to it that *nos have to adhere in his own interest.
Here has to take part Diary 2000 to provide the indispensable means for his *prosecución with infrastructures *cofinanciadas by the *FEDER, by the *FEOGA-Orientation or by Cohesion Bottom, #as well as training or reallocation of drama hand, for it that requires support of the Social Bottom.

Believe that the Social Bottom European is a half to give support to development of employment in *Europa, to the equal that bottom for the rural development is a half that it will be able to take possible the big toning that will have to take great parts of the agricultural sector.
In any case, appreciate also efforts that has made the salient Commissioner, the one who carried out a very hard work, no only to hour to visit the regions depressed of the Union, but -especially- in #everything it relative to *Irlanda of the North and to programs *transfronterizos.
Like speaker for the approval of the management of 1997 in relation to bottoms, wanted to signal a problem that is the that a country as, for example, *Holanda, continuously sees reflected negatively in the reports of the Court of Accounts, due to the fact that there have a more precise form to inform that in any #another country.
To end to achieve this goal, the Commission is had to incorporate the most modern media so that Parliament #can exert scrutiny of continuous way and using the technical means more recent.
have reached important progresses in the debate on the definition of content and incorporation to the juridical foundations of the constitutive Treaty of the European Community and of the Treaty of the European Union and fault little so that we #can give it by finished.
Without embargo, in political questions so important like the incorporation of the Agreement of *Schengen and the association Agreement with two countries of special significance, believe that the Council #would owe *haberlas subjected to query of Parliament and #would have to have taken into account sight points that had been able to expose this institution.
Arise doubts regarding security, the operation, payment, treatment of the confidential information, the abuse of personal data, the quality of products and advice fault.
Support the amendments that improve the directive, without embargo, do not support the legislative text in group and the June Movement neither supports the legislative text in group because it follows splitting of the principle that takes reference to the country of the *remitente.
Is true that, in electronic matter, precisely by the big rape of privacy that #can suppose the fact that we introduce in our houses computer and that, in the screen, children, friends, our familiar #can see exposed to information bombardment, probably no wished, takes that they appear principles of public order.
A possibility #would be the to approve the report now and retain the communication to the Council until the Committee of the Regions decide #if it pronounces or no to the *respecto, and another possibility #would be to postpone the vote to morning, as it seems that the Committee of the Regions #can give a favourable report morning.

Our external politics and of common security has worked correctly in this case as this statement was important to guarantee the peaceful and constructive continuation of the peace process in spite of the expiration of the *primer interim period fixed by the Agreements of *Oslo.
Consider, without embargo, that has got moment of an extraordinary action: wanted to take advantage of this famous year 2000 -a year that has a big symbolic value for #all the countries of the world and no only for the that have tradition, history and religion- to carry out an extraordinary gesture.
As it finishes to remember the colleague *Imbeni, has got hour to use also this year 2000 to give this qualitative jump and present to the General Assembly of Nations Joined a proposal of universal moratorium.

Gentleman President, the existent difficulties to punish to those who have incurred in offences #such like genocides, crimes of war and, in general, offences against humanity have shown *sobradamente the need of instauration of an International Penal Court, that was active what before and in conditions to proceed effectively to persecution of offences so that they do not follow *impunes.

Quote of the report of the International Commission for *Temelin. In this moment, production capacity is upper to the needs and electricity produced by the nuclear head office of *Temelin so only will serve to reduce production in other fields.

Our position, no only in relation with the textile industry but with the productive system European in general, adjusts to the need, first, that the sector has to accept conditions of a global economy, and, second, that has to take effort to increase productivity levels and of competitiveness.
In *tercer place, is a big misfortune that after having spent so much money of the taxpayer in this new building, #can not give true example for the century *XXI -for the new #millenium- of the type of open society that the European Parliament wants to see in the future.
treats no only of a *combatiente *encarnizado of democracy in country, of a big man that has helped in decolonisation process and to build a juster world and more open, but that also embodies admirably dimension -say- sportive, that it is necessary *reconocerle to democracy.
To #all *nos costs a lot understand #which was this message of the Commission, apart from that for resales supposes fine #news, and bad #news for fans to football, that give to understand that #one #can go out really with the #his and *infringir the law always that it was had to give some *monedillas to the European Commission in a back moment of the process.

In name of my political Group want to say very clearly that we do not go to *enjuiciar to the Commission and to the new Commissioners by his political membership but by capacity, clarity and accuracy of positions in the past and in the present.

In particular, will have to find an apt system to guarantee the continuous and exhaustive information of Parliament on course of reform respecting, to time, autonomy of the Commission in the management of competitions.
do not share this analysis: for me the Conference *Intergubernamental is a crucial appointment for the #european Institutions and is our opportunity, the last perhaps, for *prepararnos for the possible duplication of the number of members of States of the Union.
*Le propose that *reflexione on the need to correct route, and the two banks of proofs *me seems that they have suggested in this debate: the first refers to relation among *Europa and the world, the second refers to *Europa among the #european construction and the different realities of the distinct countries.
enlargement presupposes adaptation of the institutions of the Union: have begun already the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental of the countries members with the goal to take a report on this subject, of #whose editorial will commission President and that it will be exposed in the summit of *Helsinki.
In the summit of *Tampere, that will treat, among things, the problems of shelter and of the political asylum, #as well as of the international delinquency organised, it will be necessary to take concrete propositions of measures to take to improve the internal security.
Have to accelerate by #all means the preparation of said report and his owed discussion in the European Parliament, but #can not deliver the legitimate rights of Parliament in hands of an organ of unofficial investigation neither *atenernos to diary to elaborate the report.
politics to follow for the»#nordic dimension», concept already ratified by the European Union, has to take into account, among things, collaboration with the countries *Bálticos, and also the materialisation of the strategy to follow with *Rusia, subject that also has been decided in principle.
This goal sees *desmoronado by the principle according to the *cual the EU has to have a will, politics and an only voice. This principle was refused by the 70 percent of Finns that have not voted in the elections of the European Parliament.
Nobody has talked of *ello before me, but exists a problem that has not confronted or at least no with the determination wished by the European Union: is the of the three one thousand #kosovar prisoners, literally *raptados by Mr. *Milosevic and his *esbirros during the last days of the international intervention in *Kosovo and moved by strength to prisons of Serbian.
The External Politics and of Common Security will allow to reach, from the *Balcanes, with urgency and obstinacy that, for the time being, imposes the situation, the goals of peace, of the economic welfare, of certainty of respect of the human rights.
Entrust in that it was reconstruction no only material, but also immaterial: reconstruct roads, schools, ports, aqueducts, but also the confidence of persons that during years have seen deprived of the right to live with affections in earth, with work and that today aspire to achieve carry this calm life that *les was denied during years.
As, *acaso #can admit a situation in that a Commission *demisionaria follow exerting functions from the past month of March and taking part to try weaken the application of an only price of book and to formulate the mandate of the next negotiation in the *OMC, #whose importance for the coming years is known?
In fact, suspect that #many of colleagues are not so *duchos in technology as they had to be, but technology goes to have an enormous effect in the opening of the only market and before that at all we owe *asegurarnos that legislation no limit the capacity of persons for *innovar and introduce changes and new forms of electronic trade.
The 29 June 1999, to President of the Commission, Mr. *Santer, *le communicated the decision of Mr. *Bangemann to leave the Commission to assume place in the private sector two days later, on 1 July 1999.
Believe that now we have to have value, that have to ask value of the Council and of the Commission, in the first place to learn of errors of the past, to cut with the agricultural politics carried out up to now, and take finally an election rope, wise and necessary by a #european agriculture of quality.
How many times will be still require that have accidents repeated, in this type of utilisations, so that it put end to this absurd system according to the *cual earths are in fallow, agriculturalists need to work, take live heritage and the landscape of #ours *Europa, but find in the inability to take it because *privilegia utilisation of waste recycling and, in particular, of animal wastes.

Excellent the statement on the need of a *Kosovo *plurinacional; now well, the that the resolution advocate that this national plurality was guaranteed by the *UCK do not seems of receipt, unless it was necessary to interpret it in key of humour #black.

Ladies and Gentlemen, believe that for the European Union, in matter of sport, today is *prioritario avert that it sanction to a country member that reached to organise with hit this event, and initiate in particular, as it said it yesterday Roman *Prodi, a true #european fight against doping, for example; is to say, deny to that only the logic of money finish with beauty and the own spirit of sport.
*Cuando in these last time, the European Parliament has treated to strengthen control on the Commission, and theory of the independence had to, as, as it is logical, retreat, see like #this *resurge and strengthens with a new strength; no already regarding commissioners, but to services.
With spirit, the Commission goes to answer to the report establishing service of internal audit, as it recommends the Committee, and reiterate commitment for reinforcing the financial cells in #all the general directions.
For me today is satisfaction reason -that want to take public- have listened in this Assembly to the still Commissioner #Manuel *Marín refer to the future of the Commission with honesty of the that has taken #gala along mandates and with dignity with the that has assumed the problems of the previous School of Commissioners.
Want to finalise my intervention appreciating to Mr. *Marín his big work during #all these years in responsibilities in the Commission and the last, especially, like President in functions of the Commission and *deseándole to Mr. *Kinnock luck, touch and good tempt in the difficult tasks that *le expect in the next months and years.
Expect to develop action program for reform together with the responsible Commissioner and although we have not had time to study it in detail, believe that it #would be just *pedirle to Commissioner a debate and a clear justification of why do not undertake measures #if #some of the recommendations remain excluded.
. Gentleman President, in reality, in the report that has presented Mrs. #Jackson there #be point that do not refers so much to the content as to the juridical form that #can choose to try resolve the problem of the environmental minimum criteria in States members.
Is just to affirm that in the past existed the opinion generalised that the European Parliament and the European Commission had to work almost in state of permanent collusion to take charge of the rights purchased of States members and boost like this the #european integration.
Is an ideal fight to give to Europeans the sense of a common destination, of a common mission, of a common identity, of a common civilisation and of a common homeland.
Wish to remember also that competitiveness of agriculture no measures only in the world-wide markets, but also to the light of the balance of the territories, of the maintenance of the rural tissue and of the conservation of the natural heritage.
Gentleman President, the great challenges that *nos expect - enlargement, the deepening in a #european reality that respect the national identities by means of a new approach of subsidiariness, the *salvaguarda of agriculturalists, the construction of #one *Europa more human in matter of employment and more generous - are of importance that is precise that the confront together.
The group of the subjects that have debated *nos allow to express our vote of confidence with regard to it that Mr. *Prodi has defined "a new start" : a common expression that *atañe to the Commission, but that, to trial, also concerns to this new Parliament.

Second, in audience occupied an important space no only the pending subjects regarding enlargement of the Union, but also the inclusion of the agricultural model European in the future negotiations in the frame of the *OMC to scale international and especially defence.
In deputy quality of a border region among *Bélgica, *Alemania, *Luxemburgo and the Low Countries, *yo #can *transmitirles the expectations of Europeans in the field of the daily life, but especially also his *incomprensión in front of the countless fetters that still exist among States members.
#Some of His *Señorías will remember definitely that *Yannos *Kranidiotis was deputy to the European Parliament of January of 1995 to February of 1997, date in the that it was appointed Prime minister of the Government of #Grecia and will remember that in Parliament was member of the Commission of External Subjects and of Budget Commission, as also vice-president of the Delegation in the Mixed Parliamentary Commission European Union\/*Chipre.

The #european judicial network is, undoubtedly, the less developed of the three areas that *nos occupy and, in this sense, believe that the creation of a stable unit, attendant to give continuity to the judicial cooperation and to be the judicial speaker of *Europol, #can be adapted.
Lady Speaker, our presence here in *Estrasburgo has origin in the extraordinary tradition of #Robert *Schuman, #whose Community of Coal and of Steel no only meant an important step to the economic integration, culminated recently with the arrival of the euro, but that also *redundó in benefit of the political integration.
As well, in the Summit of *Tampere the Council has the opportunity to create *algo #as well as a community of coal and of steel of justice, freedom and security in breast of our European Union.
Therefore, *yo believe that it is indispensable that in *Tampere take decisions that *clarifiquen the situation, that are steps to forward on the decision, already positive, adopted in Colony; on character, on the content, on relation with the Conference *Intergubernamental, on preparation procedures and on the own approval of the Letter of fundamental rights.

Or, and *eso *me seems more #likely, is that the budgetary authority, to hour to elaborate the budgets, do not takes into account in sufficient measure credit needs and capacity of real absorption of the different programs?

Like this as, to ensure security alimentary in front of it unknown, believe that further of practice of the scientific committees as it takes too much in States Joined - and it *deploro, even among *nosotros, in the European Union - with decisions adopted to enclosed door, is precise first of all guarantee a true and complete information to consumer already from production sources.
As it is obvious, share premises of the decision *nº 640 of date Commission 23 September 1999, in the *cual *recalcó that, according to the WHO, dioxin is #one of substances more *cancerígenas that exist, reason by the *cual the WHO has recommended to keep a daily dose admissible the same to 1-4 *picogramos by kilogram of corporal weight.
difficulty *nos #can pose for the next year and, in fact, in the own decision of the Commission, #if his *Señorías see in page 7, in section 4 the reference to this subject, says of form very clear that, given the existent budgetary restrictions, #can pose #any difficulty and an adjust in category 4.
The upper increase to the average registered in *Dinamarca, in *Alemania and also in *España *nos shows the narrow relation that exists among conditions of access to networks and increase taxes of the corresponding part to electricity pertinent of sources of renewable energy.
Receive with *beneplácito the amendment *n1 6 to the letters and) to) (new) of article 2 on the need to boost the export of technologies for the renewable energies of the European Union and boost to the European Council of Export of Renewable Energies.
In the first place, an energetic politics according to the environment, an energetic politics that bet by the future of our planet, is *algo that it has to be present no only in the energetic politics but in politics #worthy of this name *cuando are in primes of the century *XXI.
By it that refers to the amendment 6, wanted to remember here the favourable received of the Commission to the report presented by Parliament on the new perspectives of the European Union in matter of export of technology and services for utilisation of the renewable energies *cuando was presented in Plenary of the past 15 January.
According to the valid economic principles, the offer of cheap energy is totally incompatible with the reduction of consumption. In context measures allocated to boost saving energetic tend to *difuminarse.
Regarding recommendation proposal for the *segunda reading, wish to take two considerations and remember that program *SAVE is oriented mainly to improve investigation and the exchange of technical knowledges, #as well as to supervise and control the results reached in the sector (article 2), although with endowment limited of financial resources.
Gentleman President, want to appreciate again to Parliament, and very especially to Mrs. *Ahern, work made and support reiterated to politics of the Commission, specifically regarding the improvement of utilisation of energy and to the increase of the energetic efficiency that contemplates program *SAVE.
The past week make a series of significant changes in the maximum administrative levels of the Commission, on the base of a concrete cultural change of nomination systems.
Have to add that so much gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen as *yo have the intention to act so that, in the future, the Commission centre in the most horizontal questions of the business politics, because the sectorial speeches the leave for decision organs.
Of form will be able to establish #if the decision of the #french Government took on the base of new facts, in #whose case will have value, or #if, by the contrary, took against of the general norms and then is clear that it will have to withdraw of form or of #another in the next hours.
In February of 1998, as a result of criticisms of Appeal Organ of the *OMC, the Commission launched 17 studies with the end to facilitate supplementary information concerning the risks in sectors #such as toxicology, the undue use and the environmental looks.
Am convinced that Parliament goes to exert an essential paper in the debates that go to take place in a next future, especially *cuando after the decision of *Helsinki to concede to *Turquía candidate status, begin the wide process of approximation of legislations, of the "*screening" .
Finally, #all, or the majority of *nosotros, know that diet of the individual freedoms, of press freedom, diet in prisons and of the police interrogations of *Turquía do not have at all that see with democracy in the #european civilisation.
is not sufficient politics of the promises: it that serves is politics of the concrete facts, respect of the human rights, the abolition of death pity knowing, without embargo, that the question *kurda is not a #one question that affects to *Turquía exclusively.
The question of security, without embargo, #can not hide illegality of the military occupation or of bombardments against the civil personnel like the that they produce in the south of the *Líbano, or prison existence like the of *Qian, although it follows being *prioritaria the #palestinian question.
help of the European Union to *Cisjordania and Strip of *Gaza among 1994 and 1998 elevated to a total of 1.500 millions of euros and help of the European Union to Organism of public dramas and aid of Nations Joined during period rose to roughly 505 millions of euros.
Lady Speaker, the proposal of the Conference of Presidents for session calendar of the European Parliament for the year 2000 got to my hands only after the closing of term for the presentation of amendments.
In moment *me gave account that there #be a *plenario in *Estrasburgo, specifically the of 12 June of the 2000, that coincides with Monday of *Pentecostés, that is a day of official party, and therefore day no working in varied of States members of the European Union, that are *Bélgica, *Dinamarca, *Alemania, *Francia, *Luxemburgo, Low Countries, *Austria and *Suecia.
Gentleman President, in the first place, want to say that I am very satisfied with this vote on the calendar, no owing to a governmental commitment, like the colleague *Berthu, but because I am convinced that only by means of the full use of the labour week will keep work capacity, is to say, #if of Thursday do not takes Friday.
Make, simply, a distinct assessment of the principle of caution. As it occurs often, the Commission gives a high grade of priority to the free circulation of products, and is interesting to check that, by time, *Francia situates the alimentary security of citizens to an even more high level.
Wanted to that it cooperate immediately of a much more intense mood with *Turquía of it that has taken up to now, that release the financial protocols and that take reality a narrow cooperation to level underneath of the full adhesion, whereas #that that have voted in favour of the resolution, propagate in part the goal *incumplible of a full adhesion so that they #can *utilizarla to humiliate and *vejar to *Turquía.
President of the Commission left clear orientation, *cuando, in the investiture speech, affirmed that it was necessary to follow restructuring the Only Market and boosting liberalisation and underlined on purpose the continuation of the process of liberalisation of sake sectors and services.
Therefore, #would expect of the Commission and of States members that, in the new editorial of the text of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, established an independent and impartial system of solution of controversies that no *nos put in front of feet of horses as it has occurred in the past.
Thus, want to suggest two things: in the first place, #would owe *adherirnos to the requirement of the colleague *Lange to coordinate closely with Parliament trade on broadcasts, as a so gigantic interference in the commercial politics is hardly to carry out against Parliament.
#Such as it stipulates in article 6 of the Treaty on the European Union, the Union bases in the common principles to States members of freedom and democracy, of respect of the fundamental rights and of the basic freedoms, #as well as in the of Right State.
How measured thinks to adopt the Council to guarantee the rigorous fulfillment of the community legislation in this field? Has the Council the intention to urge to the Commission so that it incorporate to the community legislation the recommendations of the *ICCAT?
Finally, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, want *preguntarle #if the fact that number -and *usted *me will say #which- of #european ships have substituted mesh networks to the derives by other *artes of high performance means greater protection for the *pesquerías of tuna or #if, by the contrary, is the contrary effect of the that wanted, is to say, an increase of pressure on the populations of *túnidos.
To the approve the new rule of the structural Bottoms the past month of June, the Council determined in the basic regulation the main goals, the general principles and the programming procedures for the period 2000-2006.
But like the Council *le commissioned to the Commission the application of rule, the Council do not has competitions to determine the strategies to follow in the different sectors of the peripheral regions of the Goals 1 and 2, that are under this rule.
In moment in that a North American study reveals racial inequalities in the administration of death pity in *Filadelfia, the North American Government #would honour in taking position against this flagrant rape of the International Agreement of Civil Rights and Politicians.
Therefore the Commission has *preconizado in the past in his White Book on the *descongestión of the aerial space European, that the aerial space European has to be object of a central management carried out by a strong international organisation that occupy of #all looks of use.
Is necessary to devote more bottoms to the alternative energetic resources and when seeming has the impression of that in the future will happen of the utilisation of solid fuels and oil to the natural gas and to sources of renewable energy and of generation of electricity.
have not gone it sufficiently fast, because treating of civil servants think that it was useless to expect to finals of October to take a decision of application with regard to agents of Parliament; had sufficed a simple decision of the Table, adopted on the base of section 5 of article 22.
My colleague, Mr. *Wuermeling, has cleared already with reason that the directive leaves in hands of States members determine, when an electronic statement of will that goes. *Provista of a digital signature has to equate to a statement with handwritten signature or to a statement for the *cual the Law prescribes form written.
In the field of security and of technology, without embargo, *revisten a big importance the technical data, parameters, characteristics and materials that use, #as well as maintenance levels and programming terms.
How presupposed is the that links until point to the budgetary authority with legislative acts, that #some figures, #some great reflected in the legislative acts and in programs are so *vinculantes that tend to reduce the budgetary procedure to a group of legislative arbitrations already effected?
In costs of Parliament is inscribed reservation of 7,4 millions of euros referent to leases of building *Belliard, because lease agreement among the owner and the *arrendatarios, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, even is not concluded.
#If it concludes lease agreement before the end of the year, will deduce the sum quoted of the budget of Parliament; in fact, the budget of Parliament represents in this moment the 20,11% of the *rúbrica 5 and the maximum limit fixed by the own Parliament is of the 20%.
Seems that they also #would have to reassign endowments allocated to humanitarian help for *Kosovo, specifically because big part of refugees has gone back already to *Kosovo and because the humanitarian help #would constitute a *primer step in the path of reconstruction of *Kosovo, providing, in game point, the protection to persons during winter.
Second, by the contrary, in the three proposals, forecasts for possible new commitments are in part very inferior to the amounts *homónimos for the present year. And #this although it foresees a big increase of games relative to actions in the frame of the *preadhesión, or was, credits for candidates to adhesion.
Appreciate commitment that have shown in the fight against fraud in the European Union and, in particular, the supplementary commitment that have decided: Budget Commission has voted in favour of a supplementary quantity of 9 millions of euros for the *OLAF.
*Nos occupy of energy programs, the relative to industry, included small and medium enterprises, investigation programs made inside programs mark, which *equivale, of course, to pretty much the 60% of cost in internal politics of the European Union, and lines on trade and technical assistance.
Using quantities decided the past year by means of conciliation on the report *Whitehead, the budgetary lines devoted to questions of consumption will follow generating confidence in the public opinion, *dándoles tranquility that no only are #one *Europa opened to businesses, but that also take campaign in favour of the rights of citizens like consumers.
Step now in brief to transport, #if *me allow it, only to say to deputies that expect that they #can support the initiatives of Budget Commission for *restituir cuts in line devoted to security in transport and cuts in line on sustainable mobility.
Share rejection of the speaker regarding the proposal of the European Commission to organise from now cooperation for development through some geographic lines and to reduce the thematic budgetary lines.
Still there #be #one or two countries in the that the Commission and Parliament follow separated regarding the structure and have to be especially alerts in the cases in the that more of the 75% or the 80% of credits devote to pay wages and buildings in place of to some suitable informative politics.
In the field of this strategy *nos pleases to take note that *Timor constitutes #one of the priorities of this budget and, in particular, *nos *congratulamos of acceptance by the speaker of registration of a new line to confront reconstruction of this territory, as, by it other, proposed and approve in Development Commission and Cooperation.
Simultaneously, without embargo, have to treat to modify the contents and the logic of the budget with sight put in the challenges that the Union will have in front of yes in the next years and, especially, in the fact that the true enemy to beat in each #one of States members is unemployment.
An active presence of the European Union in the world-wide stage and his convinced availability to progressive politics of enlargement also to the *Europa *suroriental, to the *Balcanes in this perspective of enlargement virtual and parallel of peace and of security outlined by Mr. President *Prodi, are #one of the #few and safe guarantees of stability and prosperity in *Europa that #can not be neglected.
Still is not concluded evaluation work of the costs of reconstruction of *Timor Oriental, #as well as of the back financial plan international of support, by it that still is not possible a calculation *cabal of the #european participation in the costs of reconstruction.
So that the incorporation to the EU constitute a notorious and profitable change for citizens, will be necessary to change the reality, that companies and employees believe a labour market so dynamic like just for workers.
The Agreement *Interinstitucional constitutes a good common legacy for the preparation of the Budget 2000 and for a fine collaboration, and in this sense, after the present debate, *yo have confidence that we will achieve to reach of common agree a solution shared and a responsible budget for the year 2000.
Some contradictory messages about the decisions adopted by #ECB and of the underlying reasons #can cause market expectations *injustificadas and increase uncertainty, going like this against of the same goal of transparency with regard to development of the monetary politics.
Wanted to *recalcar that information provided in press conferences celebrated after the meetings of Government Council, together with the analysis included so much in the Monthly Bulletin of #ECB as in the #others channels of communication approximates a lot, in it essential, to the publication of records *resumidas" .
Guarantee the fine public management in finances is a half to improve the stability conditions of prices and to achieve a solid sustainable growth that give place to employment generation.
#ECB has to be watchdog, but like inflation tax half of the euro-11 follows still far of level of the 2 %, believe that I #can expect that the Council of Governors give an opportunity to growth and, therefore, to a supplementary reduction of unemployment.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, before that at all we have to analyse the *primer period of activity of the Central Bank European that, as #all know, initiated career takes a year with hope to convert , with time, in a fundamental institution to take part in the economy of States members of the Union.
Simultaneously, without embargo, will have to watch price stability to be able to control this greater evil that #all know, or was, inflation, #as well as keep low interest types to boost investments and reactivate the #european industrial sector converting it in competitive regarding States.
And *eso has carried to #some to talk of species of platonic aristocracy of a series of independent experts to the that it entrusts the decision on the monetary politics thinking -probably with reason- that money is too much serious so that *nos occupy of *ello politicians.
Also the publication of the summaries of the meetings of the Administration Council is a fundamental act, but these summaries have to show with clarity justifications of the decisions adopted so that agents of the market #can adopt also his own decisions.
Concerning coins - will know that *yo do not have responsibility on coins, #this is a question for economy ministers - the big difference resides in that it is impossible to obtain guarantees in it that concerns to coins, since coins are put in circulation, generally, by sale sector and no by the banks.
*Colombia expects can fund jointly with the countries that of #one or form see connected to the chain of business of drug, infrastructure of project and wait, likewise, link the private capital, so much national like foreigner, to the economically productive companies so that they incorporate advanced technologies and new capitals.
(*PT) Lady Speaker, *Señorías, in the conclusions of *Tampere combine a firm political message on the priority conceded to the construction of a Space of Freedom, Security and Justice and worry for establishing priorities centred in the questions that affect directly to the daily life of citizens.
The Commission proposes with taste act in the sense to apply the ambitious program of action of fight against capital bleaching, that comports modifications so much in the external position of the Union as in plane of legislation of each #one of States members.
*Yo believe that it is #one of the basic freedoms that we have to defend, and in this sense, an only system of asylum is very important, and say it coming of a country in the that the political asylum allowed to fighters by freedom save life and continue in other #european countries.
The Commission no only *atreve to affirm that the goal is far to be reached, but that ascertains besides that grow traffic and consumption of *estupefacientes, it that involves that a fine part of money spent up to now has not resulted to be investment against drug, but to boost diffusion.
Splitting of my experience in charge, now believe that circulation without control of persons in world-wide terms during the next 20 or 30 years, so much #if it bases in economic subjects as in climatic subjects, represents a colossal challenge for order established and democracy.
The limit that #everyone will comprise and will respect is the that in this same moment neither the Commission neither the European Parliament have formulated of precise form and detailed position and proposals for the next institutional negotiation that will initiate to the beginning of the next year.
The Commission, *despechada by have not been able to block the debate, *apresuró to appoint by account work group restricted, to the that in followed described of group of experts, *cuando results that members are not more expert that the majority of persons here present.
members of the #european delegation of the *PvdA have voted in favour of amendment that consolidates *procedimentalmente the resolutions of the European Parliament of 3 December 1998 and of 5 May 1999 related with the statute of deputies to the European Parliament.
Have voted against the resolution of the European Parliament relative to the annual report 1998 of the Central Bank European (#ECB), as it approves said report, that, to time, situates in the perspective of the step to a monetary system European entirely unified.
In #day of the start of negotiations of the *OMC, have to remember that company strategy -included multinationals- has to take into account, in plan of equality with the economic and financial data, the human data so that millions of #european employees #can conserve work places and dignity.
*Michelin has reduced -true is- number of work places in 25.000 in twenty years, but -have to remember it to #some- treats of 25.000 disappearances of places of work owed to the efforts of comparable productivity in #all the industrial sectors and, in particular, in the of car and of tyres: of these 25.000 only 186 have been dismissals.
The European Union considers the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms like a key instrument in the system of international security, instrument that offers the global guidelines to promote the no proliferation of nuclear arms and the nuclear disarmament.
#would Wish that they took advantage of any opportunity to explain and highlight to colleagues of the Senate why #would have to reconsider his vote on the Treaty and how commitment renewed with the no international proliferation and arm control will benefit to the American interests in matter of security, #as well as a greater security and international stability.
The *detractores Americans of treaties like the that today *nos occupies forget the fact, aims, that States Joined already have left to make proofs and that the Treaty helped to freeze the world-wide advance of nuclear arms *cuando States Joined enjoys of an enormous strategic advantage.
The majority of orators have made the *importantísima distinction among States Joined and the Administration of States Joined, on the one hand, and the American Senate and the Republican majority in particular, by #another, as they have signalled Mr. Baron, Mr. *Haarder and Mr. *Elles #among others.
Gentleman President, now has remained perfectly clear that the majority of the colleagues of this Assembly share my *convencimiento that the tragedy of *Chechenia #can have averted #if the European Union had shown a firm attitude with regard to the #russian aggression.
Although it is simpler to understand through agency plots and institutions, a basic purpose of program will be to break barrier and favour culture of the bases of society, since function is not to create an official culture.
On the other hand, the just worry expressed by Mr. #Perry, signatory of said amendment, regarding that Parliament had to control in these years cost and the budget of the Observatory, follows valid from moment in that we leave the five years, is to say, leave to the Observatory the possibility of programming organic and amply the valuable functions that has.
transparency to establish in this way is a previous condition *irrenunciable for the political performance in road of *Europa to society of information, although perhaps #this no *les enjoy too much to #that that want that they open wide open without limitations the doors to some interests of power in the market.
In the future, the Commission foresees to expand activities that makes the Observatory, in particular, in two concrete fields: the application of a statistical structure to treat information in the frame of *Eurostat and the preparation for negotiations of the *GATT 2000.
Nevertheless these difficulties and the *recrudecimiento of the problems registered lately, said idea has carried to Parliament to extend to *Turquía the proposal in the session of the past 25 February and, takes days, to the Commission to take measure in this sense.
Create, simply, that the problems that have posed in occasion will be examined by Budget Commission, in the frame of work group created by president *Wynn, on the group of subvention politics of our institution.
articles 2 and 4 of the Annex of the Regulation collect #some disposals that contradict clearly the Protocol on the privileges and immunities in it that to condition of deputies refers and that, besides, regulate the question of immunity of form that moves away of it stipulated in the corresponding rule of the mentioned protocol.
Decide *impulsivamente and by majority a question of this type attributing to the subject of the *anejos meaning that do not takes into account that these agreements affect to fundamental questions, supposes, in mood, be missing to the fundamental reason, to the purpose to be of norm that are.
1) Wish that it underline the importance of problems no resolved by the Round *Uruguay (and #whose harmful effects today begin to suffer) in the fields of the social costs that *yo mentioned before, but also in the of the environment, of the public health, of feeding, #etcetera.
With #everything, is necessary to remember that, solos against #all, or almost, *nos had denied to approve the Round *Uruguay, so much in the #french National Assembly as in the European Parliament, precisely by reason: thought that it was very dangerous to accept important reductions of tariffs *aduaneros, without having resolved before the essential collateral problems.
Support, in this sense, and have said it on purpose ten deputies pertaining to the subgroup Free Alliance European of the Green Group\/European Free Alliance, the resolution presented by the Popular Party European, by the Socialist Party European and by the Group *UEN.
Affects to form of life that populates our coasts, of form that with agriculture populates our inner territory and -why not to say it- affects to a fundamental contribution of feeding of #all the group of the European Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, the #french study confirms that in the case of the *EEB no exist reliable scientific criteria to determine the cause, transmission mood and the incubation period of illness, not even regarding the human variant of the *EEB.
To continuation parts signed a new protocol that establishes the technical and financial conditions in the frame of the *cuales crafts of the Community #can fish in waters of *Angola for the period comprised among 3 May 1999 and on 2 May of the 2000.
This type of agreements -always that they conserve the biological resources, is to say, that do not produce #one *sobrexplotación- also benefits to the countries in the that it carries out activity, so much by the monetary contribution of the European Union as by help that provides, for example, in matter of professional training and of scientific investigation.
opacity that accompanies to the processes of dialogue *macroeconómico, the absence in east, even of the European Parliament, take more intense #ours worry by *encontrarnos, once again, in front of an attempt to revoke the fundamental rights of workers and of *minar it that it #can remain in *Europa of the social model European.
As well, these four actors are an extraordinarily dangerous mix that, on the one hand, treats to delete the true problem for *Europa, is to say, the fault of a true economic politics and, by #another, treats to toughen the system with negotiations little clear, to spite of unemployment and of the market.
Have dialogue among the that direct the monetary politics, is to say, the Central Bank European; the political strengths of *Europa, to those who represents the Council and the Presidency; and the social speakers, that represent to strengths of production and of work.
Still will take long in seeing the light and maybe is better that like this was, but anyway yes agree with Mr. *MacCormick in that the fiscal situation of artists that work in different countries of the Union deserves attention. Am had to confront this problem as long as *me get wise suggestions to the *respecto.
#If it results that in some countries the social norms are more demanding that in #others, #if it results that #some norms allocated to the conservation, defence and the protection of the environment are more demanding and more strict in some countries that in #others, will not be able to prevent that said countries go further of the generally accepted criteria.
Finally, do not accept that it was the EU the that establish prescriptive norms to States members on the key subject of unemployment and consider evil presage the suggestions that have made deputies of the side of the Assembly this morning in the sense that they #would have to reinforce the guidelines or even *hacerlas *vinculantes.
Is necessary, nevertheless, that the guidelines and recommendations to scale #european translate in concrete and quantifiable goals, to the *cuales States members have to tend with his respective national plans. Some concrete goals that establish dip *mensurables to half term, convergent in terms of tax of employment and of reduction of the *gap existent among masculine and feminine employment, even through investments in infrastructures and in services, of promotion of the juvenile employment.
*Señorías, has formulated repeatedly the proposal of a more systematic collaboration among the Commission and the European Parliament to service of a more effective impulse of the strategy for the #european politics.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0042\/1999) on the common position approved by the Council with seen to the adoption of a directive of the Council on fulfillment of the labour schedule of sea persons on board of fuselages that use community ports (8639\/1\/1999 - *C5-0035\/1999 - 1998\/0321(*COD)) (Commission of Employment and Social Subjects) (Speaker: Mr. *Hughes)
Lady Speaker, on the presentation of the report of the Court of Accounts, is true that, in this moment, the report of the Court of Accounts -that before happened almost unobserved- has converted in an important news and of actuality of face to the press.
By reason, neither #would have to hesitate now in the last stone of legislation and choose here road of the Conciliation Committee, since, obviously, the Council do not has brave to give the last jump and has shown very *remiso in a pair of points.
Want to signal that the European Commission and the European Parliament have boarded wide queries about #all these subjects with the #european industry of car, that, voluntarily, accepted a calendar for *recortar dioxide broadcasts of carbon in the new cars a 25% for the year 2008.
#If our decisions mean that the simplest solution is the most used ,is to say, develop technician to clean gases of combustion using catalysts that require great quantities of solution of *amoniaco, then the alone distribution of this solution of *amoniaco to #all the *gasolineras of *Europa will take that it lose a fine part of the environmental benefit.
program *Daphne has like goal support and recognise work made by the no governmental organisations, #as well as organisations -included the public authorities that occupy of violence-, and procure that they collaborate among *ellas, exchange of fine practices -included projects pilot to scale community on prevention of violence-, and support and protection of boys, teenage and women.
has to measure the real impact of the distinct types of violence on the victims to determine the timely answers, evaluate the types and efficiency of measures and practical to warn and detect violence, support to the victims and warn a future exhibition to #the same.
The European Parliament and, in particular, Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities have exerted paper of paramount importance when including firmly in the #european agenda the question of violence against women and boys.
This week the world celebrates the *décimo anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of Boy, that is the treaty on human rights more ratified in the world and the legal statement wider of the rights of boys all over the world.
Have to *propiciar a collective reflection on conditions of life of boys in #all the #european countries, especially in the urban zones, and engage collaboration and help bottoms to families needed, especially the *monoparentales or with handicapped parents.
By reason, the European Parliament has to send an influential message to #all the institutions of the European Union, to the international organisms and to the no governmental organisations that say that we have to take disappear this current shame.
Finally, will say that *cuando take the *segunda reading, #if *nos take seriously the creation of employment, #if *nos take seriously the need to keep competitiveness of industries, #if we are serious regarding supporting to companies, #some of *nosotros perhaps think that we have gone too much far and that has got moment to put limit.
To end have achieved that it adopted amendment that foresees the obligation of the Commission to present in the year 2003 an exhaustive report to show how is it that has improved thanks to work of investigation Commission.
do not believe, without embargo, that was moment neither place to put dates of caducity to cheque #british and to discounts conceded to determined countries in finance of said cheque, more still *cuando decision proposals have not been approved still in the different national Parliaments.
*Me cheers that Parliament have occupied again so acutely of the question of finance structure and *me cheer personally even more of have been able to ascertain points common among the positions that have exposed today in the debate and my basic position.
The costs of agriculture constitute a very delicate question in breast of the EU, since the agricultural politics is the only sector in the that the EU *incide in the direct income of citizens.
#If we matter more of the 50% of the total consumption of energy of the European Union, then owe *preguntarnos how #can guarantee supply security in front of the climatic modifications that no only *nos #can and *nos go to reach in front of CO2 broadcasts that take place all over the world #if we do not react, but especially also #if they produce modifications in the political climate.
Goal of the European Union is to create a space of freedom, security and of the right in the that it guarantee the free circulation of persons and in the that citizens of the Union #can demand rights with guarantees that have in front of the Courts of his own country.
The entrance in vigour of this regulation goes to close lagoon in the field of the international private right and represents an important step to take of the Union a space of freedom, security and of the right.
Gentleman President, treating of the report of Mrs. *Gebhardt, do not put in doubt the fine intentions of speakers and share worry for strengthening the juridical security of persons in the frame of matrimonial subjects so delicate like painful for the interested.
In relation with development of execution procedures -it that calls the *exequátur of the foreign trials- development is beyond all doubt useful in civil matter, as in matter of divorce or of parental right, as they are useful looks of the judicial mutual help, but is precise to take care of not going too much far by this path.
#If #one about realistic mood to things, it is necessary to concede of course to the countries time term for adaptation to the corresponding standards of security and not proceeding according to method of or *desconectar immediately or leave in operation to reactors until the end of life useful.
What before recognise neighbours that the nuclear security is our common worry, so much before will be possible to keep negotiations with our neighbouring countries of a constructive and open mood and conclude also negotiations on enlargement.
To the listen it, when listening to mates along the debate, remembered the recent electoral campaign and the answers that had to give, in moment, to constituents on the needs of founding and to finish the #european construction.
In this political solution, no only has to consider how is it that *nosotros wish -are perfectly that this subject has an enormous importance in #some States members and, #such as it has shown the debate, at present especially for *Austria-, but that in a political solution it is necessary to see of course also that this subject has purchased meanwhile in the countries candidates almost a theological importance.
(IN) In relation with the scientific information and evaluation and other, treats of a question that am no only by events of the last weeks, *cuando the agency of alimentary security of the Been member that it treats adopted a different opinion of the of the Managerial Committee Scientist.

*Ella *me remembered that, in a preparatory conference that celebrated in *Viena in 1998, the Commission of Woman of Nations Joined had listened especially to Europeans that manifested pain, suffering, abuses, the *penalidades suffered during the dramatic nationalist confrontations in the territory of the ancient *Yugoslavia.
#would Want equally express my congratulation with reason of the conference that celebrated in *Bruselas the past month of October under the consigns «citizens of the third age in the century *XXI: life by in front». to personal title, believe that it treats of #one of the most fruitful conferences to the that have assisted since I am deputy to the European Parliament.
chamber of the #european population is affected in these moments, and *nosotros pretend to put self-esteem of this social group in attention centre so that they #can fulfil task and his social role of mood in that *nosotros now *nos imagine it.
Has foreseen the Commission boost the use of biofuel and *biolubricante now that the Summit of *Berlín has taken upsetting in the need to deploy an agricultural politics more forceful in the field of the no alimentary applications?
Admit that products #can go out *algo more expensive that the conventional products, but the ecological benefits are so great that the European Commission really #would have to elaborate active proposals in this sense so that products mentioned #can open path in the #european markets.
And, second, that companies that have value to follow living and producing in #Venecia with costs much higher that the other, have some fiscal helps, and that the Commission withdraw sanctions that has begun to instruct because the #italian Government has conceded helps.
Believe that no *nos corresponds to *nosotros go in in the debate of experts about the specific options that they #can solve the problem of the *acqua high, but consider that it is necessary to think in #Venecia as in a zone with specific problems, in that help and care, directed to keep a viable economic context, are necessary.
Is to the light of #this that it wanted to ask an explanation, a fine explanation -have said a very fine explanation- of the Table and of School of *Cuestores on reasons not to allow exhibition that *yo had invited and to the that previously had given permission.
Yes know that the Socialist Group has delivered a very short text with only some questions and maybe the #others texts offer the possibility to modify it a bit but, President, do not understand why suddenly postpones to Tuesday *algo that we #would have to have taken already the past week.
To #mine request has drafted a report in Employment Commission and Social Subjects on productivity taxes and the green taxes and of *él gives off that, #if it introduces tax type to #european level, #can have great effects for employment.
Without coordination of the economic politics more general, the monetary politics will not have neither efficiency neither vigour that want that have, of luck that coin of the European Union exert his true paper.
In the report of the Court of Accounts there #be, certainly, a series of negative comments about the execution of the budget -on #some will talk immediately- but #would be lightness #if they attributed only to the Commission deficiencies that have produced.
*Me encourage, in consequence, the wish and hope -certainty, #would say- that with the structural changes already in course in the organisation and operation of the Commission, will be easy for the next Parliament -that will have support of the Commission and will not have to confront to it that *nos have confronted *nosotros the last three years- receive explanations and find solutions.
The Commission keeps the position that to procedure deficiencies criticised by the Court of Accounts #can put *coto establishing a minimum grade of competition, especially, in the procedures of the public contests and in adjudication procedures.
The Commission has understood that the to adopt clear decisions and strictly political that tie hands of the new Commission in moment in that the Commission has resigned is a question that has to consider attending to the particular circumstances of each case.
Finally, wanted to underline that, since the institutional calendar and the political circumstances take to coincide the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with the renewal of Parliament and of the Commission, will have to be institutions renewed the that take dialogue on this matter with the Council.

do not have to fear by a negative budgetary reflection because fix in the reduction of VAT in crop of the ornamental plants. sales went up so much in my country that arks of state collected 340 millions more.
Mrs. *Peijs *me has asked flexibility in the sense to achieve the result it more quickly possible and, therefore, interpret the paradoxical appeal and precisely in the sense of not admitting the amendments that #would not take thing that *ralentizar the process.
Have to remember that, for example, even the exceptions based in article 27, that in bottom are disposals of application and no a new legislation, require unanimity; have to remember the great difficulties that are regarding the Committee of VAT that, by nature, is merely *aplicativo, although States members resist to that it happen norm by qualified majority.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman candidate President of the European Commission, *Señorías, the resignation of the salient Commission has left very clear first of all that it is necessary a balance of powers more democratic among Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
#would Have appreciated that this availability had been clearer takes months, *cuando, for example, tackled the Statute of deputies to the European Parliament or the technical and statutory terms in the *cuales had to vote to President of the Commission.
#would Wish to signal that the small countries neither have privilege regarding this question, by it that #would have to demand that States members smaller, that have member of the Commission, recognised that women also have experience and are qualified, #as well as that it is possible to find candidates to occupy square in the Commission.
Finally, want to require that the improvement of production and of commercialisation of honey, that went object of my report on the regulation *ad *hoc and in the frame of the *cual have obtained 15 millions of euros to the year, although *yo had requested 65, raisin by a high level of requirements in matter of quality, of control and of labeling of honey.

#This is the first time that a regional alliance of nations takes part in defence of the human rights, to reestablish some stable conditions in a zone of *Europa that is from eight years ago a reaction in chain of attempts of this type and always by reasons.
The world-wide organisation to the that before has taken reference has *fracasado, without embargo, completely, since it has not known *insuflar life to Letter and to the International Right, but that in big part have remained reduced to dead letter, and neither has prevented conflicts, that is the end for the that in fact it was created.
And to finish, the last question, in the situation in that now *nos find, gentleman President, #can *decirnos #if the Council is conscious of the urgent need to develop, in the frame of the Alliance, of course, analysis capacity and defence capacity that are ideal for *Europa?
It that *le #can say is that the Commission, at least from the point of humanitarian sight, #as well as #all the humanitarian agencies, have not been informed by States members, although in addition to seat in the Atlantic Council take it in the European Union.
since President of the Council has initiated today the debate asking where find the political solutions, *yo wanted to add a complementary question: how has taken in the last years of prevention of the crisis, of the preventive measures?
As well, reservation is a typical instrument pure and hard of international Right public, and the juridical instrument chosen by the Council to dip of *rondón #that *descomunitarización, differentiation, discrimination among the #european members of parliament is, precisely, reservation.
#If we accepted project of the Council and the amendment of the liberal, instead of the text elaborated in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens under the direction of Mr. *Rothley, *nos #would be *desautorizando again in relation with a decisive subject and that *nos affects directly.

Now that the European Parliament aspires to debug the European Union and exert with responsibility function like budgetary authority, *me results personally problematic the fact that 490 civil servants of the European Parliament go to benefit of promotion in the year 2000.
But, gentleman *Jarzembowsky, results cynical that *usted, that has tried #everything to avert that it got to regulation and that has tried #everything to avert that they include external costs for example in toll taxes or in the *gravámenes for the use of determined infrastructures, now take as #if this agreement went too much low and did not adapt to the situation of the environment.
For example, commitment credits do not contain an explicit disposal to include the external costs in the *gravámenes existent, although it allows, and in #some cases demands, differentiation of the *gravámenes existent with the purpose to reflect the environmental look and effects.
Finally, have to applaud allusion that takes to credit cards, because truly there #be had in *ellas an enormous abuse, and believe that the amendment to the *respecto, that is the 25, has to carry with rigour, since without signature, simply with retaining a number of card, give abuses that #all know and, therefore, in point it is necessary to be very rigorous.
But, besides, it is necessary to remember here that execution norms *hipotecaria subject to competition of the courts of place in that it situates the well, and have to remember to the *respecto article 16.1 of the Agreement of *Bruselas of 1968 that, obviously, the community Right has to respect, and has to respect, in definite, gentleman *Whitehead, for the good end of the interests of consumers.
Therefore, will insist in that the #european building is construction juridical, a construction in Right, and or have lawyers, in general with persons of the Right, like belt of transmission among the rules and the social reality or badly will go the #european construction.
So that the amendment 61, that introduces a right to renounce to the right to obtain information before the celebration of agreement means that the Commission has to refuse article 11, had account that establishes that consumers #can not renounce to the rights that *les confers the directive.
Finally, expect that Parliament contribute with collaboration to guarantee a fast approval of the current proposal that ensure continuity among program of community action at present in course and program proposed that will go in in vigour on 1 January of the year 2000.
Have to admit that in the *segunda reading of the Managerial frame agreed with the Council in that the Directive mark was not the correct frame for disposals of the specific directive relative to level of *pesticidas in the *potitos, although of course also was totally in accordance with Mrs. *Breyer in the need that the *potitos were free of *pesticidas.
Am -and my Group also- very satisfied with the result of the conciliation procedure, since in the course of the conciliation procedure accepted this principle, of course no like integral part of the conciliation procedure, but politically like part of negotiations.
Now only #can expect that producers of the EU effect a fast change in food production for babies and small boys, because thing is clear: baby feeding and small boys has to be free of any poisonous substance.
Now, in the frame of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, is possible the simple rejection by part of Parliament *cuando *nos *oponemos to a text in place of rejection in two simpler -stages, easier and plants to Parliament in a stronger position.

Believe that, #if we achieve to give priority to the idea of a constitutional pact and of citizenship, has to mean before that swims a political will reinforced of political integration, of *superación of nationalism -and *permítanme remember it here in moment in that it goes back to *prender war in the *Balcanes-, path has to be the of integration, because, as it said here *Mitterrand, «nationalism is war».

ignorance is not virtue, although sometimes it #can be a doubtful debatable blessing, but ignorance based in secret #can not be accepted in a mature political system, that is the that we have to build in the *Europa of persons and of citizens.
On these bases, entrust likewise in that, when treating to create a common space of freedom, security and justice, inspire in the principles of solidarity and of inclusion and do not think in making a *Europa community, peaceful and rich in interior and impenetrable for the that *presionan from outside, pushed by the *hambre, war and the social needs.

Gentleman President, want *sumarme to convictions and to the words already *proferidas by the colleagues, but want to affirm here that death in *Timor Oriental did not get to this territory after the referendum: before *él, more of #two hundred one thousand *timorenses lost life in front of passivity of the international community, that observed to village of *Timor Oriental as #if it was village *prescindible.

Estimate that it treats of a true problem of face to treat to create a situation inside the *cual #can fulfil the possibility to introduce in the context of the Mediterranean a more complete assessment and that first of all offer a big perspective in this sense.
In it that concerns to rapidity, efficiency and transparency of action of said Agency is important to treat to consider appointment a fine occasion no only to be able to reconstruct *prioritaria and quickly in the existent situation in *Kosovo, but to try create condition so that the problem of the migratory flows in the Mediterranean watch with special attention.

Like this as, no only #Grecia but also other seismic countries, have to take #all measures of *blindaje *antisísmico necessary so that they do not repeat tragedies like #this; because it is a fact that, although of the earthquakes #can not take responsible to the governments and persons, concerning damages that #this *ocasionan, responsibility is *tremenda, and like this have shown it the earthquakes in #Grecia and in *Turquía.
#Can imagine that the conjoint mission of evaluation, similar to the that finishes to request , that at present carry out in the zones of the disaster THROW, representation of the Commission in *Ankara, Nations Joined and the World-wide Bank will present a more exact picture of the needs.

modality of the final control constitutes, in fact, an invitation to the criminal behaviours, since they take advantage of adulteration possibilities, which has conducted -fits to suppose- to the systematic addition of toxic substances in the field of production of *piensos.
damage caused by the *sobresalto caused by dioxin is incommensurable, so much regarding the destruction of confidence of consumers as to the economic consequences of having blurred the reputation of sectors industrial fundamental and creators of export.
Lady *Maij-*Weggen, *yo expect that Group contribute to that the decisions of Budget Commission of the that have had news #can be reconsidered and #can modify in Plenary, with the withdrawal of cuts in relation with the proposals of Development Commission that now are on the table.
Believe that the European Commission, the European Parliament and the governments of States members have to intensify measures in matter of campaigns of information on the public health; have to take it by means of Health Departments or by means of voluntary groups that so important paper exert to help to the affected by said illnesses.
And the answer, as they have affirmed Mr. *Wurtz and orators, has been the bureaucratic answer to reduce first of all the relative budgetary costs to investments in the field of AIDS.
The Council has taken a decision on finance, but has taken it without having had available the corresponding resources and this fact is the that has called attention of Budget Commission.
Parliament #can ascertain now that so much the Commission like the Council have taken #his to a large extent our proposals and, therefore, in speaker quality of Industry Commission, wanted to appreciate sincerely collaboration and the spirit of cooperation that the has chaired.
The commission approved with the greater possible consensus, or was, by unanimity, the proposal to restart varied important aspirations of the amendments proposed in the first reading that were not attended by the Council, although we receive with big satisfaction -and *yo also want to manifest it here, gentleman *Langen- the wide coincidence with Parliament.
Even so, go to devote, for period annual, sixty millions of euros for fission in front of fifteen millions for the renewable energies, and #two hundred millions of euros for fusion; *ello *nos gives an idea of the real politics that follows the European Union.
And is undoubtedly through the possibility to have access to network, to be sufficiently flexible in the proposals that take, that allow to give coverage to the distinct instruments that the distinct States members have used and that are not *homogéneos and that they are distinct, as we will be able to guarantee that the renewable energies no only keep but that duplicate, *Señorías, in the next years.

In spite of criticism on attitude of the European Union, support fully the basic goal of the Agreement, to know, the economic development of *Sudáfrica and integration of this country in the world-wide trade.
A "rich country" of #one of the poorest continents #where the social relations are still very uneven, until point that the *PNUD classifies to this country in place 93 by the index of human development.
For *nosotros is indispensable to know #if *Sudáfrica has adopted or no the necessary measures so that a series of essential denominations, among *ellas the of Port and Sherry, do not use already in exports to the European Community and, in term of five years, see suppressed for market to export.
Gentleman *Prodi, *me fear that in this subject *usted and colleagues have not taken into account sight point of the European Parliament and of numerous constituents that think that civil servant, that has given alarm voice, do not deserves reprimand, but all it contrary.
Finally, since I have talked of lessons that have to extract of this natural catastrophe, have to signal also attention that concede - and have said it in breast of school - to the idea, underlined in the European Parliament, to coordinate better means of the different States in matter of civil protection.
*Yo want to highlight especially in this context the Commission introduced the agreements of compulsory purchase among producers and the primary transformers and afterwards established also the requirement of permission for #all transformation companies.
In this hypothesis, is evident that today #can not know, when voting the calendar for the year 2000, #if the agenda of the partial period of sessions of November of the year 2000, for example, will be overloaded and #if it is necessary, in case, add a *minisesión days 29 and 30 November, is to say, inside fourteen months exactly (more of a year).
In May of 1997, the ministers of Justice reached an agreement on a protocol by the that it concedes immunity against the *enjuiciamiento of personnel of *Europol by any "word said or written or actions made in the exercise of his official functions" and by data treatment no authorised or wrong.
Although I receive with satisfaction the recent commitment of *Monsanto of not commercialising termination "technology of seed" , this subject is too much serious to leave it in hands of the that are directly involved and that #would have acted of mood of have not existed surveillance of consumer.
utility of globalisation has to benefit proportionally by the same to the regions and nations of the world, #if well the interests of the European Union, of the remaining #european States, of the #EE.UU, of the States industrialised and of the emergent countries and in roads of development have to be carried to a better balance.
And in measure, the *OMC #can not limit to the commercial questions; has to also tackle fundamental questions, like the quality and *inocuidad of foods, the animal welfare, the environmental protection and respect of consumers and sensitivity.
Gentleman President, yesterday have celebrated in this same hemicycle a debate on the reinforcement of the alimentary security in *Europa, whereas in breast of the Union have developed conflicts on the principle of caution, and simultaneously the North American look for reprisals *injustificadas.
The EU has converted in an important actor of the world-wide economy by means of integration of the #european economy, and will be only through negotiation round that contemplate different sectors as we will be able to guarantee stability of the economic growth.
Have to know, with #all -said was among *nosotros-, that, in group, the balance of the application of the mechanisms that have created after *Marrakech is totally correct from sight point of the Union, treating of relation among the number of cases that have subjected and the won or #stray cases.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the next world-wide conference on the climatic changes of 25 October to 5 November 1999 in *Bonn: application of the Agreement of *Kioto.
growth of forests like factor *eliminador of carbon dioxide follows and has to follow being debated of open form, and in this debate will be able to include also the increase of the multipurpose of forests to contribute to the protection of the half and brake the climatic changes.
Like this as, the Council supports #all the initiatives directed to struggle against poverty that help to facilitate information, that make possible information exchange and of experiences, that promote the adoption of new methods for the fight against the social marginalisation and that look for forms to evaluate experiences had.
Now that the fight develops in breast of the UN it is necessary to have care with *contrapropuestas *traicioneras, that although perhaps have an innocent appearance, come from distinct spots to weaken a taking of forceful position by part of the General Assembly of the UN.
Along these 19 years, *nos have found with numerous hits of effect to hour to discover the truth that, as it seems, do not achieves to open path by complicity of the one who is interested in that it do not know despising the legitimate rights of families of the victims and mortifying the fundamental principles of democracies.
To be truth, the facts show that *Nietzche had reason *cuando said that madness is *algo rare in person, but, instead, is common in the parties, the groups and the organisations, and precisely therefore we need an individual and independent surveillance of the daily work in the nuclear plants.
Wanted to insist in that the publication of the Green Book on sustainable energy in *Irlanda has to be considered like a positive contribution to the debate on form to occupy of the threat that poses the climatic change, inside the energetic sector.
Lady Speaker, believe that in this concrete stage proceeds to say that they have been the conservative British, the *PPE, those who have asked that point inscribed in the agenda of Friday simply because, as it has said Mr. *Watson, the Commission will not be able to formulate statement until Friday in the morning.
treats of personnel subjected to the statute of civil servants and agents of the Communities, #as well as, quote, "members, leaders or members of personnel of the institutions, of organs and of organisms of Communities no subjected to the statute" .
do not pretend that it except to the elect members of control or that are not object of investigation referent to activities, including the of #european deputy in the exercise of mandate, but fear that this agreement give place to suspicions and to assimilation airily, without perspective, as it has occurred during the last months of 1999.
treats of *algo so *grato for #all that in the European Union #would have to *esforzarnos for creating a suitable frame for trade form: A suitable frame for the mutual confidence among citizens of different countries since, after all, #if there #be *algo that do not bear mention in borders, #that *algo is Internet.
Gentleman President, there #be not in the budget base juridical, and believe that #this is a grave lack, because it #can reveal, as it has revealed in the case of #Grecia, but also in other cases, a fault of sensitivity in front of the unpredictable misfortunes that #can suffer #ours *prójimo, in the that we #would have to show generosity.
To Fishing Commission *le concern very especially the budgetary line *B2-901, relative to control operations and of surveillance made by States members, line *B2-903 relative to support to Politics *Pesquera Common, and line *B7-8000, relative to the international agreements of fishing.
Have to give graces besides, in name of Development Commission and Cooperation, to time to the general speaker of the budget, gentleman *Bourlanges, and to Budget Commission, #as well as to president, gentleman *Wynn, by the position that have adopted in this question.
By #this propose that in the next period carry out an analysis of programs, with the relative lines of credit, no longer by periods of four, five or six years, but by periods more reduced: of #one or two years at most, since market logics and of investment in an economy *globalizada no longer answer to the criterion with the *cual has structured the budget.
#If the Council has not found way to fund reconstruction of *Kosovo that through a linear cut of the external actions of the Union, is logical that the European Parliament want to now defend lines.
#If #all parts interested respect the fundamental distribution of competitions and act in consequence, the achievement of the goals of #all the areas of performance will be the natural result of decisions of individual performance.
Finally, the debate on a "combination of politics balanced and adapted" did not have to use to divert attention of the structural reforms that so urgently need to face up to the grave structural problem of unemployment in the zone of the euro.
The irrational exuberance that characterises to #some bags, the excessive indebtedness of families #american and of some economic sectors in the important countries take that it weigh a true threat on the world-wide economic stability.
workers concern because the Central Bank European considers a danger, for the famous monetary stability, rhythm of greater growth that the 2,5%, *algo that carries to the fight against unemployment to future indeterminable.
Are keeping a debate *algo wander and results interesting to read the words of gentleman speaker in reason exhibition, is to say, that the European Parliament " ... is responsible so much to receive and debate the annual report of activities of #ECB as to control #ECB" .
Wanted to signal that Realm Joined and the Conservative Party British -to the that belong- never have been hostile to the euro like coin for States members that really wish to join , since #all are tied as a result of belonging to the only market, so that a sinking of confidence in the euro #can *afectarnos to #all, are inside or out of the *UEM.
Also is essential, in my opinion, that encourage to the Bank to follow the example of other great central banks, like the Federal Reservation American, and to take of transparency a fundamental look of #all activities.
The historical examples do not are missing to this *respecto and the warning is not *ociosa in the current moments, in the *cuales the economic recovery in *Europa do not finds, neither *muchísimo less, confirmed, and in the that, to the own time, assist to speculations on the imminence of a monetary politics more strict.
Gentleman President, gentleman *Duisenberg, *nosotros deputies, as we have manifested varied times tonight, have a fundamental paper that exert in relation with coin only put that this Assembly is the only place in the that village of *Europa #can exert a democratic influence in mood in that it manages coin only.
The system of the Euro, to the principle, left clear during a short period of time that the provision #would not constitute a problem taking into account that it #can ensure that money guaranteed to the banks or to organisations will not go in in circulation before 1 January of the 2000 - is to say, in general circulation.
The results of the application of politics see reflected in the notorious decrease of complaints by rape of the human rights produced by the public strength, #such as they recognise it organism reports *intergubernamentales and the *ONG that act in this field.
The Commission *congratula of the principle of *equiparación, so wide as it was possible, of the rights and duties of citizens pertinent of third States that reside of durable form in the Union with the recognised to the national citizens of States members of the Union and consider that it has to advance with concrete proposals in this sense.
In *Tampere #can not still adopt the idea of a Public Ministry European, even limited to the protection of the financial interests of the Community. *Me allow to propose that the next debate on the Conference *Intergubernamental was a fine occasion so that it collect idea #ours.
#If these decisions, when going back of the field of the high level to the grey *cotidianeidad of the councils of Interior Ministries and of Justice, go back also routine and do not happens at all in three or four years, *Tampere will happen to history like the summit of the statements *irrealizadas.
*Me propose to consider like political and philosophical foundation of the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice #all the relative questions no only to the fundamental rights of citizens of States members of the Union, but also to the of citizens of third States that reside legal and *duraderamente in the territory of the Union.
The past week have kept a debate with #Jean-*Luc *Dehaene -gentleman Commissioner #Michel *Barnier was present- and want to *decirle, gentleman Commissioner, that have a full confidence in that *usted will make contribution to guide the European Union to a positive future and will have #all support in this task.
#This *CIG, without embargo, no will treat so much on expanding the field of responsibility or of competition of the European Union; will treat on the structural reform, the institutional reform, reform that give greater opening to the Union, that the take more efficient, more democratic and more transparent.
Is the question of coding and simplification of the Treaties, a subject that Parliament was the first in putting of relief in the preliminary stage of negotiations of *Amsterdam; a task initiated by *Amsterdam, but that is far to be completed and that it is #another of the arguments in the that takes upsetting the report *Dehaene.
(Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98\/3 relative to the elimination of maritime facilities in disuse (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0015\/1999 - 1999\/0097(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of Consumer)
Receive with enormous satisfaction this intelligent step to cut across #one of the key problems that brake the potential of the electronic trade in *Europa, to know, difficulty to verify identity of users and consumers.
Support the proposal of Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects in the that asks that they facilitate to the *PE records succinct of the meetings of the Council of Governors, in the that present of explicit form the arguments "in favour" or "against" of the decisions adopted and reasons that motivate said decisions.
The European Union believes that the Treaty of total prohibition of nuclear proofs is an important step in the path to the no proliferation of nuclear arms and to the nuclear disarmament, and entrance in vigour results beneficial for #all states.
As a result of the nuclear proofs made by Indian and *Pakistán, the Commission has taken part in the international operative units for the development of measures of confidence and of guarantees and so that these countries undertake constructive negotiations on the no proliferation and arm control in the zone.
But anyway, is important that have a clear expression and *comprometedora of the political will of the international factors and of the that they #can guarantee the world-wide peace and stability that the no expansion of the nuclear arsenals is elevated and constitutes a no negotiable priority.
*Permítanme add some words on finance of the military campaign that, in my opinion - an opinion that do not seems to share Prime minister Russian - believes that it has been able to *repercutir on recovery of the #russian economy during these last months.
#If now, with the unanimous support of the commission contribute other 13 amendments, #this refer in first line to credit endowment, to the term of application and to the requirement directed to States members so that they suppress obstacles in access to program.
Precisely *nosotros the radicals perhaps were the first in creating of autonomous form audience centre in the audiovisual sector attendant of follow-up and control of the presences, for example, politics in the distinct spaces, the distinct newscasts and the media.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading(To5-0038\/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [<lpar>$^13175<num>$/^1<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0022<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1998<num>$/^0197<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> with seen to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes program of community action "Youth" (Speaker: Mrs. *Gröner)
Is especially *inquietante the fact that, simultaneously to the reduction of support costs to the markets of agricultural products, assist, in the frame of the called second *pilar of the *OMC, to the systematic increase of costs devoted to ruin to the small and average agriculturalists.
It same fits to say of the social costs, extraordinarily limited, and oriented no to reduce unemployment and to improve quality of life of workers, but to facilitate measures for the destruction of the frame of labour relations.
But wish underline that, without embargo, are not #naïve: the fact that Parliament wish to substitute the terms "cultural cooperation" by the cultural "political terms" reveals the temptation *uniformizadora of a supposed cultural politics #european, that #would substitute politics of States members.
do not take fault already neither pretexts in this jungle in the that *impera the law of the most violent competition and of immunity of the big capital; of here that *MICHELIN announce to time an increase of the benefits of the 17% and 7.500 new dismissals, that add to the 15.000 of the immediately previous years.
Equally, is necessary that adopt the necessary measures to increase the rights and intervention conditions of the committees of #european company established in the Directive 94\/95, in particular regarding the right to the suspension of licences.
In effect, as it has been signalled aptly by Mr. *Hatzidakis, this Directive foresees disposals transitory, valid until 1 January of the year in course, with the end to allow the ending of works of the European Committee of Normalisation.
The widest possible, that has to include also cooperation *extractiva, as #if *Europa is the main market of export of fish #moroccan, circumscribe cooperation to commercialisation and transformation #would not be it desirable, since the market controls from consumption centres more that from production centres.
Gentleman President, the innumerable pressures that so much the Council and this Assembly like the sector *pesquero had to exert on the Commission have given like fruit that finally, grieve month before finalising fishing Agreement with *Marruecos, have obtained negotiation mandate.
Gentleman Commissioner *Fischler, three months ago that am here and already have seen it prejudice the interests of *Portugal three times: with cows crazy, subject in the that decision results inconceivable; in the *ganadería swine, in the that will of persecution is unacceptable; and now in fishing, in the that inaction of his Commission neither has pardon.
Nobody pretends to put in cloth of trial effective instruments of cooperation with *Marruecos through negotiations that reinforce, inside it possible, the interests so much of the community operators as of the Moroccans underlining this sense of solidarity that, on the other hand, also in the distinct sectors of the *exquisitamente economic, has shown daily especially among the countries of the south of *Europa, in the #mediterranean zone.
On the other hand, the #european fleet so attentive to exert fishing fulfilling the concrete norms of environmental compatibility - biological stops, fields of fishing, prohibition of fishing with *jábega and with networks of drag, #etcetera - needs socioeconomic measures of compensation after an agreement that limits even more, #if it fits, activity, included transformation industry.
do not know #if they are some, but *me have said that in the #french markets sells meat joined still to chips of medullary and cerebral tissue: the corresponding organism #can occupy to control the too much low norms of agricultural hygiene in *Francia; supermarkets #french do not demand the presentation of the reports on *pesticidas.
Gentleman President, comprise to our #british friends, as I comprise to our #portuguese friends, that also see affected, as I comprised to our #belgian friends in the subject of dioxin and as I comprise still better to the French in the subject of debugger slimes.
But neither is necessary to lose of sight that catastrophe of illness of cows crazy that has affected to mates #british #would have been able to affect to #any one of countries, since #all practise politics agricultural *productivista contrary to nature, increasingly subjected to the *librecambismo world-wide.
will Adopt measured against *Francia after the meeting of the Commission on 10 November, #if, to heights, after having had varied days to digest the unanimous decision, the #french Government has not adopted measures to raise prohibition?
Is a special consultative group that takes contribution to committee legally established, established to exert function to advise to the Commission in relation with these subjects, is to say, to the Managerial Committee Scientist.
Remains clear in advance that the end of dialogue in two times is not the to understand on common orientations or commitments *apremiantes; like this, as, dialogue will not conclude with coordination agreement #ex in front of of the different fiscal politics, budgetary, monetary or even contractual.
#If the community interests do not situate in the *primer flat, the Union will not be able to carry advance the necessary politics to complete ordination of the #european market in the sense of a social economy of market environmentally sustainable.
It that is in game is not a question of confidence or of confidentiality -that members of parliament and members of parliament also know to respect-, but that it that in reality *dirime is how go to configure our future in the century *XXI and in this context #can not *escamotear information, analysis, prognosis, but that all has to #make of way really affordable.
#Can restructuring in the labour market, restructuring and reforms that have to take in product markets and of services, in accordance with the decisions of *Cardiff, #can #all these reforms, create conditions so that the monetary politics move in another frame?
But believe that we have to see the positive side politically. That it that concerns so much to villages of *Europa -because #all deputies represent to villages of *Europa, by *ellos have taken use of the word in this hemicycle- by this subject *candente and interesting that is employment and unemployment, comes to the centre of dialogue *macroeconómico.
The fact of not being physically seated in the table of dialogue do not wants to say that no have a possibility of presence of Parliament, a possibility to transmit ideas.
The formulation of the common position #would have allowed simply to the *empleadores abandon the attempts to reach negotiation on the annual computation of the labour day and then States members #can have allowed said annual computation.
In any case, gentleman President, *nosotros support the just claims of workers of the sea, are to side and, in spite of #everything it positive that have these directives, #can not vote approval because they are in a direction that, still with his possible improvements, goes to perpetuate the current inadmissible situation.
From the principle have to underline that today we are a modification of directive relative to bunch of workers that had been excluded of the directive on ordination of work time, that carries debating six years.
Although we do not have news of cases of persecution or imprisonment of scientists by his scientific work, *yo wanted to remember that a series of scientists have been pursued or imprisoned in the last years owing to his political ideas and, to opinion, #would have to take advantage of also occasion to express clearly that persons owe *recobrar freedom.
*Me seems that all it that have witnessed during these last months shows it contrary: the multiplication of the arrests of #dissident, persecution of the supposed sect *Fa-*Lung-*Dung, etc. Obviously, #can conceive a strategic relation with a no democratic country, with a dictatorial country.
The question that imposes is #if with the effective execution of this agreement, the #european interests will correspond of sufficient form with the of *Moscú Concedes the #russian Government, for example, to be concrete, importance that *nosotros to the situations of ecological emergency?
Have here data that *me encourages and that it #would be necessary to project to scale of the European Union.

The brochure of public information of the European Parliament about request right declares that the requests reveal often in a Been practical member that they are contrary to the letter or to the spirit of the community legislation.
Like result of the requests, the European Parliament has had positive effects in the daily life of citizens and has been able to act to find a solution of the cases that include questions of competition of the Community.
Is important that this commission #can continue work, but expect that the Commission was had to offer commitments about processing agile of the requests, to the equal that has taken with article 169 of the Treaty *CE, around claims.
In this sense, wanted to express my gratitude to Parliament by support that in moment has loaned to the Commission in the launching of this big operation of information that is «Citizen of *Europa» (*Citizens *First) that has allowed, for the first time, to citizens be very informed on rights.

Gentleman President, the political task is clear: the Commission has to present to the Council *ECOFIN an action plan on the financial services, and the aforementioned Council has to subject this plan to the approval of the European Council of Colony.

And from here send a message of solidarity to *Xanana *Gusmãor, man that in 1992 was condemned to twenty years of prison and is at present in domiciliary prison, but loomed to go back to prison, to the total prison, only because it took a call in *pro of self-defence of village *timorense.

The amendments of Mrs. *Bennasar, that have received support of Right Commission of Woman, enhance more the participation of the no governmental organisations in the execution of program *DAPHNE.
But, especially, create *yo, the right to life, the right to the dignity, the right to freedom and integrity of each #one. Supposes a clear reference to the human rights by it that program, perhaps, #can be *algo wider and content *originario, the that it had before, #can recover .
The main goal of program *quinquenal *DAPHNE proposed is to support and boost to the no governmental organisations and to the voluntary organisations so that *mancomunen efforts and protect to boys, to youngsters and to women against type of violence.
discrimination follows being very high in #all the fields, and believe that #all persons do not want to be treated like objects of the public assistance, but that demand with reason to society and to the political right to life without discriminations in a safe social surroundings.
Finally, *me seems regrettable, instead, silence of the report regarding the demographic looks -although *les speakers talk of *ello in a *primer moment, from the beginning of report- because anyway at all will be possible -although it was not more that in the financial plane- #if it do not corrects the demographic pyramid of *Europa, that is *reveladora of a true tragedy.
But also treats, since *nos find in a world-wide market, to impose in the next negotiations of the *OCM that will take place in *Seattle the 30 of November, that treats really to disassemble the rigidities of the market and that the European Union #can act here exactly with right equality that in other great sectors.
In the first place, treats of competitiveness of the #european industry of starch; treats of the agreements of *Berlín on seeds *oleaginosas and on plants *albuminosas that, as #all know, are entirely insufficient and no suffice to diminish deficit that there #be in these markets, no *pudiéndonos, therefore, serve of any big help in the current form.
Have listened with satisfaction that gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, in mood, recognises to the Been member the possibility to say the last word regarding politics, but fear sanction that the General Direction *IV, responsible of competition, reservation usually to the state helps.
In effect, *usted has taken the decision to declare inadmissible censorship motion presented by 66 deputies pertaining to #all the political groups. Of form *usted has questioned an inherent right to deputy.
Lady Speaker, #if well an absolute hit of the euro #would improve competitiveness of the European Union, #would wish to call attention on the fact that the structural unemployment represents to time a threat for this same competitiveness.
Always *me has upset a lot hear these great statements *vanagloriándose of the reduction of the public helps to companies, without wanting to accept that, in the meantime, the majority of companies, of the great companies privatised, no longer invest in basic investigation neither in *I+*D, taking that our technological level retreat.
At present have thirteen socialist governments. So much voters like the #european villages expect that they put in practice politics no only to service of employment, but also to service of a social model that do not base in precariousness.
To me, in any case, no *me #would enjoy to finish -since it is a conjoint debate- without saying that, regarding the management of 1996, my delegation -my delegation and *yo same- fix already our position, and that, in these moments in that the Commission has resigned, believe that no thus they #would have to forget commitments of Mr. *Santer, that #would have to be assumed by the new President *Prodi.
In the resolution proposal that tomorrow will have *ustedes that vote, *Señorías, attaches work document that enumerates points that need explanation by part of the Commission, so that the resultant Parliament of the elections #can proceed to the approval of the corresponding management to 1997.
In the case of resources for the *cofinanciación the Commission criticises that the realisation of concrete projects hard too much time and that, especially, flow of resources involves with frequency great problems for the no governmental organisations.
Changes, in end, and very important, of politics, of content, of ambition, of inspiration, of underlying political principles in those matters that happen of the *tercer to the *primer *pilar in the field of justice and of interior subjects and the big change that supposes integration of the social Protocol in the same Treaty.
In this sense, gentleman President, Parliament do not goes to admit that institution *le impose interpretation on questions of procedure, questions that have to be seen -and *eso says it very well the report of the Commission- on the base that act adopted will be it with arrangement to the Treaty of *Amsterdam and that #that is the procedure that has to respect .
The report of Mrs. Palace proposes a procedure that confirms the that it already chose the European Parliament after *Maastricht and that supposes confirmation, by part of Parliament, of the legislative procedures already initiated and #whose juridical foundation or procedure have seen modified in virtue of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
And in the case of the two agreements on the transmission of acts and on the recognition of decisions in matrimonial matter and of parental responsibility -proposed that the Commission will approve morning on the base of the Treaty- will transmit immediately to the Council and to Parliament.
The European Union and States Joined, *Canadá, New *Zelanda, *Australia, have each #one vote in the *OMC, but *cientos of countries in roads of development that expect in the *OMC with hope that they also take in account interests do not have to be separated by the continuous *reyertas among the European Union and States Joined, as it treats also of other essential problems.
The nominations that take for office, character or the tonality multinational or no of personnel, the balance among sexes, #all things will purchase a totally disproportionate importance concerning his real importance.
Regarding intervention about the need that in the great countries have commissioner of the majority party and commissioner of the opposition, *le will say that in *Alemania abuses of this possibility to leave sideways to the Greens, partners of the coalition.
Likewise, in front of war in *Kosovo and first of all it that war reveals of the fragilities of *Europa, wish ardently that the European Union cessation to tackle the future of our continent -the *Europa Central and Oriental, *Rusia, the Mediterranean- with a so careful vision that is too much narrow and finishes for being imprudent.
Exists an institutional and political lack that is to sight of #all, that is the challenge of the next term of office and that it #can be suggestion to take to the new generations: the invitation to no *escatimar efforts in favour of adventure of the culmination of the construction of *Europa.
President of the Central Bank European, Mr. *Duisenberg, do not tires to repeat: «*Me have assigned the task to keep value of the euro and to keep price stability.
Regarding the future, only has referred to a generic and, in this moment, *fumosa international conference on the *Balcanes that evades problems imminent and more urgent, and has evoked the unhappy image of the «*Europa of the sword», term that President #Jacques *Delors abhorred.
During mandate, will have to achieve *usted simultaneously two attainments, to know, the consolidation of the European Union, #whose tasks and dimensions have increased spectacularly in the last years and the last decades, putting order in looks in the that it was necessary, so that, although they do not introduce novelties, the Commission was truly able to work and work.
*Yo believe that the Council, the Commission and Parliament still will have to take *algún institutional effort to avert that #everything *ello escape in practice of the frame *auténticamente community and that Finance Ministers convert by path in the new masters of *Europa.
Regarding the vision of project, *usted has mentioned the need of an external representation and the capacity to take *extensivo to #all *Europa through enlargement, but also to the *Balcanes, for example, peace order that have created in breast.
Finally, although I have appreciated proposal for stability of *Europa of the South and Oriental and an international conference on the *Balcanes, have to say that interventions armed never have carried peace, #if *acaso have detained clashes, but no deleted causes.
From sight point, the excessive *tecnicismo, the excessive *economicismo of the European Council of *Berlín has to be corrected by a community economic politics that take in consideration #all the interests of #all the regions and #all the countries of the European Union.
affirmation is not some, because the bilateral parities among the #european coins fixed on 1 May 1998 -takes precisely a year- and the goal of the rigid fixation of coins among yes prevails from takes varied years.
*Nos surprises to ascertain, in particular, that growth is feebler in the countries that find in the centre of the system euro and that they are taxpayers to the system of the structural Bottoms, and stronger in the most peripheral countries or *beneficiarios of the #european subventions.
Like this will be able to *escucharme, because, in part, agree with my friend *Hervé *Fabre-*Aubrespy *cuando say that *eso already have seen it before in Parliament, but that the application with immediate character, to the following minute, of act that has to still be consecrated by means of Record is *algo entirely new and that, on the other hand, adjusts to the spirit in the that approve the Report *Elles.
#If we had approved the amendment of the Socialist Group, *algo that lamentably have taken 212 colleagues, no #would have denial of the approval of the management and said comments #would not have any juridical value, comments that, repeat, condemned to the Commission.
#would Be paradoxical that Parliament pronounced before the end of mandate on said approval of the management, without having of #all elements, *cuando the second inform of the Committee of Wise persons expects for the autumn and *cuando still do not give conditions for *pronunciarnos with definite character.
war of *Kosovo *nos shows also thing and wanted to go back to remember the words of #François *Mitterand, although it also #can quote to *Helmut *Kohl, the one who said that in *Europa are in game war and peace, and no only the economy, ordinations of the market and intervention prices, by important that also was all #this.
Without security guarantee, refugees, the deported, will not return and the consequence #would be that *Milosevic #would have reached purpose and #would live in #one *Europa that no longer #would be #ours *Europa, the that in fact defends this Assembly, in quality of Parliament of the *Europa of integration.
Also regret the involuntary civil victims of the aerial attacks, but *nos feel morally forced to follow supporting the goal to detain the greater evil, is to say, the racist politics of *Milosevic and those who surround it.
With the *resurgir of nationalism in *Rusia and the social deprivation in increase of the majority of village #russian, have the duty and the interest that *Europa collaborate with *Rusia to intensify democracy, security and prosperity of #all citizens.
Believe that for Parliament and for members of parliament is very important stability and fixation of diet juridical and that, therefore, the Council and Parliament #would have to follow working by road without thinking in clash without commitment solution.
Well, lady Speaker, *yo *me take #this very seriously and expect that the *servcios that review #this objectively, get tomorrow to the conclusion that the report -the report that was and with number that have, *yo on my part *me refer to the report To-0245 that is in the agenda and that has a determined content, do not put in the agenda. To me *me #would result very doubtful that the report was modified by services and that afterwards was put in the agenda.
No doubt in saying that promotion campaigns of the banks and credit agencies are in big way to prices *inflacionarios of house, putting with *ello house out of the scope of youngsters that wish to install his *primer home.
The common position *les gives to States members the possibility to introduce claim obligation in the course of two months, or was that consumer will have to discover and report defect in the course of two months.
#Can say that these procedures always go very fast, but in this case have a model in the that #many of reservations expressed in a principle, #many of fears with regard to the commercial interests, #many of fears of deputies, appeased thanks to way in that said procedures carried out.
And *nos concerns that the normal foods that have special characteristics that the take especially ideal for sportsmen, as they are paste and drinks, happened to remain included inside the specific directive, it that *les #would create big confusion to consumers and #would bump clearly with this simplification of norms that the managerial #would have to promote.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0206\/99) of Mr. *Manzella, in name of the Commission of Institutional Subjects, on the common statement relative to the practical modalities for the new procedure of *codecisión (article 251 of the *TCE)
Think in the principle of fiscal equality among #all deputies, that #can admit transitory exceptions but never definite; in respect to the rights purchased by deputies in matter of pensions in years of work inside and out of Parliament, or in detail questions that is not necessary to enumerate now.
Is necessary to begin already to prepare peace and collaborate with the countries of the region to build a stable system of cooperation among *ellos and boost development that *les allow to adhere what before to a Union that bases in respect to the one who is different and in integration of wealths and cultural and human diversities.
Of course, the lean point of the European Union follow being the external politics and of common security. The Presidency #german has insisted in the need to develop article 17 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Regarding the institutional calendar, are totally of agreement in that it is already an imperative that take the institutional reform, that fix stages that carry to a Conference *Intergubernamental, and #can *decirle to the Council that Parliament has worked during years in establishing a true catalogue of fundamental rights.
Obviously, the European Parliament goes to boost this governmental evolution and, to begin, will take it by means of the resolution that definitely goes to vote in instants and that pretends to give to the Commission paper engine in the institutional reform.
Without embargo, before adopting any decision #would be more careful to expect the second inform of experts of the that the European Parliament, with prudence, has postponed publication until after the #european elections and that certainly *clarificará of interesting form the operation of the institutions.
Is clear that in spite of #all respect by Presidents and Majesties that had to the beginning of the unification of *Europa and of the common contractual drama, today day are the fundamental rights the that they have to constitute the central point. fundamental Rights in the that it declare that citizens and citizens want to build *Europa in freedom, peace and solidarity.
The gradual approach of support prices, accompanied by direct payments, to price level in the world-wide market prepares to companies for the back liberalisation of the world-wide trade that already is.
With regard to the structural politics: the clear *disciplinamiento of the structural politics by means of the internal concentration, is to say, with less objective of help and less community initiatives and by means of concentration of stage of helps, contributes an increase of efficiency.
central Look of #all the structural Bottoms will be thus the creation of places of work with future, it that means growth with intensive generation of employment, strengthening of the competitive and innovative capacity of the regions, sustainable development and promotion of qualification and of equality of opportunities.
Gentleman President, the representatives of the Council approved yesterday the prohibition in #all the European Union of *amianto white, in spite of which exists #one restlessness that they produce unnecessary delays in the signature of this document, in the that Parliament has exerted a positive paper to promote it.
The question of hormones in meat shows that they do not take in account health requirements and protection of consumers and the scarce importance of the «principle of caution» in front of the dominant economic interests.
The three conflicts that have at present among the European Union and States Joined regarding the World-wide Organisation of Trade are relative to the sector of banana, of meat with hormones and of noise of planes in takeoff and in landing.
The social consequences in #some of countries are very important: States members of the European Union lose progressively, after the *OMC, circle of influence regarding the #african continent especially, and *ello in benefit of the continent *sudamericano #whose agricultural resources are exploded or *valorizados in big part by companies dominated by #american capitals.
Is precise that #that that negotiate in name of the *OMC take out shine to arms and *nos reassure: alignment of the community regulations with the rules of the game of the world-wide market never will be able to constitute an agricultural political goal for the European Union.
In effect, how #can be satisfied with commitment that involves an important descent of income of the #european agriculturalists, consecutive to descent of prices partially compensated, expecting his total suppression to satisfy the requirements of the *OMC?
Perhaps in this context of budgetary austerity earn #all dimension the imperative established in the relative Treaty to that #all the community politics -and no only the structural- have to orient from the perspective of the economic and social cohesion.
Also think that it is important -and #this is in line with my report- that the conclusions of *Berlín indicate clearly that in *Europa will have to loan a greater attention to the quality of feeding, security, the protection of the environment, deal respectful with animals, etc., to #european level.
Thus, with the end to avert this threat, vote in the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development amendment that excludes any possibility to expand the viticultural zone to any #another Been clear-cut member or required in this amendment.
Our will *nos carried in December to withdraw the called «strategic amendments» to the budget for the year 1999, and #few days before the European Council of *Berlín, president *Samland sent a letter to the fifteen ministers of Inland revenue *informándoles of the figures that the European Parliament considered absolute minima, the called «*minima *minimorum» .
Before have explained the basic principles of reform of the structural Bottoms, by it that no *les go to bore now with concrete opinions on the different amendments as I have understood in #all interventions that go to follow the procedure #such as it has agreed.
Regret that in the European Council of *Berlín have agreed a significant reduction of money that goes to allocate so much to the structural Bottoms as to Cohesion Bottom, but understand also that application will be positive in the next seven years.
And believe that we have to take into account that these structural Bottoms are practically the last that apply to the fifteen States members, since the perspective of enlargement to States of the centre and of the east of *Europa will modify the politics of regional action for the next years.
Gentleman deputy, in the last time has indicated with clarity to *Turquía that behaviour in the case *Ocalan, the guarantee of a process according to norms of right State, goes to have repercussions on relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Of how mood thinks to take part the Council so that it guarantee the effective protection of the human rights in the *Iraq, in sight, besides, of the debates in breast of the Security Council of Nations Joined on the lifting of the economic sanctions?
And as we believe that we are in favour of the protection of the human rights -and are it, and take well in being it-, #would want *preguntarle #if the innocent population, #if the innocent citizens of *Iraq are not included in category of the population on the that is in vigour defence of the human rights.
Thus, #can the Council confirm or deny data? Go to take measured to ensure that tongue #swedish receive treatment that the great community tongues, and that, from now on, the #swedish representatives #can use tongue and have an interpreter?
Go back to article 203 of the Treaty, as they defend #many of Parliament, in my opinion is not the correct path, will carry to a greater increase of costs of the Union. Especially States members that are #net taxpayers hardly will be able to accept it.
Gentleman President, before dissolving , Parliament has achieved to pronounce on the set up of reform of the structural Bottoms and has reached to affirm positions in the that has run the risk to convert , once again, in confrontation among the #european Institutions.
In any case, the *PAC follows being -of course- #one *PAC thrown off balance, in measure in that, for being based in the concept of historical productivity, the richest countries result clearly much more favoured that the poorest, #if well no *me happens by head take of the poor rich and of the rich poor.
Without damage of the cheques distributed by the diverse countries, the regulation of the structural Bottoms, in particular by means of intermediate evaluations of efficiency reservation and of levels generally inferior of *cofinanciación, goes to take that, in practice, the financial endowments happen to be of «limit of costs», whereas they were «objective of costs».
In this reform of the market of wine have imposed the requirements of the European Parliament, and #can not more that go back to highlight that it #would be desirable that Parliament #can *codecidir in the future, because trade *vacuno dominate it so well like the Council.
#If to #this #can not call by the *pelos'...!; are the eleven less chamber of the night and Parliament is to full performance, even with the presence of the Council, by which *me *congratulo, gentleman President of the Council, since I never have seen before to the Council here in Parliament to the eleven less chamber of the night. appreciate it, is not other that say it.
Previous detailed examination and after keeping numerous informal contacts to #all levels, Parliament #would have to be now in position to issue his opinion about the proposal, so that the Council #can continue work with a crystalline knowledge of the wishes of the Assembly.
Have wanted to treat it in this last session and the Commission simply has followed his usual guideline; #if #this had not been the last session, #would have included in the session of the next month.
#If the Council had wanted to exert *algún paper, #would have to have worked in reaching an agreement *interinstitucional that put end to the anomalous situation signalled in the that the European Parliament, in formal terms, sees involved in insufficient measure in the results of the social dialogue.
Gentleman President, gentleman vice-president of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen deputies, with this debate that initiate on the known and already famous global agreement with *México, closes a cycle of five years in the that Parliament has worked and collaborated actively with the European Commission to renew and deepen relations with the group of the countries of *América Latin and also with *México.
This decision is unlucky because it contributes to accelerate the deterioration, increasingly evident, of the commercial flows, affected, from five years ago, by the dynamism of the *NAFTA, and that, in this period, has reduced quota in the #mexican market of a 11 % to a modest 6 %.
Now well, said #this, and remaining clear that want an agreement with *México, *nosotros #can not *obviar the quantity of questions posed by the different organisations no governmental, that are not #one neither two, and that are not little important: Amnesty International, *Human *Rights *Watch , the League of Rights Human International, *Intermon.
treats rather to look for exit #worthy for person group that during years have put all obstinacy in cooperation of *Schengen and that #can not see prejudiced by integration of *Schengen in the frame of the Union *Europa.
Nevertheless, #can not deny that the definite texts so only got Monday to Parliament, that so only Monday #can argue the final result of negotiations and that, besides, query to Parliament really is pure theatre, since it already is all decided.
Without embargo, also is truth that the proposal of the Commission and the report of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens contribute numerous solutions. To mood to see, both have made an excellent work.
The Group of the Popular Party European and big part of the Commission of Juridical Subjects back the proposal of the Commission, but there are #some amendments that do not deserve support, especially the that refer to responsibility of intermediaries.
In summary, gentleman President, the Popular Party European backs, in a very important measure, the report of the Commission of Juridical Subjects, backs #any amends posed by the Liberal Group and, to exception of the that has mentioned so much Mr. *Hoppenstedt as *yo same, will vote in favour of *ellas in general terms.
treats of a historical moment in the that exists already the possibility to make follow-up of persons to scale world-wide, in the that -for the first time- the civil rights #can not protect with help of borders, as it has come occurring until moment.
Remember moments in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and, among *ellos, the shared with Mrs. *Oddy that, in subjects that began in the previous term of office about the new technologies concerning incompatibility with author rights, always have got to similar positions.
In the world of the communications in line, consumer receives information avalanche and States members #can not protect in the national legislation because the electronic trade *rebasa borders of the countries.
Especially, #would wish to express to my colleagues of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens how much have appreciated work that have made during these five last years, #as well as formulate to the Commission of Juridical Subjects my best *augurios with regard to the next mandate.
*Cuando this morning *me have *enterado by chance that the debate on this report #would not take place until this afternoon to the 18.00 hours and #would proceed to the vote tomorrow in the morning, have got to the conclusion that it is a deeply unfair decision put that it that is in game is the future of persons, of the young persons.
#One of the amendments that go to vote, specifically number 4, that forms part of commitment that have agreed with the Council, involves a modification of section first of article 3 of the Regulation, adding a new initiative, the community initiative *Urban.
#This is not the only reason by the that request that we split of the idea that this vote require a qualified majority. *Me base equally in the political need that a decision of these characteristic review character highly *vinculante for the Council, the Commission and also for Parliament.
In general lines are in favour of reform, without embargo, have to formulate #some reservations in regard to #some looks that still have not deepened it sufficient as, for example, the impact in the regions that, in name of the principle of concentration, run the risk of suffering stagnation in development process.
#This is the reality, while it seems that they discern #some hopes of negotiation after trip to Blunt of #Ibrahim *Rugova and the release of the three #american soldiers, Parliament, in his last hours of work, chooses with this vote on *Kosovo the path *mortificador of propaganda of NATO and *fracasa in his political paper.
Mrs. *Danze-*Serfaty is the wife of Mr. #Abraham *Serfaty, the one who remained imprisoned during 17 years in prison of *Tazmamart in quality of political prisoner, and that it was received with #all the honours in this Assembly, after release, that produced, especially, thanks to interventions and resolutions of Parliament. Without embargo, #can not go in in *Marruecos, *cuando no longer *recae on *él indictment.
The Commission, as #all *ustedes, applauds the signature during the past morning of the agreement that establishes the frame of autonomy of the territory, query modalities and the organisation of the referendum and, also, disposals in matter of security.
On the other hand, during these two years, and from the common position of the Council of Ministers, elaborated program of humanitarian help and of rehabilitation of urgency that took on the base of *Cáritas, by the importance that had the Catholic Church in *Timor Oriental and, particularly, Prize *Nobel Archbishop *Belo.
Regarding the question that presented Mr. *Bertens and Mrs. Go *Bladel on purpose of hospital, hospital of *Gaza is hospital of the *UNRAC, is not hospital of the European Commission or fact by the European Commission, is hospital of the *UNRAC.
Gentleman President, is very significant that Parliament, that has concerned enormously by the question of the human rights, go back once again on the subject of the International Penal Court in the last session of urgency on the human rights of this term of office.
Invites to mayors, managers, engineers and architects to collaborate in a common project that pretends to take advantage of in the new constructions energy facilitated by the sun instead of building of form that need electricity pertinent of the nuclear energy to heat the houses.

Report (To4-0259\/99) of Mr. *Jarzembowski in name of Transport Commission and Tourism on directive proposal of the #european Parliament and of the relative Council to the application of *gravámenes in the heavy vehicles of transport of commodities by utilisation of determined infrastructures ((*COM)96\/0331 - *C4-0027\/97-96\/0182(*COD)) - before 96\/0182 (*SYN)
The first proposed of the Commission broke seriously the balance among potato starch and grain. These proposals #would have had disastrous consequences for income of producers of potato starch.
Nevertheless, and in brief, believe that the Group of the Greens #would have to follow give advance and *ofrecerle support, but also consider that it #would have to carry out a suitable assessment of this type of events so that we #can take advantage of face experiences to the future and to the coming exhibitions.
The Commission expects to continue cooperation with the European Parliament and services to ensure that the participation of the Union in the *Expo 2000 was an important event that *acerque more the European Union and institutions to citizens.
Of habit, Fridays receive to visitor groups and #can *asegurarle that for citizens of my country that have had the privilege to visit the European Parliament, *usted is session President more popular.
Create deeply in the parliamentary institution and am deeply convinced that the *legitimación democratic of #all the process of #european integration assent on Parliament, the full recognition of paper and cooperation capacity with the national Parliaments.
pirouettes that finishes to execute *usted here, gentleman *Poettering, show nevertheless that the fall of the folds of suit #can not be and never will be so attractive like the of the that adorn face of Subject Minister External.
Want to congratulate personally of special mood no only to the Federal Chancellor but also to Subject Minister External, President of the Council that is here present, gentleman *Fischer, by not having saved efforts to go out of this difficult bellicose situation.
Thus, it is necessary to put prompt to disposal the necessary money for *ello and create the corresponding organisation so that we do not devote the greater part of work to that organisation coordinate with the #another but that the essential part of work devote to help sure enough to the *Balcanes and that convert at last in a peaceful region of this *Europa.
Gentleman President, the serious and negative repercussions of the financial crisis, of the *desaceleración of the economic growth in the European Union, -also in the era of the Economic and Monetary Union- have shown clearly of dramatic mood it necessary that it was the #european pact by employment of Colony.
*Les want to ask on disposal, his personal disposal to accept that they have to *rendir accounts and answer in front of citizens of *Europa by #everything it that take together with president, #as well as in front of this Assembly, with a clear public understanding and absolute that #this is the public forum of the #european democracy in front of the that owe *rendir accounts and answer publicly.
Nevertheless, wanted to plead by that, when acting like this, do not launch to boy with water of bath and comprise well that sometimes #one of the causes of failure of the previous Commission was the loss of the notion of public function.
Without a #european strategy in this sense, runs the risk that an economy like the #ours bend to concentrate resources in the strongest zones leaving to the *margen the feeblest, although #some have made remarkable progresses in the last time.
Gentleman President, gentlemen representatives of the Presidency of the Council, *Señorías, ladies and gentlemen, is not timely that the representative of the Commission in functions expose of extensive mood his opinion here on program of the Presidency #finnish of the Council as it treats of program that will apply in first line with the new Commission.
Without embargo, believe that President of country *nos has contributed the formidable demonstration of the contribution that Europeans #can contribute to peace in the continent and to the preparation of a #european solution to the #european problems.
Finally, concerning death pity, *me will allow that it signal to attention and *le insist so that the Presidency take part with #all weight in *Estambul and also in *Teherán, as in this last there #be thirteen #jewish that run the risk -know it-to be condemned to death pity simply for having been accused of espionage in favour of #Israel.
Am of the seem that #if we do not recognise errors of the past, will not be able to advance in the future, and it is necessary to say that, in it fundamental, the question from now is #if we will be able, without resorting to arms, to pipe the subjects related with the democratic transformations.
The 9 July 1999, #such as the Assembly will have heard to say to Mr. *Sasi, the Council decided to remit the subject to the Court of Justice protecting in article 213 of the Treaty; after said decision, now *le corresponds to the Court pronounce on the questions aroused.
Foresees besides examination procedure and of decision that include the specific capacity of the Commission to remit the question to a deontological committee *cuando the planned occupation of commissioner was related with wallet.
Perhaps the Assembly wish to know besides that, during conversations of month, #some members of the current Commission that always have respected fully his solemn commitment to fulfil the obligations of honesty and discretion have reiterated of fine wins and voluntarily said commitment.
It that *nos remains to *nosotros is to take reflection about the fault of consideration of #some members of the salient Commission on the need to adopt a rigorous approach regarding the high exigible criteria in the public life.
The *desenvoltura of Commissioner *Bangemann, that not even has had decency to expect months until the end of the agony of the Commission, *nos reveals until how point believe in this institution above the laws and of the public opinions.
Really is of it more *censurable that it have had no only an apparent *mofa of the official norms for commissioners, but also rape of the spirit of transparency and confidence that had to constitute the base of work among Parliament and commissioners.
After a deep debate, the Council reaffirmed in conclusions of the past June and remitted to the common political will, so much of the Commission as of the countries members, to carry out measures that require said conclusions in #all amplitude and of immediate form.
The Council applauded in general lines program proposed by the Commission, related with the deep review of legislation, on #whose details are *ustedes to the common, and that pretends to be adapted to legislation on foods of animal origin and to measures to take regarding the animal wastes.
But is clear that in moment more *álgido of the crisis is absurd that the Commission and his technical services lose time with discussions with the #belgian authorities and the technical services of #this, since there are not norms and since it do not knows how much dioxin #can have product.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, the crisis of dioxin, after the crisis of cows crazy, the American pressures directed to impose meat with hormones, are examples of the fearsome threats that weigh today day on the alimentary security of our *conciudadanos.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, for me at least has been comfort the that neither in this Assembly, neither in the European Commission, neither in the Council, nobody have considered the crisis of dioxins #belgian like a purely #belgian problem.
Sure enough, the problem of dioxins #belgian is also a #european problem, and the that it was a #european problem of course has to see with the only market, with politics in matter of competition, with the failure of the agricultural politics.
Take into account that the necessary liberalisation of the markets and the opening to third countries are to agriculture and to the *ganadería #european competitiveness heights hardly *superables and that #if they do not take effective preventive measures career by *abaratar costs of production *nos will carry, before or afterwards, to a new similar case.
Lady Speaker, *nos says *usted that only treats of modifications or of changes, but *nos #would enjoy that the Group of the European Socialists *nos said, in relation with amendment 1, #if it treats to add a nomination or of change, and #would wish to have answer in relation with the amendment 4 of the Group of the European Socialists.
look in the that want *centrarme of it that has said Mr. *Ford, is that the Commission, as it alleges, is a message to the organisers of the European Union managers of championships of *Europa 2000 and perhaps of Glass of the World that they #can take case *omiso of norms.
Want to urge to the Commission to that it show more prowess in front of the governments and to inform to Parliament *cuando the governments hinder attitudes and clear decisions of the Commission through behaviour dilatory, of decision absence or of utilisation *improcedente and unsuitable of influence.
treats, of course, as it #can read in the conclusions of the report of experts, further of the own bad operation, of a problem of mentality, that, obviously, do not puts in *entredicho to civil servants of the Commission, but that reveals structural lacks of this institution, that are not of technical character, but of political order.
control by the European Parliament, of course, and, for example, our Assembly #would have to, after this report of experts, request new audits on concrete points, or even appoint an or varied commissions of investigation to launch light in #some fields still dark, like the evaluation of the real effects of subventions community.
Is much better, in place to pretend an environmental inspection *supranacional, with #all difficulties related with entrance right, that #can ensure that the valid legislation guarantee that the environmental inspectors of #all States members (to) exist and (*b) carry out tasks pretty much according to guidelines.
And once again *nos find in front of a dilemma that is the authentic alternative of the devil: *cuando the European Commission proposes a recommendation *ustedes want a directive, and *cuando the Commission proposes a directive, it is necessary to take recommendations because it is necessary to respect subsidiariness principle.
To know personality and the suitability of candidates to exert charges believe that the public audiences have been a positive exercise of democracy and transparency, without that they have triumphed the that pretended *convertirlas in witch hunting.
*Ello only #would contribute to erode confidence of society in the institutions of the Union, it that #would suppose a step backwards for #all parts interested, in particular, to the light of the decisive challenges that await to the Union like political and economic entity.
Gentleman President, the statement of President designated of the Commission confirms his previous interventions, mainly in front of this Assembly, days 13 April or 4 May last, and deputies #french of my group will see therefore forced to vote against.
Therefore, our more important priority #would have to be go back to achieve the participation of the constituent *desencantado: a European Commission reformed, a European Parliament reformed, that relate of a firm way, but mature, is the only path by the that have #any real hope to achieve it.
To appeal of the groups, and especially of the #ours, gentleman *Prodi has assumed clear commitments regarding transparency of actions of the Commission, to the *concertación with Parliament, to responsibility of members of the Commission in front of this Assembly.
*Yo wanted to require it following: in the first place, *yo did not have intervention to the beginning of the session and, second, precision of yesterday did not seems to have served of at all, since again it did not appears in Record it that really said and the following point contradicts the content of my words.
Conscious that #that is the main task of the Commission, manifest to professor *Prodi and to members of the Commission the wish of a good work and declare that it will have the vote of deputies #portuguese of the Popular Party European.
Have appreciated introduction, expect that it give a positive answer to sections of our resolution, and have confidence in the capacity of Mr. *Prodi to direct the Commission of way responsible and expert.
The operation and the management of Transport Direction have been exemplary and believe that with experience in modernisation of the Party *Laborista of Realm Joined, has the necessary aptitudes to undertake work.
Determined opinions that #can *resumir of the following mood: in the first place, know that *Europa has taken from two strengths *dialécticamente constructive: #that that, conscious of weight of history, defend the *pervivencia and the force of the national State and #that #others that, with greater launch, think in a future of greater integration, #whose political definition still is not among *nosotros, and perhaps was #that #one of the advantages of this construction.
To win resistances needs originality and energy, Mr. President, and wish that have *usted of unseen reservations of genders, as to judge by the speeches that until today *le have listened, #many of *nosotros think that no *nos have provided sufficient indications of *ello, and especially do not warn indications that it exist the new mentality that precise for *encarar so much the deep crisis of confidence in that it has *sumido *Europa like the problems of unemployment and security.
Although cuts is *algo usual in this stage of the budgetary procedure, this year come to add to a substantial redistribution of 430 millions of euros in category 4 - external actions - to fund reconstruction of *Kosovo by value of 500 millions of euros.
In bottom, gentleman President, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, *señorías, have to say that no *nos had seduced budget preliminary draft of the Commission. No *nos had seduced the preliminary draft of the Commission and *nos disillusioned budget project of the Council.
Want to ask to the Council that *replantee proposal and that guarantee that representation of the European Parliament in organ correspond to it that in reality is the European Parliament, is to say, that was reflection of #all the political strengths, #all currents, #all the opinions that give in this moment in *Europa.
Lady Speaker, the European Council of Colony had the unlucky idea -without that any national parliament *le have demanded, that *yo know, at all to the *respecto- to launch the preparation of a Letter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
The Cut occupies of the question of impunity and offers an impartial forum for trials, with it that will help to facilitate the international tensions and to promote peace and security in the national plane and in the international.
Lady Speaker, *yo expect that, after the statement that has taken Speaker in exercise of the Council, this Summit of *Tampere #can suppose a firm commitment of political will by part of the Union, #where collect #all a series of orientations clear and precise that *nos allow to follow advancing.
In the previous term of office, Parliament said yes to the Monetary Union, said yes to the social integration taking of employment the centre and engine of the #european social politics, and now have to say also yes to a #european space of freedom, of security and justice.
Lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, Mrs. *Halonen, speech, with the concrete proposals that has included, *me has satisfied especially because it reinforces conviction that *Tampere #can really suppose moment summit, an authentic milestone, a new impulse to the process of #european construction.
To similarity of mates of the Party of the European Socialists, particularly attentive and *asiduos with occasion of auditions of candidates to Commissioners, *me congratulate of this procedure that offers educations on personality and the intentions of those who will be our privileged speakers.
Therefore, #if well I go to vote midday without a state of particular spirit the investiture of this Commission *deseándole spirit and luck, inside some weeks will be particularly attentive to program that will announce for the year 2000 and the term of office.
In the agricultural sector has insisted in the great orientations of the *PAC -Political Agricultural Common- and a greater liberalisation of the markets, keeping injustices in distribution of supports and subventions, with clear damage for agriculture familiar and of countries like *Portugal in the that predominate the small agricultural exploitations.
silence of Mr. *Prodi on the need to defend the social model European, his *consternadora abstemiousness and even his frequent omissions concerning a #european politics in *pro of employment, his careful generalities on the institutional modification inspire more reservations.
My argument is that President of the Commission, Roman *Prodi, obtained in May of the year in course the vote of an important majority of the European Parliament to carry out with squad *intachable a wide program of reforms with seen to the necessary *saneamiento of the Commission.
Had account of the serious doubts on the professional aptitude of the #belgian #Philippe *Busquin and his consequent capacity to assume Investigation wallet, without forgetting the *sinfín of recriminations to the that have given place his muddy businesses, *Prodi #would have to have denied categorically to accept to candidate!
It bad is that in this moment *yo am not able to estimate #if with the *quinto budget *rectificativo will get to final of year or #if to December already will be with the *nº 7, which do not has to *extrañar #if it takes into account that the same Commission has contributed in work document assessments very different to hour to motivate resources required.
Appreciate to the Presidency #finnish action that carries out in Nations Joined on the question of the abolition of death pity and *me cheer a lot to know that, thanks to the Presidency #finnish -and no only to *ella, of course-, this year will have a resolution in New *York.
#One of management roads of this problem, necessary although no only, is help to refugees, without damage that in the frame of peace negotiations reach a permanent solution further of the therapeutic of help.
The Council has proposed an ineffective procedure, by it that pray that they comprise that we accept the headquarters in *Tesalónica like operative part, like part of Reconstruction Agency for the whole of the *Sudeste of *Europa with headquarters in *Tesalónica, but that it has to be linked very closely to the headquarters of the stability pact in *Tesalónica.
deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of Nations consider that in this field of the accidental marine pollution, the existence of a true common interest justifies the creation of a community frame.
In effect, these three programs at present do not establish action in this sector and is not desirable to favour dispersion of means, in detriment of programs *prioritarios for the economic development of next countries to the European Union, candidates to adhesion.
For *nosotros, the body of #european control has to follow being the current, is to say, a body that allow to check, to time, #if control bodies of States members apply the community regulation, to avert, of course, distortions of competition among the different States members.
The resolution that finishes to approve the European Parliament on the preparation of a Letter of the fundamental rights of the Union illustrates perfectly the risk that they produce unfit, as I reported in my intervention of yesterday, during the main debate.
In the meantime, the decision on an answer to speculations and allegations of bad utilisation of help bottoms is, mainly, responsibility of #FMI, the World-wide Bank and the countries of the *G7, since they are #this obviously the main providers of the direct financial help.
Gentleman President, do not want to interrupt the debate but like this debate and explanation of Commissioner *Kinnock have to to the urgent wish of #some political groups, wanted to *rogarle that transmit also to the Conference of Presidents the wish that said political groups have present at least a minimum of deputies.
#If we want to follow investing in the #russian economy, have to find means to support and develop the local economic activity - as it finishes to say colleague - so that it attend to the needs of the population and provide stability feeling and of participation.
has to ask to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in *Europa that present a report to Parliament, the Commission and the Council. The present conjoint appeal of diverse political groups pretends especially that it #can obtain it before possible and of reliable mood information of this type.
In occasion were reasonable and *nos put of agreement. Now our task is the to help to persons that there live in development, that perhaps #can pass of similar mood but that in any case *les open a future in the that it was ensured existence and in the that they #can take destination in his own hands.
Still are cool in the memory the murders committed in autumn of the year happened on four independent minds and, of course, no it is necessary to forget the extraordinarily brutal performance of gang of bullies of the conservative faction of the *jurisconsulto supreme *Khamenei.

To #all *nos concerns the good use of money of the #european taxpayer and *yo regret sincerely rage of colleague #dutch that, against of idea of #european solidarity, has considered timely to assume defence of "taxpayers.
Understand, lady Speaker, that there #be had orator in favour of the proposal and orator, that finishes to incorporate to seat, that has presented the idea to celebrate a debate on this subject to final of month, in the second partial period of sessions of October.
The Council and the Commission wanted to take measure of restlessness, but in actuality seem little able to provide other different solutions to regulations *puntillosas but pusillanimous, that the most cunning and the less *escrupulosos will follow evading in detriment of the alimentary security.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, every time results clearer that the problem of the public health and the healthy feeding is a true #european problem, a world-wide problem, and that is not the problem of solo Been member.
#If like this we take it, believe that we will be able to *decirles to citizens and citizens: at all #can guarantee with security in life, but *les are the maximum grade of security, welfare and health that at present *les #can offer from sight point of the human possibilities and the scientific recommendations.
Now well, *nos have *enterado with stupor that, against of the opinion of Development Commission and Cooperation, the budget for AIDS #would have reduced to half, which #would be a scandal, in front of urgency of the situation, and contradictory with the words of gentleman *Nielson.
And -it that is not less important- is *usted had to procure cooperation with the pharmaceutical companies, by part, to accelerate the work with seen to #obtaining of vaccine and, second, manufacture medicines more accessible for the poor of this world?
During the debate around the question of employment of condom also have taken fine note of the wide existent consensus on the decisive importance to put to disposal of the population cheap condoms and *informarles of precise and honest form, as it has *sucedido in *Tanzania, *Uganda and *Senegal.
Believe that *eso *nos #would pose a difficulty of respect of the budgetary authority and to analyse form subjects *parcelada, of form that #can not have a global vision of difficulties that *nos #can pose.
The evaluation showed also that actions with charge to *SAVE *propiciarán also indirectly the achievement of the goals of investigation program and innovation in matter of energy no nuclear by means of the creation of a half positive for diffusion and the application of the new technologies in matter of renewable energies.

How measured has adopted the Commission and #which thinks to adopt in the future to apply the common Action and Resolution on light arms adopted by the Council and *subsiguientemente the Resolution of the Development Council of the EU on light arms?

Also pretended to accuse to the then Minister of Agriculture of a supposed fraud in adjudication of helps, but results that control competition and payment of helps of the *PAC is of the regional governments, according to competition cast of the #spanish State.
Besides, also have tried to create the necessary conditions for advance of the peace process, for distention of the situation and so that satisfied an environment of favourable opinion to this process.
help to development and the technical assistance in subjects like the agreement of stable zones and the operation of the Administration have been the fields to the that it has allocated and will follow allocating help.
*Permítame likewise express my gratitude to the Development Committee and Cooperation and to #all Parliament by the thorough report and by support, in the frame of query procedure, to efforts of the Commission for *ultimar the agreement.
Gentleman President, #all celebrate the relaunching of the peace process in Orient Next; without embargo, know that history and the circumstances of conflict are dramatic and that, along the years, diverse initiatives, that seemed to open a future of hope, have finished blocked owing to the *intransigencia, fault of political will or *cortedad of watch of #one of parts.

In the last days Europeans have seen with big indignation and stupor, that in a country with the that *nos join bows of friendship and to the that Europeans, and especially my country, have so much that appreciate, is to say, in States Joined of *América, is possible still, to the protect of the Law, carry in front of the courts to boys -and no *me refer to youngsters of 17 or of 18 years, but to boys of 11 and of 10 years- and *sacarlos of houses manacled and with *grilletes in feet.
Now well, when reading my references and the of varied deputies of my Group, do not see the name of my party or of my Group, *Europa of Nations, but a totally subjective assessment: opposite nationalist to the European Union.
Lady Speaker, in relation with question of the reception of television programs that has posed my colleague Mrs. *Plooij-go *Gorsel, wanted to express hope that the technical problems that at present prevent BBC reception1 and BBC2 #can resolve.
Nowadays, talk of the community contributions is to talk the majority of times that the poor of the rich countries see taxed with taxes that *redundan in benefit of the rich of the poor countries and thus #any of *nosotros wants to carry out cast politics, and fundamentally #this *sucede through the numerous diets of community help.
Therefore, celebrate to a large extent, and to *ello has referred already in brief orator that *me has preceded, that the directive no only contemplate to persons that find precisely in the interior of cabin of transport installation by wire, but also to persons that descend in seasons or that expect game.
As it has said takes moments, opens the path to competition in this sector that, in the field of technology and of security, purchases a fundamental look because competition is it that it is: serves to improve technician.
Now well, from sight point, how doubt fits that the technical disposals that will follow this directive and that will establish in other forums and after meetings, will constitute the fundamental element to define permission of this directive in #all States members.
For *nosotros is essential that the speaker and the speaker for the year 2001 study in *algún moment how parts exactly belong to part To of the budget and how parts belong to part *B. And am especially of category To 30. When help organisation #can resort to the #european bottoms?
To #that *respecto, want to manifest no only a deep disagreement with the horizontal reductions and *indiscriminadas that proposes the Council for category, but also affirm the agreement in general with the strategy that *nos proposes the speaker and that, in it essential, goes directed to a review of the Financial Perspectives to end to give answer to new priorities, without that thus they result affected previous goals.
Right Commission of Woman presented, the same that the past year, comment and a budget for line To-3037, corresponding to the *Lobby European of Women, but the comment says now that line remains opened for #all the no governmental organisations.
By #this have to procure boost innovation in schools, have to strengthen the initiative, innovation in education centres -from the primary school until university-, so as to generate a new impulse and open also new opportunities in this field.
since information that contains the annual report is of nature *autoexplicativa, perhaps result more useful to centre my observations here and now in #some of the subjects that treat in the resolution project elaborated by his Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary.
In *tercer place, #ECB had to debate of periodic form the evolution in each #one of States members of the zone of the euro for like this have a positive influence on the evolution of prices and wages that, #such as it has signalled aptly Mr. *Duisenberg, have to vary of a Been member to #another.
In the first place, the no self-evident report, to my seem, so much by content as in editorial, a sufficient will by part of the Central Bank European to subject to the democratic control of the European Parliament.
Exists suspicion, better said, more that suspicion, that this decision took by political pressures - think, for example, to *Oskar *Lafontaine - and that, through the approval of today, Parliament pretends to confirm tendency to a Central Bank subordinated to the requirements of politics or even of the electoral interests.
But, as I said takes #some days in front of the General Assembly of Nations Joined, do not want peace to price, but peace that strengthen really democracy, that preserve the territory and that allow to each #one of citizens the full exercise of #all rights and freedoms.
The central decision in the creation of the space of justice #european has been to establish like base of cooperation the mutual recognition of the decisions and judicial sentences, so much in subjects of civil right, as of penal right.
The decisions of the Council do not contain #any appointment on mood to deliver, inside the Union, the derivative economic charges of refugees and of asylum applicants.
Regarding the relative measures to asylum right and to immigration, result totally indeterminate and little *apremiantes; the only fine news is respect of Gin Agreement and the reaffirmation of the fight against racism.
Subscribe fully the statement issued by the leaders of the EU *cuando expressed his deep weigh in front of the decision of the Senate of States Joined of not ratifying the Treaty of Complete Prohibition of the Nuclear Essays.
Under look and taking into account the decision of the relative Council to competitions of the Agency, #would have to get to agreements to reach of durable mood reconciliation in the whole of the *Balcanes and establish links with the stability pact.
The subject of asylum, immigration and delinquency *transfronteriza, #as well as the administration of justice *repercuten on the fundamental subjects of the human rights and the civil rights of individual.
Gentleman President, the results of the summit of *Tampere *me seem a basically positive signal for citizens of the European Union because they put on of the table question that *nos affect to #all, but, especially, because they open the door to development of politics that demand the own citizens.
Gentleman President, no fits doubt that the Council of *Tampere is a qualitative jump in the path to the #european integration and that in this work, has been very important the contribution of the Presidency #finnish, to the *cual *le give my more cordial *enhorabuena.
By part, measures *intergubernamentales, directly executable road plans of action, but essentially directed to brake immigration. On the other hand, mandates directed to the European Commission, regarding the politics of common asylum and the protection of asylum applicants.
Wanted to, gentleman President, express gratitude to Prime minister #Jean-*Luc *Dehaene, to President *von *Weizsäcker and to *Lord #Simon by the quality of contribution and give graces also to His *Señorías, here, by his received and by attention that loan to report, in particular in the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, lively and chaired by Mr. *Napolitano.
Although #if they stopped to think moment, #would not take in giving account that country, any country, probably lose more of vetos issued by countries that it that win taking use of the own in fields of competition of the European Union.
In the questions related with reform of the institutions, remits to a concept *tecnográfico of increase of efficiency and of capacity of performance without throwing at least glimpse to the so necessary and urgent question of the construction of a #european democracy.
Am very appreciated by this opportunity that *me offers to comment the amendments of Parliament and *permítanme take advantage of the opportunity to present respects to his *Señoría and to colleagues for having taken so much interest in this subject so important.
The *segunda question that has given place to a series of amendments is the wish to situate the Agency under the only and direct responsibility of the Commission, that #would be manager to appoint to director.
The previous rule was abolished and, in consequence, is urgent to adopt a position regarding modification procedures of the distinct norms that go approving, especially in those important and delicate matters, #this is, #if it has to prevail the opinion, the opinion of the Commission or of the Council.
In effect, believe that, #if well it is necessary to cheer that advances of the computer facilitate the commercial exchanges, no thus it is necessary to leave to be watchdogs and watch by a just balance among the interests of service borrowers and the protection of consumers.
Until day of today in the European Union there #be an institutional frame that consists in two directives: the directive on the collective dismissals and the directive on the #european commission of company.
The only possible politics for the full employment of the #european workers is the of *reconquistar the inner market, protect it against the disloyal competition, renounce to #one *mundialización criminal and antisocial; is the to reestablish the necessary norm of the community preference.
*Permítanme, first of all, hail the fact that it have practically unanimity among the Council, the Commission, and expect that Parliament, on a subject so crucial in moment in the that we have to give decisive steps in the configuration of an external politics and of common security.
value and the judicial independence of judge *Gimblett - value of #Angela *Zelter and of mates contrast strongly with the *petulante rejection by part of the American Senate of the Treaty of total prohibition of the nuclear proofs.
The Russians, *comprensiblemente, are a big interest by the enlargement process, and the European Union is had to undertake a serious dialogue with *ellos in the frame of the Association Agreement and Cooperation.
Especially, provides a human face to the far bureaucratic politics #european, plants to citizens in the central point of performances and of the debate, #such as it occurs in program "Youth" and in training program "#Socrates" .
On the other hand, agree with the Council in the need that the actions of Culture 2000 are visible for the public opinion, but the best way to achieve it are the small performances or the average, the disperse, the near to citizens, and no the great events.
#would Consider especially unaware that Parliament did not follow the recommendations of the speaker, since it #can not follow saying that it is regrettable that every time vote less persons in the #european elections or that it is *desconsolador that of survey result that *Europa is increasingly far of Europeans and, go to save in projects that, precisely, have like goal *acercar *Europa to persons.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, on 28 August 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a resolution of the European Parliament and of the Council with the goal to introduce the common program of action "Youth" for the period comprised among the 2000 and the 2004.
Regarding analysing factors that have boosted or *entorpecido the social integration of youngsters, consider fundamental to include an analysis of the influence of family or of family fault in development of youngsters.
As it has posed this question, wanted to signal concerning information relative to the Young "programs" that network *Eurodesk, that is a combination of spots in Internet and councils for youngsters, is available in #all the countries and in #all tongues of the Union.
Said commitment no only has deserved the agreement of Budget Commission, but also the of the competent commission for bottom, especially with support of Mrs. *McNally, speaker, to the one who give graces by cooperation.
From sight point, no of my political Group, but of the previous Parliament, of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, that approved by unanimity this report, really, there #be not any fault of clarity.
Recommendation for the *segunda reading (To5-0026\/1999) of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council [<lpar>$^13328<num>$/^2<num>$/^1998<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0023<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1998<num>$/^0169<num>$^(<lpar>$^*COD$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> with seen to the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council by the that establishes an only instrument of finance and of programming in favour of the cultural cooperation (Program "Culture 2000" ) (Speaker: Mr. *Graça *Moura)
Alas the position of the Council no favours neither the democratic freedoms neither the human rights in *Turquía; neither neither the solution of the problem of *Chipre, neither the of the question *kurda; neither neither support to the tragic victims of the earthquakes registered in *Turquía.
Therefore, in spite of having full consciousness that progression of the community costs is sometimes difficult to bear by the public finances of States members, have voted in favour of the resolution proposed by the general speaker of the budget.
. (OF) The delegation of the Liberal Party Austrian will refuse in whole the resolution proposal of Mr. *Bourlanges (Section *III - Commission) #as well as the of Mr. *Virrankoski (sections), since the budget did not fulfils the basic criteria of transparency and efficiency.
As it has said Mr. #Gil-Oaks, and *yo had said previously, *nos find at present in a situation in the that the institutional agreement, regarding the *OLAF, applies to the Commission, to the Council and to personnel of this Institution, but did not applies to deputies of this Institution.
Is true that in the Agreement *interinstitucional talks explicitly of members of the institutions, but *cuando reads this expression in his context, *nos give account that it treats rather of salaried members, like members of the Commission, and that disposals adopted do not adapt to members chosen, like deputies to the European Parliament.
The *insensibilidad and cynicism no only are accepted by the EU and organs, but that they are besides funded in the frame of a politics of direct economic reinforcements or indirect #whose goal is competitiveness in the world-wide field.
Is to say, gentleman *Fischler, on 1 December will lose employment 7.000 #european fishermen, 477 fuselages community will remain tied up in ports, 10.000 places of work in industries *conserveras and of transformation will be in danger, and #others thousands of employments more, related with commercialisation and with the port activities, also *peligrarán.
But also because, to these heights, unemployment of activities *pesqueras seems unavoidable, it that forces, as it occurred in moment of the expiration of the previous agreement, to look for extraordinary community bottoms to fund stop time of the fleet.
But yes want to insist in that, by #all reasons so known, the fleet is in *vilo, and as also *ella has to pay an every time greater part of fishing agreements, already has declared that it is not had to not receiving information of it that happen during these negotiations.
Conceded to *Marruecos a commercial agreement without limit of term and obtained fishing agreement with limit of term: it that means that *Marruecos plants to will products in the territory of the European Union, but *nosotros only #can fish in waters #moroccan until 30 November 1999.
In this moment, are of the future of the neighbouring countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental by means of incorporation to the European Union, but also have to *preocuparnos by the future of the neighbouring countries of bank south of the Mediterranean.
By it other, the Committee of #british Experts no impugns these figures that were repeated by the director of the public health in *Escocia, that declared: "have present the fact that in this country exists a risk for the human health".
Gentleman President, first of all wanted to affirm that I am in favour of the principle of caution in a field #where health of consumers is directly loomed, but the debate that here takes place among adherents and opponents of the embargo is of a total hypocrisy.
On the other hand, this Protocol supposes a natural step until the signature of the new Agreement, that #can run risks given the political situation of the country and the presence of fleets #if the European Union *ausentara of the zone.
In the last seven years the taxpayers of the European Union have paid 1.400 millions of euros to Governments and to other institutions and, even with the neutral words of the Commission, is difficult to control destination that gives to money.
And disagree absolute and radically of posture of orator that *me has preceded in the use of the word, the one who has manifested politics very little *solidaria with States members of the European Union, very little *solidaria with fishermen, posture that is, fortunately, minoritary in this Assembly.
To begin, wanted to inform to His *Señorías on the *dictamen adopted by unanimity by the Managerial Committee Scientist the past Friday and based in the scientific foundations of the *dictamen of the French Agency of Security of the Alimentary Health (*AFSSA) concerning the applicable measures to meat exports of bovine #british.
export plan according to a calendar established conceived by the Commission with advice of scientists is, in my opinion and in the of scientists that advise to the Commission in these subjects, the that will give security to consumers.
Fits to stand out that diet change introduced from the set up of the Economic and Monetary Union has facilitated the task of managers of politics *macroeconómicas national and is to surpass obstacles, so that growth #can be more durable.
With regard to diagnostic on the *coyuntura, #all participants agreed in that the perspectives have improved of significant form, and in that the negative external crash of the year 1998 seems that it has absorbed already with the internal development of the own European Union.
Regarding the economic politics -the second document already gives answer to the challenge that constitutes to transform backstitch circumstantial in a durable process of growth higher-, each #one of participants exposed sight point of form very frank.
In the budgetary procedure have found means class to reach work agreement so that this institution, together with the Commission, keep confidentiality and #can take the same in the case of dialogue.
Is a social catastrophe even in the countries of *Europa that affirm to have less unemployed and, watches by where, the European Council of Colony and the European Commission content with *atiborrarse with words talking of #european pact in *pro of employment, but, had account of amplitude of the problem, the planned measures are ridiculous.
Of mood, wanted to take part next Monday in the political debate on #which will be the effects of type rise of interest, that predictably will produce tomorrow, and no only of the effects on the types of *cotización of day, but also the effects on the real economy.
Wanted to underline that the goal of dialogue *macroeconómico, #such as it outlined also in Colony, has in core the need to combine development and employment. And debate and apply for the first time a #european politics for employment is #one of the most important questions of the *Europa of today.
The two parts of industry accepted to be included in the general directive, as long as they reached parallel advances in the sector of transport by road, because, as it is natural, fear to suffer disadvantage in matter of competition, #if they establish disposals very wide on the labour day and the sector of transport by road do not takes it own.
The labour day for more of a chamber of million of doctors in period of training in the European Union is health question and security for the own doctors, that have to have rights to *salvaguardar health and his personal life that #that to the that treat.
Believe that #everyone in this Assembly #would receive with *beneplácito the opportunity to give a very positive and affirmative vote in favour of the proposals presented by Mrs. *Smith in report concerning the reduction of the transitory period to four years.
*Cuando formulated the directive on the labour day of 1993, sectors remained excluded of field of application and reason is very clear: the own specific characteristics of #some of the sectors interested required legislation that took into account said characteristic and particular needs.
. (*SV) Gentleman President, is obvious that it is an enormous event the that the EU celebrate the Agreement of scientific cooperation and technical with the Popular Republic of Chinese, since #all know that Chinese is a big country that goes to decide a fine part of our common future.
Besides, His *Señoría has talked, with reason, of the question of the private companies and think also, as His *Señoría, that the presence of companies in collaboration project is element stood out in #all program-mark and that results particularly important in this type of agreement.
The European Economic Community and the Argentinian Republic have interest in collaborating in the mutual help because, without damage that Argentinian is a young country, *yo believe that it is very important that #all this Latin American area associate fully to the *quinto programs frame of investigation and technological development.
And inside this strategic goal, treats to achieve, among the operative goals, the boost employment and ensure coordination of the social protection and #all the field of the protection of the rights of citizens.
The strategic document subjected to examination represents, without place to doubts, an important step in the only market and expands and consolidates the idea of an only market that it is #one of the fundamental cores in the #european construction.
To this *respecto, Mr. *Harbour and the members of Parliament #can be safe that the Commission seeks to be *responsive *and flexible, for saying it with the words of Mr. *Harbour, so that flexibility *nos allow to confront the needs of moment without losing of sight the interests of consumer.
do not want *referirme now of way *particularizada to the conclusions, without embargo to sight of the debate that took place yesterday in Plenary about dialogue *macroeconómico wanted to mention point: the European Parliament #would have to be included also in the preparation and put in practice of the #european pact on employment.
The majority of the proposals that Right Commission of Woman and *yo have presented already has approved by the commission, but a pair of essential subjects were refused, in particular the amendments 37, 38 and 39.
Instead, a committee, a committee *apolítico runs the risk to be a house of compensation in that it treats to subtract *dramatismo to the debate, to find political alternatives that exist in virtue of consensus precisely neutral and *apolítico to the that believe that it is impossible to get in matter of employment.
The goal announced with the introduction of coin only seem to be the to establish confidence in the economic politics through stability of the monetary politics, of prices and budgetary, #as well as by means of moderation *salarial and flexibility.
Without embargo, today dialogues *macroeconómicos national have moved to the regional field; the *concertación has involved the regions and the territory and programming capacity in utilisation of the structural instruments and in conceiving models of local development.
Likewise, reserves a fundamental paper to the social speakers in employment strategies and of social integration and no exists still a clear definition of paper of #the same, especially in organisation facet no governmental.
Gentleman President, the figures of unemployment and of poverty in *Europa follow being catastrophic: sixty millions of poor, a 9% of unemployed, a 25% of juvenile unemployment; is not precisely it that says a positive balance, especially taking into account that calm of 1999 has to more that swims to an improvement of the *coyuntura in the that neither the governments, neither the European Union have had at all that see.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, as it #can check in the reports on employment politics of States members, there #be a high *incumplimiento of the guidelines on employment and unemployment levels keep very elevated -in particular, in the of long length-, it that affects especially to youngsters and to women.
By reason, consider important the two parts that now are *resumidas in the Report *Menrad as, by part, peace and security and, by #another, growth and employment constitute the supreme priority of politics of the European Union.
In *tercer place, have to promote innovation in the field of training, as with training youngsters and also #a lot of unemployed of long length do not find occupation in work market by *carecer still of the necessary qualification for the new technical developments.
To day of today lines guidelines for employment have debated in Employment Commission and in the Commission of Economic Subjects, and keep intense conversations to get to the Council, #where believe that they will adopt without reservations and will debate officially on 29 November, in the mixed Council of Ministers of Economy and Ministers of Work.
#If it applies norm to the small Groups that to the great, or to the great Groups that to the small, do not believe that *ello carry to the conclusion that it #would suit to dissolve the Group *PPE by the fact that #such or *cual national faction have in independence Parliament of vote.
Take note of the indication of the European Parliament to link the fiscal incentives to companies "so that they contribute really to the creation of places of work and no to restructurings and to the *deslocalizaciones that involve dismissals" , so as to not repeating the scandal of company *Michelin.
To this *respecto, the new section 2 of article 299 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, when recognising the peculiarities of the #french departments of *Ultramar like regions *ultraperiféricas of the Union, *nos offers the possibility to adopt measures of exception to the community right in benefit of development.
The political call "of employment" will remain in the best of the cases reduced to #some vain sentences, in the worst of the cases will follow serving of pretext to subsidise to the in depth #stray companies, whereas they will not take authoritarian measures to forbid that the great #european companies suppress put of work while have benefits.
The fact that, precisely in this field, the #european States grouped in the Union refuse to adopt measures *vinculantes shows that his main worry is the to go clearing obstacles, included the social, so that the great companies take out the maximum benefit, and in no way to put end to unemployment.
The Group of the Greens and the Group of the Party of the European Socialists request that it inscribe in the agenda, of the 9 to the 10 hours, the presentation of the annual report of the Court of Accounts.
Lady Speaker, believe that it is a question that explains by himself\/hisself alone in measure in that we already debate in the previous Plenary the importance that Parliament adopted development norms and application of an agreement *interinstitucional, that has been already *concertado in the past term of office and ratified by Parliament.
Perhaps, so that colleagues have clear the subject, as it argued in the Conference of Presidents, #can require that, given the predictable absence of Mr. *Patten, have suggested the name of Mr. *Verheugen no to personal title, but because it is #one of Commissioners that devote to the international subjects.
In my opinion, the Speaker of the report, *Lange, is entirely in it true *cuando proposes to carry the question of the heavy vehicles to the sphere of a common strategy to reduce what before CO2 broadcast in roads.
Now there are car industries that for values limit of *NOx more strict take like point of reference the 2005, the first reading of the European Parliament. #Others take the reference of the 2008, the common position of the Council, and #others the of the 2006, the review proposal for the *segunda reading.
The Council of Ministers of Environment adopted on 20 December of the year happened some valuable amendments of colleague *Hautala, that consisted in #one value strict limit to combat pollution and particle broadcast *cancerígenas of the heavy vehicles.
Finally, wanted to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner *António *Vitorino, that was in the Summit of *Tampere, for *pedirle that *nos say how goes to concretise, in practice, the final decision of the Council, that applaud, of *tipificar like penal offence violence against human beings, in particular against boys and women.
As we have seen in the debate precedent, the Commission already is in varied relative fields to boys, although competition of action in the majority of the important spheres of these fields follows in hands of States members.
did not argue in the negotiation table on the directive that are and wanted to answer also to the question of Mrs. *Ghilardotti on #which are data on the that still there are doubts and data in the that there #be disagreement among the national Parliaments.
In the *primer report of March has exposed #all a series of positive questions, an ecological tax, tax on CO2 broadcasts, tax on the *gravamen of speculative benefits in the short term and the benefits of #ECB.
#If the European Union decides, by a democratic procedure, that the own resources are simply a direct percentage of #GDP collected by States members and transferred in a global quantity, as very well: *eso will be the own resources and will be democratic.
changes, #as well as the reinforcement of the budgetary discipline, that is visible so much in the conclusions of the Presidency of *Berlín, as in the new Agreement *Interinstitucional, provide the basic stimuluses for the need to modify and complete the valid decision with new mechanisms.
say It because in the Agreement *interinstitucional appear as merely *indicativos and out of the financial perspectives, in the Annex *II; it only that they are financial perspectives is the Annex *I. Instead, the proposal of the Commission includes costs that do not form part of the financial perspectives inside the guideline.
In this context want to say also that in brief *deliberaremos in the commission with big detail together with the Commission on how additional regulations are necessary in the sector of the electrical current and of gas, as against of #all affirmations made follow without having still a #european market but 15 different markets.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, Mr. *Chichester has declared with tarpaulin in report, that the environmental approach has to contain a better energetic politics that the of before, but assuming States members a basic responsibility in accordance with this principle, fundamental in matter of energetic politics.
Like private lawyer that exerts the profession in Realm Joined, with frequency have had to *lidiar with book battery to find the pertinent norms and the ideal form to proceed in name of customers in these circumstances.
boy has to have the possibility to be listened in front of the Court to show like this clearly that it takes into account welfare and expect that commitment solution of my colleague *Watson do not believes here additional problems and that we #can regulate this important subject in favour of boy.
The #european construction has ignored during too much time the right of persons, and the *Europa of citizens, #whose expression are *nosotros, has to take into account from now on, said it yesterday in the afternoon with reason of the *X anniversary of the international Agreement, the concrete worries of families and the welfare of boys.
The amendment *nº 3, except better opinion, do not contributes at all new to disposal, in measure in that States members that will designate an only authority, is to say, a central authority, are precisely the that in right do not admit the direct transmission of decisions.
*Señorías, the regulation foresees term of four months for the presentation of the plans of economic development by part of the national authorities and term of five months for the approval of these proposals.
As, in the first place, there are measures that are in course and that there #be continue and promote, like adhesion of the European Community to *Eurocontrol, process that will allow no only incorporate a greater political responsibility by part of the European Union but, besides, that set up the last convention and, therefore, that #can adopt measures in function of votes majority, by majorities, and not having to resort systematically to unanimities.
As they know, the Council of the past Monday, two days ago, has condemned the disproportionate use and *indiscriminado of strength in *Chechenia, that has caused great sufferings to the civil population and has forced alas to #a lot of *decenas of thousands of persons to displace to zones of the country.
In this sense, the Presidency #finnish has made an extraordinary work, that will reflect in a report to the European Council of *Helsinki on the no military instruments for crisis management.
Expect that we #can have the continuous support of Parliament to hour to develop procedures more flexible and faster and, as I am safe that the High Representative will be had to recognise, do not lose any opportunity to pose this same question to the Council.
Like this, the permanent research of effects in the short term in detriment of the long term, the need of personal glorification of president #french, zero, #all these discussions and other protocols of *Nuremberg #can damage the subtle relations of geopolitical strength that existed from takes *lustros among States Joined, *Francia, Big *Bretaña and *Alemania.
In line, had the opportunity of *preguntarle in appearance in front of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence #which #would be the political means -and thought, fundamentally, in the Conference *Intergubernamental- to take advantage of the next Conference *Intergubernamental in benefit of the *PESC.
Gentleman President, backrest of the greater part of my Group to the construction of the #european identity of defence has a lot that see, although no #everything, with the lesson learnt in war of *Kosovo and the idea that, in #some cases, alas, is necessary intervention armed in front of the massive rapes of human rights.
In the field of services -the market with a greater potential of expansion, especially for the #european providers-, is precise to improve access to the markets with the inclusion of new fields, #if well it is indispensable that consult explicitly to the European Parliament in look.
Gentleman President, have presented a question of relative order to the Report *Haug, because the original version is #german and, by misfortune, do not talk #german and the #english version said *algo entirely distinct of the #portuguese version regarding the amendment *nº 31.
Without embargo, services *me have informed -and confirm information- that the original text, the #german version is the authentic and, therefore, versions in the tongues will adapt to the #german version, with the consequences that *usted has aimed.
politics of the European Parliament with regard to *Chechenia sees *importunada by the fact that, by part, the western countries have acted of mood that *les has taken to lose the moral authority to condemn *contundentemente errors that *Rusia commits at present in *Chechenia.
All #this, while call "*virtuosa" international community justifies the #russian intervention with the excuse of the fight against terrorism and the International Monetary Bottom subsidises in depth lost power of *Yeltsin, in spite of the *millardos of dollars diverted by the #russian authorities.
Like this, in the year 1994, the #russian army took part to show that *Rusia controlled oil pipelines operative that allowed to export production of the sea *Caspio, not to run the risk of remaining excluded of the big #american game.
By #this ask a political dialogue, demand a political solution and plead also by the application of pressure means to our scope, which means also the freezing of new projects in the frame of *TACIS or denial of help alimentary to *Rusia.
Support the idea that we attend to *Moscú in December with occasion of the elections, as I already have exposed, and that *presionemos to *Moscú and to #all the *Cáucaso to take part in a conference for peace, in the that resolved, in addition to this partial problem, also the problems, since in the *Cáucaso carry out bellicose actions in half dozen of countries and extension threat of #the same is quite evident.
The representative of the Council has said this morning that the agreement of *Berlín is game point in these negotiations, but has said, to time, that agriculture #can constitute a grave problem, and believe that *Europa has to be more offensive in this subject.
did not want to *yo that the century *XXI was also marked by a crisis of humanism because trade, money, #would prevail on development of man, on the fundamental values that constitute life of man.

*Sir *Brittan, in point it is necessary to consider *prioritaria the protection of consumer and #this is not a juridical question, but that the juridical question has to subordinate to the protection of consumer and to prevention in favour of citizens.
It that *me irritates also to a large extent is that precisely States members that have the mouth full of the word subsidiariness have put the greater hit to allow it to States members that say: listens, is not the only half but do not leaves to be a half that we want to apply for the creation of more employment.

#If in the context of this fundamental subject of values, of this debate, presents #one *Europa like the that claimed in occasion *Václav *Havel in front of this Assembly, also will be able to go back to obtain the approval of citizens, that do not wish only #one *Europa of the markets.
Considers the current institutional frame in that it assent the Commission -the principle of parity, of equality of States members- like principle *estructurador and historical of the Union or adheres to the most recent motivations that incite to a hasty and urgent review?
interrogations of *les displaced made by representatives of verification mission of the *OSCE and by Nations Joined, and also national interrogations, like the made by the federal Army German in refugee camps, reveal picture *pavoroso of massive shootings, rapes, *saqueos and systematic destruction of houses and properties of the *albanokosovares.

Also #would have to expand the list of the exceptions of retractation right, especially regarding credits *hipotecarios and to agreements, that have effected with a wide notarial advice, like the that it already has mentioned Mrs. speaker.
In conclusion, also *me cheer that the Treaty of *Amsterdam have gone in in vigour three days ago and that the European Commission have of powers wider to take fulfil legislation in the field of consumers taking special upsetting in the protection of the human health.
*Me seems well that it suppress the right of reflection *cuando have a sufficient information, and *me seems timely allusion to the principle of honesty in transactions, that *yo #would relate with the more *señero, older, of the fine faith in the civil Right.

Gentleman President, going back on question relative to the possible utilisation of uranium impoverished in Serbian and *Kosovo, directed a specific question so that it was included in question Turn, a specific question, no a general question, as on the that treated yesterday President in exercise of the Council.
*Yo have to recognise that *me had forgotten completely that it went to celebrate this solemn session, and therefore it that am, to personal title, to the Assembly has not happened by any political sieve, and *le #can say that the evaluation that *yo #can take in these moments is that it #would go back to *votarles, so much to *usted as to Mr. *Hänsch.
Yesterday, in the debate that celebrate, neither #can put brake to the multiple crimes of war, crimes against humanity, and Parliament transformed, with the resolutions, with the debate, with interventions of the Council and of the Commission, in a washing machine of crimes!
The Treaty of *Amsterdam has gone in in vigour only takes #one #few days and have to accumulate still experiences with *él as already now, in the wide debate on the future development and configuration of the European Union, sees every time with greater clarity that beside the European Parliament have to include also to the national Parliaments and spectrum it wider possible of social groups.
Is true that the European Union will have to exert a very important paper in this sense, and *ello already from reconstruction stage, in the that the Commission - beside the World-wide Bank - will have coordination function.
Why country of the *G7 has to present his own plan of reduction?Why leave to partners - and mainly #american - organise by *nosotros the external representation of the Community in the field of the euro, without giving *salia to the decision of the European Council of *Viena?
The principle of the *colegialidad of the political decisions *me seems indispensable, today the same that yesterday, for the own legitimacy of the Commission and of the institutional system European, without that *ello have to without embargo conduct to a fault of individual responsibility in #some situations in the that the decisions are not - and #can not - be collegiate.
The ambition manifested by Mr. *Prodi regarding the political authority that wishes to exert with colleagues and the European Parliament is an excellent *augurio and take votes so that European convinced succeed, appreciating also to Mr. *Santer it that has taken in the course of mandate.

Is that there #be not in *Yugoslavia or in Serbian million of innocent, million of just, that allow to stop stage of bombardments, of the shatter of infrastructures generalised and the collateral damages and happen to a political solution after punishment that received, no only diet of *Milosevic, but the population in general?
Go to give a small example to the *respecto: *cuando the week happened the Council urged to the Commission so that it presented a proposal for the start of negotiations of association with *Albania and *Macedonia, *nos advance among 10 and 20 years, as under some normal circumstances #this #would be *algo on it that #would have thought at least in ten years.
In it that to the financial prevention refers, already have indicated that *nos remain underneath of the upper limit of the own resources, is to say, that have a very considerable *margen of financial performance of the 0, 14 % of the gross social product of the Union for unforeseen costs.
With postponement of reform in the dairy sector until finals of the period 2000-2006, only have displaced the costs of reform to the following period of finance but do not surpass disequilibriums of the market.
President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, #can have taken -assuming like this an influential paper and balanced, and in consequence, decisive for the future work of the Commission- a call to parts so that, in name of the «#european soul», cease immediately the ethnic massacres and bombardments.
Of here that it result necessary to establish a new system of wages and repayments in the that repayment of costs go accompanied of the presentation of the bill and payment remain conditioned to the signature by deputy of a statement in the that appear that costs have made in the exert of mandate.
Lady Speaker, the World-wide Organisation of Trade has fixed for 13 May next the date *tope so that Europeans raise the embargo that *ellos have imposed to the imports of #american meat treated like hormones and mainly the *STB.

For the economic and social cohesion and, in consequence, for the core of the social model European, is of existential importance that have reached to conclude to time the new regulation before finalising the electoral period to the European Parliament.
Said of mood, Parliament, that represents to #european citizens, has pronounced by our agricultural model European, by a greater equity, by a rural development balanced, by a greater quality, by the protection of the environment, as it gave off of the report *Cunha.
Like this as, *permítame, gentleman President, *plantearme a question: in this context, #which is the future of the rural world with development of the Structural Bottoms for the urban world, with the new negotiations of the *OMC and with #one *PAC that goes against of the European Union?
Gentleman President, first of all, today have to be conscious of responsibilities here in the last partial period of sessions of Parliament, no only of our legislative function, but also of commitment to provide this new round of #european bottoms to our regions and local communities punctually.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, like speaker for the *ISPA, the instrument of *preadhesión for the countries of enlargement and like person that has followed continuously the general reform of the structural Bottoms, am really happy that Parliament conclude with hit this week negotiations on Diary 2000.
Anyway, today get at the end of the agricultural reform contained in Diary 2000 and *yo wanted to express my critical support to reform that partially has gone losing his common #european approach and *desfigurándose before east pretences or that Been member.
Only that no #everything is perfect and a new advance of decisions of the Council *me concerns and *me seems inadmissible, mainly pretend introduce in the viticultural zone to new States members that have not been traditionally producers of wine: *Irlanda, *Dinamarca and *Suecia. This decision, to be applied, #would put in doubt commitment regarding bottom, the spirit by the that have got to an agreement.
In front of a situation of this type, had in principle two possibilities. A rigid and increasing control of offer to take of #the same the central element of the Common Agricultural Politics or well adapt politics of mood that #can attend new markets of additional sales.
In *Berlín have given also an important step to sustainability of agriculture as we have reached to include more acutely the environmental looks in market politics and in politics for development of the rural areas.
*Segunda: in opinion of the Commission, intervention shopping to some upper prices in the sector of meat of *vacuno #would conduct to training of new *excedentes no *vendibles and #would exert a considerable pressure on the budget #as well as on market prices.
The financial forecasts for the period 2000-2006 and the agreement *interinstitucional on the budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure constitute an essential part of the package of Diary 2000.
Regarding the administrative cost, the agreement #would allow finance of some 1.000 new places for the community institutions, and fund also the new Statute of Deputies to the European Parliament, although it still do not discerns a solution to this subject, as *ustedes know.
Nevertheless, of article 7 of the Protocol of *Schengen, deduces only that the Council has to adopt concrete disposals relative to integration of the secretariat of *Schengen in the General Secretariat of the Council, is to say, functions of the secretariat of *Schengen and no necessarily personnel.
By causes that come to the case, publications of press also in day of today, want to indicate that the General Secretariat of the Council is not responsible of tensions that at present exist in #the same but that the only cause of said tensions is a political decision of the Council that is protected by the Treaty.
Of course, childbirth of the fact that the Commission will use data so evident of a report of the Court of Accounts to defend with the maximum energy the interests of the European Union.
In the 55ª meeting of the Commission of Human Rights celebrated of the 23-3 to the 30-4-1999 in Gin, the European Union presented resolution project by the that it demands to the *Iraq that cooperate with the pertinent international organisations and that communicate #whereabouts or destination of persons that follow disappeared.
Having #this in account, #would be interesting to know #which are the plans of the Council to achieve a participation balanced of men and women in the future Commission, and how opinion *le deserves to the Council the idea to appoint to member of the Commission that commission exclusively of equality of opportunities among men and women.
Believe that the subject of the right of employees to call attention on irregularities and to take criticise public is not an internal subject related with the determination of charges #etcetera, but that it is principle subject, on transparency.
In general lines, are in favour of reform, without embargo, have to express #some reservations with regard to the grey zones that present looks that have not deepened still as, for example, the impact in the regions that, in virtue of the principle of concentration, will suffer paralysis in development process.
*Me ask #if *ustedes do not have a *tercer model, that *yo #would designate «agricultural model Austrian». Austrian, because in front of the North American #wagnerian productions, #would exist operetta agriculture»: agriculturalists #would protect the landscape, nature, the environment, so that *Sisí #can give walk the weekends.
To allow the operation of the inner market and integration, #among others looks, of the free trade of the alimentary products like element more of #the same, is fundamental that in the countries candidates respect norms that has established the EU in matter of hygiene and health.
The results in regulation of intervention measures in the sector of fishing #can be considered like satisfactory graces, precisely, to attitude of Fishing Commission that, from the *primer moment, *opuso to the initial design of the Commission.
The fact that we are to spend more money in the *Europa rural, to the that joins data that every time it is lower the number of persons related with agriculture, guarantees a level of minimum life for agriculturalists during the next seven years.
#If well my region has reached to keep inside the Goal 1, #this is not more that a Goal 1 of transitory character, since money amount that has received with arrangement to this goal is minor that quantity *per *cápita that perceived during the last program.
#would Wish also take state my gratitude to the salient Commission because, in the *fragor of the debates, nobody has stopped to think in members of the Commission that have developed an arduous work in favour of the #european citizens, these same citizens to the that represent.
As I already have said in reiterated occasions, the greater part of the projects of rural development #can not succeed without the fundamental business activity, the agricultural activity, since these projects do not advance by himself\/hisself alone.
Had account that consumption has descended *vertiginosamente and that the countries have increased confidence in the own production without resorting to import, the collapse of the #russian economy has not taken more that weaken a market already of by himself\/hisself fragile.
Is by reason that in #some moments the European Parliament has felt the need of *radicalizar position getting even to block the process of taking of decisions with regard to finance of the Committees to *través of the community budget.
This guarantee *reviste a big importance, since it is the principle on the that will insist and, in case that it did not get to an agreement on this question, #can *comunicarle to the Council that, one after the other, #all the procedures of *codecisión will get to the conciliation stage and that, #one and time, will pose difficulties to this problem.
The most important of *ellos is enlargement of the field of the regulation to modalities of atypical work, like rent employment or work to distance, that have increased *vertiginosamente in the last time.
The opinions of the Commissions of External Subjects and of Development and of Cooperation insist in the need to deepen and improve conditions for development, the same that the Commission *REX, that goes back to insist on *ello in section of this report.

Gentleman President, *Señorías, association Agreement economic, *concertación political and cooperation that today subjects to ratification of Parliament constitutes an essential stage in the ambitious route that initiate takes already four years to establish a new relation with *México to the height of ambitions.

#All share pretty much with #all heart the goal to establish a politics of human refugees, without embargo, have the feeling of that democracy «finds better protected in the pockets of citizens», using a #danish expression.
To avert that the #european citizens remain excluded of these new technologies of information no only is indispensable that training in new technologies give from the first stages of education, but that adopt suitable measures in the field of training along #all life.
Gentleman President, when taking the word by last time in name of the Popular Party European giving answer to Mr. *Barzanti, the one who has taken previously the word in name of the Socialist Group European, #can not by less to say, in an alone sentence, it that believe that we are #many in feeling, and is that *le go to throw a lot of less.
To Mr. *Samland, that has used a no juridical argument but politician, *yo *le #would remember that this Assembly has asked many times to the Council that abandon unanimities and the qualified majorities to go to adopt the agreements by majority.
credits for commitments proposed for the structural actions are satisfied to the decision of the European Council; #this elevate to 32, 678 *millardos of euros, delivered among the structural Bottoms (30 *millardos) and Cohesion Bottom (2, 6 *millardos of euros), it that represents an effective decrease of the 7 % regarding 1999, is to say: a lot, and, in measure, too much.
How #can say of the consistent budgetary initiative in fixing cost goal in place of a maximum limit of costs, in looking for at all costs projects to spend credits approved in place to assign credits to the existent projects?
Besides, #can surprise the fact that during negotiations have sacrificed the Goal 2, allocated to the industrial and rural regions in roads of economic restructuring, to the Goals 1 and 3: endowment, for the period 1999-2006, will be of 22, 5 *millardos of *ecus, figure pretty much similar to the of the period 1994-1999.
The fact that the committees work in opening frame and of transparency means progress, but *apartarlos of the national realities in the exercise of function, for *situarlos under the authority of the Commission, constitutes deviation that refuse.
So that it was accepted the result of the referendum on autonomy for *Timor Oriental, foreseen for 8 August with backrest of Nations Joined, the plebiscite will have to celebrate in some conditions of justice and freedom that #can not entrust in that it guarantee army #indonesian.
agreement is the culmination of fifteen years of diplomatic management and produces *veintitrés years after annexation by strength of this ancient #portuguese colony in the that died hundreds of thousands of persons, victims of the civil war and of the brutal repression of army #indonesian.
And take votes so that #all the that they continue have happiness to celebrate the next month of September a big victory of village *timorense, by the expression of his free will to decide his own future in the referendum that will celebrate the next day 8 August.
Expect that after *tantos years of suffering, reestablish finally the legality, that finally the right of self-determination also was a fact and that the perspective of the referendum give a true opportunity to democracy, in place to increase violence, #such as *sucede in this moment in varied zones of Indonesian.
Exists a majority of 101 countries of the 190 that form the international community -and no treats of a theoretical majority, since the Treaties approved and the constitutional modifications carried out by numerous countries like this show it-, that are favourable to the establishment of a universal moratorium.
#If today *les explain #this is for *decirles that my eyes will not go back to dampen , but that emotion *perdurará until we have reached this moratorium, until we have reached to abandon roads of the past, roads of barbarism and advance by the path of the future and of the *humanización.
This weakness is not related only with *Ocalan, but with the *importantísima question of the human rights and of citizens for #all Turkish, and especially, for the big minority *kurda of *Turquía. did not recognises identity, tongue, education, his political expression.

In concrete, from 1 January 2001 will dispense to small and medium enterprise to present five variables, although States members will conserve faculty to request the variable «conditions of delivery», «modality of transport» and «statistical diet» to companies that surpass a true threshold.

The organisation of the market of potato starch is closely related with the of grain. With reason starch producers of potato operate, in big part, in market that industry of grain starch.

#Some countries in roads of development that are members of the *OMC #would be in fact interested in reforming the agreement of the textile industry and of preparation to accelerate liberalisation of #all the quantitative restrictions that it will have to complete in date so next like 1 January of the year 2005.
treats to ask a positive action by part of the Commission to ensure that the practices of international trade in relation with products derived of the textile industry have a suitable treatment.
Gentleman President, since #this is the last session of the term of office in the that *Finlandia has converted in member of plenary right of the European Union, #would wish, as faithful *contertulio that I am of this group of Fridays, that also tongue *finesa took act of presence in the literal record of the last partial period of sessions.

By #this, want to express gratitude to our political friends of the Christian Democrat Union (*CDU) and the Christian Social Union (*CSU) and also to the Liberal by the firm support *solidario that have offered to the Presidency of the Council.
The #european Commissioner German designated *Verheugen manifested after Colony Summit that the fast agreement to strengthen the External Politics and of Common Security of the Union hardly #would have been possible without war of *Kosovo.

By it that refers to this last, war of *Kosovo *nos remembers it founded of the criteria of *Copenhague, that take of respect of the human rights and of minorities a previous condition for #all the countries candidates to adhesion to the European Union.

To measure that go happening days, have increasingly the worrisome feeling of that the capacity to take war surpasses with a lot the capacity to coordinate reconstruction of the devastation that has suffered life of the populations.
Some that aggravated by the crisis of confidence caused by the *descrédito of the Commission, exists a democratic deficit that affects to Parliament, exists an abysmal distance among Parliament and the daily problems of the #european populations.
Of course, #some have expressed -truth, gentleman *Cox?- some weigh when seeing to ancient Commissioners present in his Commission, but *eso shows that maybe Mr. *Cox, leaving carry by controversy wish, had not read well the ancient report of experts, that precisely absolved very clearly to Commissioners.
Go to back to his Commission and to those who doubt of independence, gentleman President, alleging that has *demasiados socialist Commissioners *les will answer that, *cuando was designated *usted by a majority of socialist Governments and *socialdemócratas, the Group that felt more surprised by his first public statements was precisely the Socialist Group.
Is on *nosotros and collaboration that *reposará the possibility to go out of the current crisis that has been so deep that has reduced to minimum percentages in the political history European number of #that that went to vote in the last elections.
#can not but *extrañarme of the attempt of right group of Parliament of *prorrogar the nomination of the Commission demanding a report on the case, report that will be drafted by a group of neutral experts.
Apart from considerations, candidate to the Presidency of the Commission, Mr. Roman *Prodi, has shown before the constructive and creative spirit with the that conceives the contribution of the Commission to the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
Lady Speaker, *Finlandia, with the big experience of having survived peacefully in difficult conditions, with difficult neighbours, is the ideal country to head efforts, that today take urgent, for reconstruction of the *Balcanes, and, in fact, president *Aatisaari has contributed already to the process decisively.
It same #can say of the question of the code of behaviour for the high charges, because in the Commission, along the last years, the management definitely has relaxed regarding internal organisation, #such as it underlined the report of the wise men.
Only #can *especular on until how point had engaged Mr. *Bangemann with game norms just in look of the inner market *cuando is to sell knowledges to #Telephone, important operator in the European Union and further.
The Council highlighted especially the need to clear in brief the question of deep form and impartial, #as well as the possibility to reform the current legislation in case to be necessary.
The Council took #all the ordinary procedures on taking of decisions to guarantee a fast explanation of the proposals of the Commission, with seen to finish work, always that it was possible, before finals of the present year, as it has proposed the Council.

This week, the Commission has issued a formal statutory decision against the local organisers of tournament of Glass of football World celebrated the past year in *Francia.
Besides, is important to add that the *imposición of a more elevated fine to the organisers of Glass of the World of 1998 in *Francia #would have forced to the Commission to pose undertake action against the organisers of previous important tournaments, that used exactly sale politics of entrances.
Already have begun to observe norms, establishing the precedent, and in #all the future occasions, #that will be mood to manage the subjects in the European Union.
Lady Speaker, the second inform elaborated by the independent experts that *nos finishes to remit is remarkable by the importance and the quality of work made in so #few months and also by the will to describe with frankness the bad internal operation of the Commission.
#Can take #all the #european directives, #all the recommendations, #all the laws that want: #if inspections do not guarantee application, believe that the deep doubt of our *conciudadanos on the #european efficiency, #as well as on the interest of norms, #can increase .
Have proposed pair and #one of delights to make a *primer speech in this Assembly is that #one has feeling that these words go to be studied according to merit and no simply judged by the background of the political party.
In the long process of gestation of the Commission of #millenium, get to the decisive moment: investiture, with the democratic legitimacy that *nos have given the recent #european elections to the European Parliament.
Like conclusion of the process, have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission in spite of reservations that keep in relation with Palace Mrs., #whose innocence boast, but #whose conception of the political responsibility in a subject that concerns to the community budget do not share.
appearances of the Commission in Parliament have not been at all an useless act or a vain representation, but absolutely essential and *usted same *nos has affirmed aptly the past week, that in any #another parliament the executive organ has to give explanation detailed #any.
But #if well no *le give neither bounced cheque neither a cheque in white, *le communicate our will to work in common to give to #all villages of *Europa, in spite of difficulties and of conflicts, reasons to believe in his own destination and entrust in his common future.
As, for example, a clean atmosphere and drinkable water, safe foods, that do not poison to persons, or, for example, the protection of his economic interests workforces or also, for example, the definition of some basic norms in matter of health in the European Union.
Gentleman President, the right to give the approval to the Commission goes implicitly to pair with the duty of Parliament to verify aptitude of the future commissioners to exert mandate.
Go to begin with a general observation: #if the level of requirement applied to evaluate qualification of Commissioners went the that showed the colleague *Ingo #Friedrich in audiences and that also has manifested in the debate of today, #any *nos #would pose difficulties.
#Both kept a debate of *primer order in the commission and offered an authentic demonstration no only of his technical qualification, but also -it that it is almost more important- of the new political culture to the that *usted same has referred, gentleman Commissioner, and of dialogue among the European Parliament and the Commission.
Bear satisfy, that Mr. *Busquin have not shown the lower sensitivity, by not talking already of commitment to defend the use of Dutch in the #european institutions, supposes an insult for six millions of #flemish.
Want that elements include in agreement on the operation among the Commission and Parliament, because the number of abstentions or of votes against in the final vote of morning on the Commission will depend of advances that produce of here to morning in it that to elements refers.
Without embargo, in citizens, in the #european villages has remained an impression of fragility, by not saying of impotence; an impression of worrisome weakness precisely in front of a crucial question, in front of the question on the that arose *Europa: guarantee peace in our continent.
*Usted has signalled precisely like *primer goal enlargement of the Union to the countries that are prepared and afterwards has staggered cooperation forms drawing concentric circles of virtual participation with the nearest countries but no prepared still for entry.
And in the case *Dessault-*Augusta has remained among so much very clear that *él was to the common of the existence of box *B. *Yo *me ask: #who *nos guarantees that in the future no have boxes *B in the Commission, in the *DG *XII or where was, #if this subject do not resolves of way more suitable that up to now?
The *presupuestación based in activity, cast restricted of assignments, responsibility in the bureaucratic device, the effective control of the economic traffic #as well as emphasis in the economic responsibility demand without embargo work.
In my opinion in the so mentioned assignments pertaining to Section 4 there #be without embargo an increase in comparison with the budget of the past year and on the other hand, under Section 4, there #be besides points in the that they have not made cuts at all.
Regarding orientation on the new agreements *interinstitucionales and other different instruments for the references so much of *Wynn as of *Bourlanges, warn that the Council thinks that it is possible finance of reservation for *Kosovo with a new orientation or trip of bottoms, but with security also the Council will respect the agreement *interinstitucional and #all points.
Lady Speaker, Mr. *Galeote took intervention out of place because no treated of censorship motion to person but of investiture debate of Mr. *Prodi, and criticised it that *yo had said of Palace Mrs..
Of compliance with the agenda, the Presidency of the Council -hail to Speaker in exercise, lady. *Halonen- and of the Commission proceed to take *sendas statements on the preparatory works of the meeting of the European Council the next days 15 and 16 October in *Tampere.
As it is natural, expect that in the field of the judicial cooperation remain guaranteed the juridical security of citizens to time that implants a fast and effective system of police persecution *transfronterizo. Is to say, agile procedures, immediate exchange of documents, harmonisation of the penal Right and help for the victims.
On the other hand, #can not lose of sight that the European Union has experienced an evolutionary process that has ended in the creation of a juridical order European and some #european institutions endowed of a series of competitions.
Other important questions are integration politics that affect also to the cultural rights of minorities, the right to live in family with dignity and the political rights for #all citizens that reside in *Europa.
The *JSA, authority *fiscalizadora, has directed hard criticisms against of the bad use given to data, to the deficient information to refugees on rights and to that the same authority has not had access to the register of suitable way.
*Conque leave to separate to mothers of children, to withdraw residence permission to worker that has lost employment and to violate asylum right.
Swims more far of the truth. Only had luck that thanks to intervention of NATO and to the return of the *albano-#Kosovar and eagerness to initiate what before reconstruction of country, refugee flow dissolved ahead of time.
The Council of General Subjects approved the day before yesterday measures of the European Union directed to relieve the situation of the island and decided to forbid export to #the same of arms, ammunitions and armament type that #can be used in acts of terror and repression.
*Cuando results that the Commission hardly is of the gravest crisis of history and the European Union in group has reasons for *meditar on alarm signal without precedents that finish of *dirigirle millions of constituents and constituents, moment loaned so that they adopted #some measures that #can open new perspectives, to measure that took *renacer hope.
Thus, the Basque Country keeps a political conflict with the #spanish State that has given place to demonstrations of violent type, violence that refuse the majority of *nosotros, but that has seeded and left a trail of deaths, wounds, pain, extortion, fear and victims innocent.
By #a lot of that the resolution approved have to consider like commission list that entrusts to the Commission *Prodi -that do not has support- #can not *aprobarla, because in *ella the fundamental requests that formulates Parliament to administration in functions of the EU remain reflected for ever, as #if of eternal truths treated.
Mr. *Prodi, so much by fidelity to the principles that gave life to the current European Union as by management capacity tested, am safe that goes to conduct to the new Commission by the path and to rhythm that the current circumstances require.
Thus, further of the individual questions that *atañen to #some Commissioners and that, anyway, belong to the past, have given my vote of confidence, to the new Commission, in the *convencimiento, besides, that Parliament has of the necessary mechanisms to revoke confidence marry to be betrayed.
By reasons, and had account of the generally recognised competition to Commissioners and of the will manifested by the majority of *ellos to work in narrow collaboration with Parliament, have voted in favour of the investiture of the European Commission.
So much reconstruction of *Kosovo like the humanitarian help for northwest of *Turquía, after catastrophes that have produced there, do not admit more delay. Is the moral obligation of the European Union have the necessary financial means.
#If, in the case of *Kosovo, was not necessary to ask permission to the Security Council neither expect to the consent of *Milosevic, ?why in the case of *Timor Oriental is necessary to expect permission of the Security Council and obtain the consent of Mr. *Habibie?
Gentleman President, from the #dutch link with Indonesian, in the first place want to say that *me has amazed to a large extent that in the international juridical order and maintenance by part of the Security Council, the world-wide order have shown, again, so extraordinarily #naïve.
In the west do not collect a resolution of Nations Joined to bomb the #ex *Yugoslavia owing to *Kosovo, that still follows being part of *Yugoslavia, and without embargo up to now have not achieved *decidirnos, by reasons that are, to launch a military intervention in name of the inhabitants of *Timor.
In this perspective, to initiative of the Council or of States members, the Commission of Human Rights of Nations Joined has adopted during the three last varied years resolutions that *preconizan the universal abolition of pity capital.
Subject: reciprocal Suppression of the compulsory visa among the European Union and countries In determined States members of the European Union, has suppressed the compulsory visa for the American citizens that travel to countries members of the Union.
time that the Commission have presented proposal on these regulations, the Council will consider, following the principle of reciprocity, the countries that will be *exentos of visa in States members of the European Union.
Without embargo, want to indicate that the Ministry of External Subjects of States Joined has declared that the competent organ of program *Attorney General yes has accepted to #Grecia as participant, but that it is necessary to expect the definite processing so that citizens #greek #can go to States Joined without visa.
The Union underlined to the principle of negotiations, on 31 March 1998, that the transitory periods that concede do not have to affect to norms of the Union neither to politics or to the normal operation of #the same.
The concrete question that take is #if the Council do not thinks that *le #can offer to *Marruecos the possibility to take a more rational procedure, because build a nuclear head office to produce 600 *Mw of electricity is "to kill flies to *cañonazos" and believe that it #would be convenient that neighbours did not take it.
The report of Mrs. *Pack that are today, with the amendment *nº 2, already takes quotation to collaboration with the *albanokosovares that are desirous to reconstruct state and *les has to help to take part in projects of the European Union and loan contribution to #the same.
Gentleman President, is very positive the fact that Parliament involve for the first time in this subject, has competition *jurisdiccional and, especially by means of the delegation *interparlamentaria, #can take follow-up of the operation of service, that, of course, has to organise also the execution of accompaniment measures for *reinstalar to refugees.

Mrs. *Morgantini has elaborated an excellent report that has my support and the of my Group, and the two amendments are very important, because they ask an annual report and access to places, #as well as information on looks of finance.
In effect, deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of Nations are favourable to #one *Europa able to boost coordination among the different States members, more that to #one *Europa bureaucratic that *preconice a strict regulation and no adapted to diversities of the geographic and cultural situations.
In the juridical plane, wish to remember that paper of the European Parliament consists in adapting to the current juridical foundations and that did not has to, in any case, create #one new, no according to the Treaties signed by the governments of States members.
In the resolution proposal appear collected, #among others points, a wish of *traspasar the police collaboration of the *tercer to the *primer *pilar, a wish to award operative competitions to the *Europol and a call to the creation of a Fiscal Ministry common European (*Corpus *Juris).
Besides, is not casual that the already limited extension competition of the Court of Justice in the questions that *atañen to justice and to the internal subjects excepts on purpose the subjects related with the public order and security.
The Assembly will know perfectly the sophisticated aptitudes of the international criminals to take advantage of of the different legal disposals and statutory all over the world and infiltrate in the economic and financial systems without repairing in the national borders.
Is incredible that the Central Bank have debugged help conceded to #the same by the International Monetary Bottom through paper corporations that has in the fiscal paradise of Jumper island.
foods are in the #russian shops, and of mood ruins value of the agricultural production and of the #russian foods #as well as the possibilities of agriculturalists, and engages his own production.
Have to take all it that was in hand to turn off fire there unchained, so that persons of part of the world have the possibility to develop autonomies peacefully and have a future as we have reached already in *Europa.
Without embargo, expect that president #can take out strengths of the massive support that received in urns and that act so that the revolutionary court cancel death penalties and like this will Go #can continue reform path and of construction of the civil society.
Varied States members contribute in the mission of the 90 military observers of Nations Joined that are deployed in capitals of the region and in the general barracks of the rebellious groups with the end to supervise fulfillment of the Agreement of *Lusaka.
Of course, also #would agree with the call that, #among others, has taken Mrs. *Maes in favour of the strict suspension of the traffic of arms that follows feeding conflict in the region and that often has origin here in the European Union.
The Group of the European Party of Liberal, Democrat and Reformers requests that it do not include a statement of the relative Commission to the refusal of the #french Government to raise the embargo of meat of *vacuno #british.
*Cuando takes months asked to the representatives of the Commission in the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer on information relative to the illegal recycling of muds *cloacales in *piensos for animals in #some States members, nobody #can *decirme it that it was mud *cloacal, where was or why.

The loss of youngsters in flower of life is *devastadora for the economic development and productivity, education, agriculture and a pile of socioeconomic spheres.
Believe that the question of obligations to this *respecto and his moral slope #can take that it progress the debate or also that it #can see this debate to the light of the concept of *condicionalidad, of the that do not refuse to take use in regard to these very poor countries that have need of collaboration and help.

The Commission and Parliament share the common goal to increase until the 12% the corresponding part to the renewable energies in the gross consumption of energy inside the Community until the year 2010.
The energetic politics elaborates, in effect, with bottom curtain: want to protect the environment, want to reduce CO2 and, therefore, have to consider, in particular, #if liberalisation of the #european market of electricity, #such as it is in these moments in #some States members, no results *contraproducente.
utilisation of sources of renewable energy constitutes development model and application of the most modern technologies, that at the same time also contribute to the protection of the environment, but also has #one *segunda facet.
treats of *algo that support clearly in the Socialist Group, but am not of the all safe that commitment go accompanied of the political resources -that it is #one of reasons by the that ask that the campaign encourage and boost the renewable energy- or -it that it is more important- of the financial resources.
Of form in that *Pretoria #can receive to preferences *arancelarias conceded by the European Union, #would have to offer facilities to neighbours, since the economic development is indispensable to guarantee the political stability and peace in the region.
The #south african preference of game had relation with a near agreement to disposals of the Agreement of *Lomé and the *CNUCED predicts an uneven impact on the currents of bilateral exchanges in detriment of the #south african products.
Gentleman President, like representative of an agricultural country as *Francia, and more still a country that has linked name and politics to a true concept of cooperation with *África, #can not go in sense that Mrs. *Kinnock and approve the called agreement of trade and cooperation with the #South african Republic, by reasons of form and of bottom.
In our case, in the #italian case, #the same happen by some commissions ascribed, for example, to the Ministry of Industry and to the *cuales, in spite of work that make in the commissions, hardly #can have access, so as to reach that bottoms assign to States members in measure every time greater.
Only want to remember that the cultural revolution demands time period longer: in this case, it only that have taken is to change #some places that was of vital importance change because it was necessary to give mobility example by countries and by persons; it was necessary to show that charges are not *vitalicios for nobody.
Am fully in accordance with points that has mentioned: the reduction of taxes that tax societies and harmonisation are very useful for the #european competition, to the equal that tax on performances of work.
My question has relation with the humanitarian help in valley of the *Panshir, is to say, in the zone controlled by resistance to the totalitarian and criminal diet of *Kabul and of the Talibans, of the *cual knows too much the appalling destination that reserve to women.

The past year, more of half of the total imports of *Turquía proceeded of the European Union, and almost half of the total of exports of *Turquía in year directed to the European Union.
First: had to especially to the initiative of minister #greek of External Subjects, to the one who want to express here my recognition- has reached relation much better -#if well still no optimum- among *Turquía and country member, #Grecia, having given also a step to the solution of the so important #cypriot question.

Without embargo, the internal development of these countries and, especially, capacity to fulfil the requirements of the Union, to enjoy also of rights in #the same, do not adapt to adhesion term so fast like the that *ellos wish.
*Europa, for *nosotros, the liberal democrats, has to follow backing firmly the peace process and of cooperation in Orient Next, although it has to engage , besides that from the point of economic sight, also in political and cultural terms purchasing size and a political weight recognised in the region and in the world.
In the #french text and in the #english text says that "it asks to the religious authorities that cooperate without reservations" - it that, already from the point of lexical sight, differs of the #italian text - but especially "that they take part in the distribution of condoms" .

Now well, #if well we believe necessary associate *Turquía to the Union to avert #one derives *islamita in this country, also believe that his pure and simple integration to the current structures of the Union, like the European Parliament finishes to request, is impossible.
During decades the #turkish state has pursued to village *kurdo and *le has denied the obvious right of minorities to his political rights, social and cultural #as well as the right to his own language, to his own schools and to his own culture.
An important part of development of the principle of competition is liberalisation of the international trade, that in our opinion will not be complete until the *OMC #can take part in the elimination of obstacles and *tergiversaciones commercial created by private companies.
In our position -and the Presidency of the Council finishes, with reason, to remember it--, exists first of all worry that the Union no enclose in a sectorial negotiation, inscribed in the conclusions of the Cycle of *Uruguay, limited to agriculture and services.
#This is especially appeal to the Council so that it find a uniform #european position and concede to the Commission the full confidence *otorgándole to time a general mandate of negotiation, clearing to time the formal participation of Parliament.
It less that #can say is that these statistics do not endorse totally the idea according to the *cual the progressive dismantlement of obstacles to exchanges, after eight cycles of negotiations (from the beginning of the decade of the years 50 until 1994), favoured the economic growth.
hormones in beefs are not the most recommended recipe; the elimination of barriers #can not carry achieve the elimination of security and of the quality of products.
The situation in the agricultural fields and *agroalimentario has aggravated from takes #some years, *cuando theoretically were protected by the cycle of *Uruguay and the agreements of *Marrakech, that supposed guaranteed and organise access to the markets, helps to exports and the internal helps.
The result of #this is that, in this moment, the European Community is to an international organism the compulsory solution of his international controversies without having the guarantee that it have sufficient impartiality.
Believe that in the case of the economy is not necessary, still *cuando no treat of an exact science, since the majority of economists consider, by reasons that have indicated takes moment, that liberalisation of exchanges goes by good path.

Obviously there #be *incumplimientos, there are delays of more of four months in list communications, there #be more ships that before -among a 57% and a 63%, more in *Irlanda and in *Inglaterra- *cuando had to have less, there are damages to ecosystem, there are damages to the economy of persons and no are the recommendations of the *ICCAT.
Gentleman President, like Mr. deputy knows, so much in the preferential deal in the commercial relations as in the granting of bottoms *PHARE and in the subjects related with the agreements will apply the regional approaches foreseen by the European Union foreseen for the *Sudeste of *Europa.

#This do not has to suppose at all an increase of the public cost in *Europa, but demands that State, #all the #european States are had to transfer to the Union the corresponding resources to transfer in fact of competitions.
During this long and intense month of transactions, Parliament encouraged in taking see to the Council that no only of *FEOGA and structural Bottoms lives the Union, and that the remaining 20% of the budget also served to the goals of the Union and that, often, affected to subjects very sensitive politically.
In consequence, reasons to approve or refuse the Budget only #can base in grade in that the definition of the central axes of the political answer to the own approaches and in #if the endowment of financial resources for said political is sufficient.
In a world *cambiante, have to be in conditions to undertake adjust of the budget much more quickly, so that without increasing the global budget #can answer to new needs, for example and very especially, to development of the new countries members of *Europa Oriental, but also to the humanitarian help in cases of catastrophe and to reconstruction of the *Balcanes, that do not have to be funded with reductions in help to the *tercer world.
The new Commission proposes to apply the different criteria that *ustedes have gone back to expose for adjudication and supervision of works hired with offices of technical assistance, so as to determine clearly of how looks will have to commission the public administration and #which will be able to entrust to the offices of technical assistance.
Without embargo, since these visits to #ECB are of character more informal, is not necessary to say that they have to consider like a supplementary instrument of communication among institutions and that #can not consider substitute of the periodic public audiences in the European Parliament.
Try use the monetary politics to increase the real economic activity above his sustainable level will not take but produce in the long run a still greater inflation, no an economic growth faster.
Although the contribution that takes when keeping stability of prices do not has to overlook, the monetary politics clearly #can not resolve the grave structural problem of unemployment in the zone of the euro.
Said coordination #would tend to diminish the democratic responsibility, to reduce transparency of the political frame of face to the public opinion and to increase uncertainty on the sectorial performances, looming potentially with *desestabilizar the economy.
In actuality, the results of payment systems to the by minor *transfronterizos carry a clear delay regarding the political goals of the Economic and Monetary Union and, even, to the expectations of citizens and small #european companies.
After the introduction of notes and coins of euros on 1 January 2002, differences regarding service levels of the national payments and *transfronterizos inside the zone of coin only will take even more evident.
#This shows that #ECB takes seriously responsibility to support other common economic goals, in particular the of employment, and *nosotros know that bonanza circumstantial in the European Union, in spite of the evolution differentiated inside the zone "euro 11" , will follow requiring support.
*Unicamente a total transparency of the report among the goals fixed by the Treaty and actions of members of the Council will allow to Europeans appreciate #if members of the Council fulfil correctly with mission, *algo that *nosotros no doubt.
Gentleman President, nine months after the launching of the euro and blurred enthusiasm by his future paper like the main currency of international reservation owing to the weakness of the types of change, #can not announce to the four winds hit without *calificativos.
Also resulted garbled yesterday listen that Mr. *Issing, economist boss of #ECB, when seeming had declared in *Londres that the Bank #would not publish his economic forecasts for the territory of the euro, perpetuating culture of secret.
Believe that it #would be well that thought in a new system and that #would owe *preguntarnos how #can guarantee a better parliamentary collaboration with a series of countries in roads of development and with the countries of *Europa Central and Oriental, to the that go to help, and do not say it because the *ONG do not go to follow being there, but because I believe that it is an image *algo mistaken the that give of the consolidation of democracy #if we say that only the *ONG #can take part actively.
Gentleman President, visit to the European Parliament produces in moment in the that #all the #colombian population in group has manifested #alto and clear wish of civil peace, of democracy and of respect by the human rights.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate on the report of the European Council and the statement of the relative Commission to the results of the European Council of the past days 15 and 16 October in *Tampere.
Like this takes in the conclusions of the necessary form to attend the legitimate worries of citizens in matter of security and judicial guarantee of rights, as it is norm in a Union that pretends to base in the principle of *prevalencia of the right and of the law.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, Prime minister *Lipponen, *me #one to the vision that the European Council of *Tampere #can be considered historical, due to the fact that it is the first time that the Council has treated and has put in command of the #european diary the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice.
Group adds to the idea of the Council that the Union and States members reinforce the opening of the Union to the rest of the world in the field of the personal relations, cultural, political and economic.
And in this sense, believe that here it opens a new important front and support also -as we have taken with the initiative of Parliament- the creation of refugee bottom, that believe that it #can be a very decisive element.
will Give only an example among the #many that #can give: the priority awarded to cooperation against the juvenile delinquency in cities *nos seems *algo odd and out of place, since for *reprimirla really States #would take better in intensifying cooperation efforts to eradicate delinquency organised that acts increasingly to scale international.
*Me seems also that the Commission, in the new spirit of *Tampere and like watchdog of legislation juridical community, #would have to take fulfil the directives to pursue money bleaching, #whose *incumplimiento is an effective judicial cooperation, as, for example, in the case of *Gibraltar.
But in a more general plane, and in particular *cuando has treated of questions of immigration, the Council has sunk in two contradictions that, by it other, remit, the two, to fault of political value or to the mutual paralysis of members: do not know well.
Without embargo, restructuring #can be intelligent, is to say, #can take into account the social and economic cost; and #can be short of sight, is to say, #can take into account today the economic cost and pay the social cost a lot afterwards, because they are #many factors that go to influence negatively in company that do not takes into account the social dimension.
In front of the new technologies and to the revolution of information, there #be place for a new conception of productivity, based no in rationing of the social costs, but in the promotion of the human capacities.
Then have value to watch of front the reality: employees of *Michelin are not victims of the direction of *Michelin, but of His *Señorías, merchants of the *mundialismo, as also they are it employees of the banking sector, of insurances, of the car sector and #many #others, #whose companies merge, move or restructure to be able to survive.
Yesterday Parliament asked to President *Duisenberg that subjected the monetary politics to growth needs of #one *Europa that do not knows to reform , that do not knows to reform the economies and that neither knows to liberalise the markets, especially work market.
In this frame, *nos find in front of the difficult problem of transfers: difficult, as, obviously, destroy put of work in *Europa; difficult, as #the same that the *vilipendian today demand, simultaneously, that *Europa multiply investments in the countries in roads of development and facilitate to the maximum the entrance in the territory of the European Union of pertinent products of countries.
But, said *eso, the that believe in the market and *militamos in part of the Hemicycle, far of the autarchic temptations of side and #another of the Assembly, believe that the principle of social compensation has to balance the principle of a market that work.
In this document refers, as, "the #european companies consider that they are an inseparable part of society; #this means that they act of a socially responsible way: consider the benefits his main goal, but no the only reason of existence.
Perhaps owe to that fear difficulties in verification and to that the prohibition #can allow to countries like *Corea of the North and *Irak make proofs of low level, or perhaps fear that by means of the permanent cessation of proofs, States Joined #can see *mermados his nuclear arsenal and deterrence strength.
To finalise, wish to support again it that Parliament agreed on 18 November of the past year; supported the statements of the eight States of 9 June 1998, the *new diary *coalition, a definite elimination and total of the nuclear arms.
Gentleman President, want to have hopes in that the decision of the Senate of States Joined is form of *esquivar provisionally the ethical obligation that has the *superpotencia world-wide in front of the world-wide public opinion, like country that has to be *vanguardista in reduction politics of the nuclear danger.
*Muchísimos states have abandoned of voluntary form possession of this type of arms. The great states, that have of nuclear arms, have reduced considerably arsenals of nuclear arms, but #can not be really satisfied with *ello.
Wanted to ask to Commissioner *Patten, #if still *me listens, #if it agrees *conmigo in that #this reinforces the need of an external politics and of effective #european defence, that *nos allow to undertake measures with independence - no already depend, but rather protect security so that it do not see *vapuleada constantly by winds of the national politics American and by the presidential elections of States Joined.
Expect with interest the end of discussion that has announced the speaker of Budget Commission in relation with assignment form of means in chapter To 30 of the budget for the year 2001.
Now that talk of the *Europa of the next century, the new and big *Europa, the *Europa of enlargement, no #would result, perhaps, advantageous launch in this moment, once and for all, a brave cultural politics, since culture is not *algo on it that have to treat of form that treat the purportedly important subjects.
*Permítaseme also observation by it that refers to the amendment 12: this amendment is accepted keeping flexibility to end to be able to approximate, on this concrete point, during the conciliation stage, the positions of the Council and of Parliament.
The Commission accepts the amendment 13, that proposes criteria *indicativos of budgetary distribution among the great cultural spheres, to time that increases of 9% to 11% the percentage in favour of actions in the sector of book and reading, #whose mount annual #would diminish noticeably in comparison with program *Ariane.
The new line affects to the preparatory measures of the audiovisual sector and do not takes reference to section 3 of the ancient article 130, relative to the industrial development and to the decisions in #whose virtue of established program *Eureka Audiovisual.
Is to regret that, like result of the vote of the commission of culture, youth, education, communication and sport, go to present that finance of the Audiovisual Observatory guarantee for only three years, against of posture, in #others, of president of said parliamentary commission, Mr. *Gargani, that presented a report to the *respecto.
Now well, in the budget of the European Parliament, in the *rúbrica 3710, read with surprise the following formulation: "Contributions in favour of the political parties Europeans" , with the following explanation: "The Commission #would have to, it before possible, subject a statute of political parties Europeans" .
The past year, the Court of Justice of the Communities condemned severely the fact to engage budgetary costs without legal base by the Commission, with complicity of the European Parliament.
The countries industrialised, in group, and States members of the Union, in particular, do not owe *desentenderse of help to development, since *ello #would have sanitary repercussions, social, economic and grave politics in the always fragile balance of the most disadvantaged countries.
*Me seems a grave political error that, #if the Council and the Commission have established a system by means of the *cual his own members, Commissioners, Ministers and Bosses of Government of States members, #can be investigated in case of irregularity, #can not be it deputies.
company *Michelin, that finishes to proceed, in *Francia, to a series of controversial dismissals, finds, precisely, in a situation of gender, since his main competitor produces pneumatic in the countries of the East, to coast of wages five times less high.
The truth is that the Managerial frame went in in vigour in January of 1997 and the present proposal of the Commission treats to resolve the problems of application of the transitory disposals on containers for gas transport and on the *cisternas.
In order of things, to Mr. *Pohjamo *le #would answer that the Directive 96\/35 on security advisers, that will go in in vigour from 1 January 2000, has to contribute to the application of legislation on transport of dangerous commodities, *hacerla more transparent and more in accordance with it that #all pretend.
In front of *usted, gentleman *Fischler, believe that it is not necessary to insist once again in the importance of this agreement with *Marruecos for States members, as *España and *Portugal, and for determined autonomous communities, as *Galicia, *Andalucía and Canarian, #all *ellas, as it is known, inside the Goal 1, very dependent of fishing and, for the time being, without *caladeros alternative for fleets and with a business structure that disables forms of cooperation.
Was *usted Commissioner in functions and *yo *me adhere to simile of mate *Varela *Suanzes-*Carpegna bear *decirle that here has *usted a good bull, a *miura bear *lidiar; undertake *usted a fine negotiation, *llévela to good port, defend *usted, gentleman Commissioner, the interests of the #european fishermen like Government #moroccan will defend the interests of the #his.
Therefore, to the equal that the sector, believe that time -and in this case seat especially that it was not the Council, because to *él is to the one who mainly *me direct- have to *plantarnos and give the signal that, #if well we carry years asking and begging that *nos allow to take part, as simple observers, in negotiations of fishing agreements, now already, gentleman President, #can not postpone participation.
#Can be insurances of thing: although to the principle of the present debate have not enumerated #all factors that leave of self-evident the importance of this agreement, especially for the sector *pesquero #spanish and also for the economy *pesquera #portuguese, am very conscious of transcendence that has.
Have understood that my colleague Commissioner *Byrne and president of the Scientific Committee Director have summoned press conference in *Bruselas for this afternoon to the 18 hours, in the that will give to know the results of the meeting of scientists.
Perhaps Mr. *Parish #can send a copy of speech to the boss of party, because lamentably, in Big *Bretaña, the boss of his favourable party that forbid import of #french products in Realm Joined.
With an embargo and export prohibition no combats illness *EEB. In this way, proceeds to the location of the problem and creates an instrument that allows to implant the rule of #european security stipulated by the Commission.
In *Francia, this Security Agency Sanitary Alimentary established thanks to pressure of the population, of consumers and, clear is, of environmentalists and of the Group of the Greens in the European Parliament.
Meanwhile, the authorities of Realm Joined have prepared his own system of labeling relative to the plan of *inocuidad of meat of bovine and have indicated that labeling system, with voluntary character, #would work in relation with exports to *Francia and to countries.
This Committee is the that celebrated the vote and issued a *dictamen unanimous, after having examined #all information that appeared in the report of the Special Committee and #some documents facilitated by the Special Group and, obviously, applying his own scientific knowledges.
The Commission has of an unanimous report of the best scientists and veterinary of the European Union, that have expressed his opinion that meat of bovine #british exported with arrangement to export plan according to a calendar established is so innocuous like any #another of *Europa.
Gentleman President, the #european pacts on employment, the processes of *Cardiff, of *Luxemburgo, of Colony and the combination among *ellos, dialogues *macroeconómicos, the technical organs and politicians of dialogues do not tend to boost employment in *Europa positively for workers.
*Me seems to understand that, further of #some statements of principle, there #be not at all effective, no exists any proposal, there #be not any rigorous analysis, although the analysis of health state of economies #european, in particular continental, #would have to be it.
By #this *nosotros want *hacerles a very concrete question: When go to reach agreements in the that they establish concrete criteria that allow to evaluate in how measured #can contribute the public investments to the consolidation of growth process, with effects also clearly positive in work market?
How resulted #can have the structural unemployment, unemployment of long length, the juvenile unemployment and efforts made with politics of employment and the 22 lines guidelines, with the action plans of the countries members?
In fact, *yo go to go more far and ask exclusion of workers that take part in the preparation of cool fish -and underline: fish cool-, because in the case of fish there #be not supply continuity.
According to the study of the Commission, in moment in that it approved the original directive on the labour day in *Irlanda hospital doctors no specialists worked more of the 65 hours allowed to the week and exerted tasks *indistinguibles of the of colleagues upper.
The quoted study enumerates also the following questions: fixation of turns no realistic, prolonged periods of continuous service, distribution of the tasks among auxiliary and upper doctors, pressures no official to doctors in period of training, vulnerability of rest periods and pressure rhythm and needs of service.
The problem that *nos poses in Chinese case -already has signalled *justificadamente and also *nos poses with countries- is the of the human rights, to the *cual it is necessary to add, in Chinese case, the problem of the *Tíbet, gestures *amenazadores to *Taiwan, etc.
By it that refers to the possible contribution of network Internet, think that by means of contact type and also, as it has said His *Señoría on purpose of the electronic trade, thanks to this type of scientific agreements will have #any forms of possible dialogue in the future.
*Nos have seen forced to work quickly, but on the other hand, also *me *atrevo to say that I regret the that my Group have not reached the agreement of the commission on a series of points that consider *prioritarios. Is therefore, gentleman *Pronk, by it that have decided to go back to present these amendments that *nos seem fundamental.
To opinion, is recommended that also in this field States members guide by behaviour of the three countries of the Union that obtain the best results, as it has come taking in the frame of the Economic and Monetary Union European and the own politics of employment.
Frankly hardly #can believe that this proposal to initiate a process of *Luxemburgo for the social security have been refused in commission by colleagues of the *PPE, in spite of constituting the core of the Report *Pronk that vote in the previous Parliament.
Thus, think like members of the *ELDR that with the package on employment has found a fine solution to the problem of how conciliate subsidiariness principle with the wish to guarantee coordination of employment politics.
The reports of the countries members on mood in that they fulfil the guidelines no only show how these countries the are by separate but that also open the path for a reciprocal inspiration, in the *cual some countries #can learn of the fine results of #others.
The *UEM has succeeded in measure that coordination of nature has made possible to reach the common goals that the countries proposed for inflation, for interest types and for the budgetary deficit.
*Cuando money #would have to be using to answer to the needs of women and men, to the needs of societies, the subject *Michelin symbolises dictatorship of the law of money on the economy and persons.
Investigations that finish to publish in *Gales, country that represent, show once again that women follow having a very low representation in direction places of companies and that do not rise in the professional career with rapidity that #would fit to expect of aptitudes.
In this context, *me remit also to reduction experiment of VAT in the sector services, the *cual was approved properly by the Council, but seem to be that States members no are, except #some exceptions. At least regarding my country, *Finlandia, had wished a different solution to the *respecto.
Before we happen to the next batch of votes on the report *Smet, #can concede to Mrs. *Smet the opportunity to clear, so that it state in Record, look that did not have the opportunity to clear at the end of the debate of yesterday in relation with fishermen to part that are autonomous.
Is necessary, especially, tackle reform and modernisation of education and in training that benefit to #all, without discrimination that base in the half social or in person, and that incorporate the technological and computer changes, #as well as combat *encarnizadamente #all unemployment forms and of precarious work.
treats of a subject essentially politician in the that it sees to the conservative right flirt with precariousness and to strengths of the left try put in foot the social convergence, insisting in relation among employment, quality and the social protection.
The use of fiscal facilities like "carrot" for the renewal of the old and heavy *utilitarios, is entirely justified, #as well as the fiscal advantages directed to the respectful vehicles with the environment: all #this so that it accelerate the introduction of vehicles less *contaminantes.
Gentleman *Lange, perhaps #can *usted try once again reach with the Council commitment in a nocturnal session, so that *nos see free of a decision in consciousness to vote against of his excellent report, in favour of the *cual *me #would enjoy to vote, or -almost it is necessary to say it now- against of the environment, since all goes back again to wait tail.
The Commission believes that development state of the necessary technology to apply limitations so severe to nitrogen oxides hampers in these moments acceptance of a previous date to October of the 2008.
Besides, *cuando in the 2001, in Nations Joined, take a balance of the First World-wide Summit of Boys, suggest that in Parliament believes a European Parliament of Boys, prepared with *ellos, to celebrate this European World-wide Summit in the 2001.
But also want to believe that, under responsibility of the Commission, #can think in promoting a comparative study of the incorporation of the Convention of the Rights of Boy to the national legislations of States members.
reason of this question is to ask to the Commission no only that it express of clear form respect to the proposals of Parliament, but especially *preguntarle by modalities and presentation terms of version reviewed in relation with the position of Parliament.
Although after the elections outline in this Assembly a new and distinct majority and although it have amendments that members of the *ELDR appreciate more that #others, yes, although it have elements of the proposal that *nos had enjoyed that they had remained was, back this initiative on query and the announcement of action.
On the other hand, the *segunda big amendment said that #if the direction of company retained information to the representatives of workers, had to take possible of sanction, and no only in the case of information retentions that the directions of companies judged important, that is a concept very little precise.
Like this, the worse salaried workers paid and even the unemployed or the that *carecen of domicile, when paying VAT on foods, contribute to fund the #european institutions that, without embargo, have not taken an alone measure in favour.
In the current system no exists already transparency because of the numerous individual regulations relative to collection tax of VAT, to the #british discount and finance.
Besides, the Commission refers to this evolution, #as well as to experience purchased of application until actuality to get to his current proposal that aspires to modify and reinforce directive valid the *cual *atañe, especially, to the sector of the agricultural costs.
But in the global transfer, that forms part of the three instruments, and that the Commission *nos had presented to increase payment credits, part of this group did not happens by this procedure in Plenary.
But, as I already have indicated, has not loaned attention to another big number of environmental looks. Of form #can not talk here at all of a more effective integration of the environmental dimension in the energetic politics.
Believe that fishermen will be able to enjoy of a better protection regulating the labour day or rest time by days or by weeks, as it proposes the Council, before that by a fixed limit of 48 hours inside reference period of 12 months.
there #be not, gentleman President, formal #european citizenships, there #be #european citizenship *cuando in the most next of #all branches of the right, the civil right, *Europa also has legitimacy and strength to guarantee rights of citizens and impose justice.
But exists -and here the words of Commissioner have been very clear- the absolute need to plant in *primer plane the nuclear security and expect that #this #such as it has said it *usted, gentleman Commissioner, was the guideline and the base of negotiations with neighbours of the *Europa Oriental.
From then finds *algo *empolvado in a drawer of Minister for the Protection of Consumers, Mrs. *Prammer. But thanks to the positive cooperation with the *ONG occupied in environmental subjects, knew of the existence of said study and from the past Thursday *nos have been able to occupy in depth of content.
To fault of official procedures to raise the prohibition inside the EU, the situation results even more difficult, as they testify it the #british management to reach the lifting of the prohibition in third countries, included States Joined, and in partners of the *Commonwealth.
Wanted to *decirle to gentleman Commissioner that here there #be had some agreements that have established clearly two obligations by part of sides: States Joined engaged to modify the title *IV of the law and to not applying the law to #european companies.
Subject: *Timor Oriental In the session of the European Parliament of the past 5 October, Commissioner *Patten informed of the absolute priority that concedes the European Commission to the subject of the humanitarian help and to reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
The Commission is guidelines on supervision and report presentation together with States members that will allow to take comparisons and add the results and maps from the year 2000, *cuando States members inform on the repercussions of his first programs of action.
Know that it has to, of course, and the Commission knows the important economic measures and social that have to adopt States members with a very intensive production to adapt the structures and methods *agropecuarios to the requirements of the directive.
In it that refers, gentleman *Pohjamo, *Señorías, to the list of the admissible regions, wanted to remember that the Commission had directed to States members a letter, on 1 July 1999, *pidiéndoles present proposals before 31 August 1999.
Want to require, #if have time, that requires a big flexibility, open, for each Been member, but have to find, in map that will be finally approved in the frame of the Goal 2, at least half of the population that initially identified like inhabitant in the eligible zones of compliance with the community criteria.
Expect that at the end of this year receive the reactions of States members and of Parliament so that we #can begin immediately to the beginning of the year 2000 to present a specific #european legislation on this question and follow exerting pressures for ratification of the Agreement of 1993.
Second, in the field of *Eurocontrol, and no only in the of *Eurocontrol but in #all the fields, have to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the operation of the providers of aerial services and, besides, carry out division among it that they are the statutory responsibilities and service provision.
#Can the Commission describe the general situation regarding measures adopted by the countries candidates for *modernizar systems of social security and, on the other hand, inform of measures adopted and foreseen to contribute to effort of the countries candidates to this *respecto?
Is it that have taken in the past and will follow it taking in the future, #if well I want *indicarle that here the practical is very diverse, is to say, that is not true that the majority of candidates to adhesion was by behind standards of States members in this question.
Subject: enlargement of the Union and the agreement of *Schengen The countries candidates will have to assume legislation of the EU in matter of expedition of visas and controls of entrance in borders of the EU. #This involves a considerable change in practices of #some of these countries.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Secretary of the Council and High Representative for the External Politics and of Common Security, gentleman Commissioner, *Señorías, in the first place want to hail appearance of Mr. #Solana in his triple condition of General Secretary of the Council, High Representative for the External Politics and of Common Security and General Secretary of the *UEO, for the moment *in *pectore.
In the exercise of his new responsibilities, will have *usted in my Group to a demanding speaker, #if it gets the case, severely critical, but deeply convinced that the European Union has to be more present, be more active, more *voluntarista in the international scene.
And more *parabienes, but #this seriously, as simple suggestion, for the external politics and of common security. Probably follow the procedure of the Economic and Monetary Union with regard to a diplomatic union and soldier #can be a fine suggestion to translate the statements of principle in steps more concrete.
The permanent dialogue with the previous Commissioner, *Sir *Leon *Brittan, along 1998 and in the first months of 1999 contributed, on the other hand, to that the Communication of the Commission of 14 July 1999 incorporated #many of the approaches of the European Parliament and all content.
Consider likewise fundamental the principles of caution and alimentary security, because we do not want that *nos invade foods *transgénicos, and by #this consider necessary to invest charge of proof and that experts are really independent of the interests of the Governments and of multinationals.
game point of the Report *Haug was that the position of past March, especially the relative point to the elimination of #all exception clauses, has to carry now to practice.
Create, thus, *parafraseando it that Mr. *Patten said during intervention, that is bad to trade with states that violate the human rights of massive form - *él referred then to Chinese in answer to a #ours question - and that, in fact, also is well not forgetting the financial and economic measures *cuando treats to issue a clear signal.
Our negotiators have to encourage by that these countries really take part to *través of the institutional support, the free entrance in our markets, fulfillment of the #granting agreed -for example, *cuando treat of the textile products- and prevention of the called "green protectionism" .
The one who pleads by the demolition of the #european agricultural politics, pleads, simultaneously, by the destruction of #everything it that in *Europa has reached in the field of the rural politics, of the welfare of animals and of the welfare of persons.
By the contrary, *cuando integration deficit results of the internal politics or of deficient development, the extension of the terms of application, the multiplication of preferential measures, do not constitute fine solutions.
Take the word, in this case in name of Budget Commission, to mention the main points that said commission considers important that treat in the Conference of reform of the Treaties, splitting of the base that the that lives out of the budget in politics lives in error.
#This includes also division of the Council of Ministers -#such as it proposed the Report *Dehaene- in a Council of executive Ministers, that #can celebrate sessions to enclosed door, and a Council of legislative Ministers, #whose meetings #would have to be public.
The positions expressed in the report of Gentlemen *Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen were reinforced by the illustrated to Parliament, with the communications of President *Prodi and of Mr. *Barnier, in name of the European Commission day after the vote in our commission.
In any case, the problem that poses the *legitimación of space or a market without State requires that we take an attempt, that has to go accompanied of the creation of a #european civil society and training of a #european public opinion.
In October, in the special meeting of the Council of *Europa in *Tampere on the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice, took upsetting, among things, in the importance to confront the problems derived of drug in whole.
The complementary question that take to the Council is #if it #can consider the possibility to go in in contact with Government #moroccan so as to avert that it undertake now this absolutely dangerous adventure for *Marruecos and, of course, for *nosotros, neighbours more next.
Gentleman President, do not take the word to take part on bottom content of the question of Mr. *Alavanos, but to take comment and direct afterwards a question to Mr. Minister on purpose of the answer that has given.
#would Be necessary to clear it before possible obstacles for the opening of the *Danubio, but has not been possible to begin to cooperate in this sense, and *Jugoslavia neither has adopted measure to open the *Danubio, although yes it #would be #his responsibility in virtue of the international agreements.
Now well, #if we do not have time to examine the question this morning, #if there #be *demasiados orators inscribed to take the word in relation with the Report *Napolitano and with the Report *Giannakou, then will second the proposal of Mr. *Pirker that we do not vote tomorrow on the question.
Gentleman President, so only want to remember that article 115 of the Regulation, already applied regarding the Report *Napolitano, foresees that "except in urgency cases foreseen in articles 50 and 112, only will be able to proceed to the debate and to the vote of a text #if #this has been distributed with *veinticuatro hours of *antelación like minimum" .
Takes five months that Parliament #would have to have accepted this agreement, and *me seems that the public opinion simply will not appreciate a new refusal to follow advance and to establish a rigorous diet but *equitativo for Parliament, the same that for the organs.
#This constitutes a general permission to an authority, that no only leaves to deputies to favour of complaint, but that creates delation system and of political agitation that supposes an insult to the free mandate and to a free Parliament.
Without embargo, estimate that the debates of Parliament, of our parliamentary commission have been sufficient to be able to elaborate a good report like #this with support of the greater part of the political Groups and congratulate to the speaker by work.
In my opinion, the communication of the Commission represents a good point of game for development of a world-wide #european strategy, *multidisciplinaria and integrated of fight against the illicit drugs in accordance with the that approved the General Assembly of Nations Joined in 1998.
Believe that Parliament that do not has value to amend patent situation discrimination that reaches to #some of members and to millions of #european citizens, is Parliament that #can not teach, as it #would want to and as it #can, democracy to countries that have condemned even this morning.
As *ustedes have underlined it, simultaneously to the promotion of the foundations of the economy, emergency of a political power that was to the height of task and development of the necessary institutions will be essential elements.
Against of it that finishes to say #ours colleague, think that in occasion exist reasons more that sufficient so that *nos congratulate by the fact that the European Union, by unanimity, have presented a resolution in front of Nations Joined so as to ask a moratorium for death pity.
Gentleman President, am totally in accordance with Mrs. *Díez *González on the need to treat to convince to the Council, so that it introduce in the agreements with the third countries a clause on death pity and abolition.
And while all *eso occurs, the *LIV General Assembly of the UN did not approve the resolution proposal of the Presidency #finnish of the Council of the European Union that advocated the suspension of the executions of penalties of death.
*Nosotros have taken part immediately, to title of the humanitarian help, with an amount of more of euro million, in three successive operations, and are had to continue taking part to answer to the most urgent needs of the next year.
Are absolutely conscious of the deplorable situation in the that find boys, and especially girls, in *Pakistán; but think that the most effective way to improve this situation is contributing to guarantee a universal primary education of quality and affordable.
The Convention on the Rights of Boy recognises that progenitors are responsible to provide the had to taken care and the owed attention to children, #as well as the right of children to receive care, orientation and love.
Thus it #can not have a politics of #european drugs *reglamentada, but a #european frame inside the *cual #can help to person affected, that has to be the centre, from the respective specific experiences of the local and regional instances competent.
Everywhere #where reach to prevent that the pertinent illegal money of drug traffic transform in legal money, give a big step forward, because the fight against drug traffic and money bleaching are two phenomenons related.
Finally, want to signal that, in this field, the European Observatory of *Lisboa exerts an important work, and am convinced that in the next years data and information that there collect will show the effectiveness of the #european cooperation, and international, in this fight.
*Cuando Parliament and the public opinion were surprised by informations transmitted by the press, according to the *cuales an institution, that, as we thought, devoted only to structural investments, had lost sums very elevated in speculative operations in the short term, resulted clear the need to examine of form *cabal investment politics of the *BEI.
Are convinced that, with the suitable means, the European Observatory of Drug and the *Toxicomanías, situated in *Lisboa, #can take an important contribution to the deepening of the study and of the proposals of measures to struggle against this *flagelo of drug.
With #everything, is the fact that the debate and the vote have taken place in spite of article 115 of the Regulation, had account that the last #french version was distributed to the 21.52 hours of Wednesday and have proceeded to the debate a lot before they fulfilled the 24 hours.
Nevertheless, #some of *nosotros, like deputies pertinent of the Canarian islands, in addition to consider reasonable that *prorrogue the force of tax in accordance with the proposal presented by the Commission, have requested through amendments that affect to the most sensitive products, to #all the sensitive products produced in Canarians.
Projects of transport like the *road *to was for the relief of road networks traditional require crafts of type like the *just *in *time *feeder and transport ships of containers, ferries fast and yachts of high speed, multipurpose ships for fishing and *guardacostas, ships of luxury for tourism so much great like small, etc.
From *Viana *do *Castelo until *Margueira and *Mitrena, happening by dockyards of Port districts, *Aveiro and *Figueira gives *Foz; workers demand valorisation politics of the naval sector, of defence of the stable employment, of quality and with #worthy wages and that promote the *aprovechamiento of the existent capacities.
To comprise the current situation, is necessary to remember that no is the international agreement of 1994, relative to the elimination of helps to the naval construction in the frame of liberalisation of the sector.
Is necessary also that the Commission give priority to this problem and to resolution, recognise the need to review ancient positions and facilitate to the European Parliament #all informations on damages caused to the naval industry #european.
Therefore, the Council has decided aptly that for the moment it did not goes to break the agreement to put end to the generic help of industry of the naval construction from 1 January 2001.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen deputies, *yo also am #basque; am a #basque woman; a socialist and #basque woman; #one more of the 92% of citizens of the Basque Country that have voted in *Euskadi in favour of Autonomy Statute and that have voted by democracy.
*Les put another concrete example: #if, with occasion of a big championship, sell tickets of access to stadium only to the national citizens and *deniega the possibility of *comprarlos to the no national citizens, to the citizens #european, contravene norms of competition and, therefore, here it is necessary to act with rigour.
My task #would have resulted much simpler #if it had had the possibility to elaborate an authentic politics in the field of sport on the base of article of the Treaty.
#If we want to be represented like European Union in the field of the world-wide economy *globalizada and in the increasing *intervinculación political of the world is precise that endow at last to the European Union of juridical capacity, so that the representatives of the European Union also #can act in name of the Union.
And *yo #would give also an enormous dimension to *algo that hardly has been mentioned: are a parallel exercise of *constitucionalización of the Treaties, with the preparation of a Letter of fundamental rights, to time that poses the Conference *Intergubernamental.
#There is a fundamental point to the that want *ceñirme in my intervention, *me refer to the comment of the Commission collected in report for the summit that the conference *intergubernamental that is will be able to close with hit before the year 2000 #if the political will is it sufficiently strong.
So that it state in record, wanted to leave clear that, in accordance with colleagues of the Green Group\/European Free Alliance, in the Scottish Nationalist Party are engaged with the idea of a collective security in *Europa and receive with satisfaction performance of the Council in this sense.
And have to take advantage of this economic cycle and the statement that goes to take on the Presidency #finnish concerning #millenium and the new society of information so that we #can register, with creativity, growth sustained and so that the goal of the full employment was not rhetorical, but that materialise.
The resolution proposal that have seen this morning did not contain quotation of initiative relative to the inner market neither to society of information, in spite of works made under Presidency.
To begin, regarding the subject of employment, *nosotros consider it very important and have prepared it, as I already said in my intervention, with seen to that the first summit of employment of history, that will celebrate under the Presidency #portuguese, was #all hit.
will Mention so alone #one in the that *me seems that the European Union has to dump in depth: the constitution of the International Penal Court, that #would finish, gentleman President, with the situation in that now *nos find, in the that the international social demand did not corresponds at all with the instruments *jurisdiccionales that are to disposal.
Know that it will be a long and difficult path. Proof of *ello is the fault of debate in the Organisation of Nations Joined of the resolution of the European Union on the moratorium to the capital executions.
The report in question, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, the first of this type, deserves praise type and constitutes a *primer step to a politics of human rights in the that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have to work of conjoint form.
Besides, the Commission of Budgetary Control wishes that it take reference to the Agreement *interinstitucional of 6 May of this year and that indicate that quantities *indicativas for the period 2000-2002 form part of the financial frame *plurianual of Program *Meda so that it remain clear that no treats of a new cost.
Have an only technical comment to the amendment 15 of the relative report to the economic cooperation in the that says that the Council with qualified majority or the European Parliament #can decide the suspension of collaboration.
*Yo appreciate a lot the debate that has developed, as it has been an objective debate, a debate that has contributed observations very valuable and important, especially also for *Turquía, that will have to value also #which is the political climate in *Europa regarding adhesion aspirations to the European Union.
#This is a very important step and *yo even #would affirm that the fact that for the first time it define value limit for substance *carcinógena, specifically for the *benceno, that #can cause leukaemia, marks a milestone in the field of legislation on the quality of the air acclimatise.
do not back part of the amendment, since it has to have a reference to the community goal of 120*g\/*km. The European Parliament has left sideways in amendment the date in that it will have to fulfil with this goal, is to say, the year 2010.
The Commission proposes alternative, with the following text: "The Commission studies the possibility to establish reference frame for the fiscal measures that boost tourism use of low consumption of fuel."
More that modify the regulation, it that takes the proposal is to assume an agreement of the Council of ministers; is really an exception to the regulation, because *Portugal did not achieve to reach quota that had awarded in the campaign 1997-1998 by some bad meteorological conditions, as they affirm.
Like this, think that it is more correct to increase and improve the current system of calculation of contingents, with parallel increases of the total sums of help to production and no *orientarnos to a system of global thresholds that #can comport damages for #all producers and no only for the that *rebasaron contingents.
To5-0067\/1999 of Mrs. *Fraga *Estévez, in name of Fishing Commission, on regulation proposal of the Council (*COM(1999) 055 - *C4-0141\/1999 - 1999\/0047(*CNS)) by the that it establishes the common organisation of markets in the sector of products of fishing and of aquaculture.

The Commission has initiated takes little a horizontal investigation on the existent situation in #all States members to observe the community problems and the that affect only to a determined Been member and, like this, tackle this problem of a more structural form.
Gentleman President, by it that have understood in the first part of the answer of Mr. Commissioner, the Commission is totally indifferent in front of the consequences that involve the bridges shattered of the *Danubio and, of it only of it that occupies is of how take use of this natural disaster -to the that *ella same has contributed- to overthrow to the leaders of *Yugoslavia, chosen legal and democratically.

The Treaty of *Amsterdam -*nos has remembered it Mrs. *Hautala- has sanctioned this notion of transparency conceding to citizens a true right of access to the documents of Parliament, of the Council and of the Commission.

*Me have abstained to vote the common resolution on *Kosovo because from the principle have not shared decision of military intervention of NATO that consider error and, besides, avoidable.
In *Rambouillet, in effect, to tenor of the statements of #some participants authorised, existed some favourable political conditions to initiatives that, to mood to see, were effective and that #would have been able to avert death of *tantos innocent and the dramatic deportations of *cientos of thousands of #kosovar citizens, victims of the absurd nationalism of *Milosevic.
From sight point, any #european country is safe: will suffice that it blow wind so that the very fine dust of uranium was dragged to #Italia, *Alemania, *Hungría and to #all *Europa, with death effects caused in *Arabia #Saudi by the bellicose pollution caused in *Iraq during war of the Gulf.
The fact to \@atener to this ancient conception of *Europa has had like consequence discourage, weaken and *marginar, in the SIN, to the leaders and managers pertinent of the dissident sectors, to the *reformadores, that fixed look in *nosotros, and allow that the pertinent persons of totalitarian systems *recobraran prestige, of the that *Milosevic constitutes his archetype.

*Cuando the commercial exchanges or even consumption *transfronterizo accelerate, see clearly that the financial services do not accompany this new reality or that even do not adapt to #this, but that or well continue enclosed in his national and sectorial logic, or well seem to consider that this sector *reviste scarce interest.

Part of the report on program *DAPHNE contains information about the #european campaign allocated to improve awareness about the question of violence against woman, that initiated month happened in Colony under the presidency #german.
These organisations need help precisely to hour to create the distinct networks, to reach an effective diffusion of information, to find associated and to boost a mutual exchange.
Believe that it is also very important expand gradually program to the rest of the countries, especially to the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental, since violence, in #all modalities, has dimension *transfronteriza, for example in variant of sexual trade or of pornography childish through Internet.

As well, here have to *hacerme spokesman of the resolution of Regulation Commission, that will incorporate to doctrine that, with proof and along the years, comes establishing, and is that Parliament do not dissolves and that Parliament has to regulate, has to resolve on the problems that *le pose from the *primer until the last day of mandate.
Wanted to reassure it *diciéndole that the commission do not goes to remain absorbed in the Commission of Institutional Subjects: goes to combine with this commission to create a new Commission of Constitutional Subjects, that will be very important in this Assembly.

Finally, my wanted colleagues, it is necessary to continue with liberalisation of telecommunication sectors, energy and transports, guarantee a better finance of #SME and set up reform of the fiscal and social systems, #as well as of the educational systems and of professional training.
since the calls to coordination of the fiscal systems -and alas in paragraph 34 the speaker decants thus- they finish for embezzling this second mechanism of adjust to States members, *nos remains then unemployment like instrument of regulation, or also pressure on wages.
But also is true that a situation with types of stable interest, with stable prices, with types of low interest opens to States members of the European Union a space of action considerably wider that up to now to delete the chronic unemployment.

#Can ensure that the Commission, in virtue of relations and on the base of data that it has, will take a global assessment and will present, in case, at the end of experimentation period, the corresponding proposals to give follow-up to essay.
Like conclusion, for me, as *londinense, this weekend *nos has taken to see very graphic and tragically the importance of support to a *Europa of impartiality and justice for #all citizens, the need that *nos engage in the fight against intolerance, racism and hate, against conceptions.
The resumption of the institutional dynamics, the establishment of these clear lines also is a need to give an opportunity to enlargement of the European Union.
That *ustedes take managers of it that today are in this Assembly in front of the public opinion European in favour of this #european Constitution, so that citizens know rights and duties above the fights and of the interests of States members.
Now goes to produce relief and Parliament has to ensure that before no *prorroguen agreements with friends neither treat to rise to persons or to move to employees of his own cabinets to the administration.

The Group *Europa of Nations wants to reestablish growth in *Europa, in the first place, by means of decrease of the compulsory exactions allocated to the structural Bottoms, to continuation by means of the lifting of the rigidities that characterise the management of the euro.

Was in Tyrant days 21, 22 and 23 April and there warned the need that it felt the presence of the European Parliament that no *me seems that to date it have organised an official presence in this region, thing that probably #would be timely to take.
*Yo #would contribute two basic reflections: the first -that saves relation with intervention of President in exercise of the Council, minister *Fischer- is that we are a new stage that goes to characterise by the nomination, by part of the Council, of the High Representative for the *PESC.
#If the Treaty establishes a mechanism, that is totally atypical in the sense that it is to Parliament to the that *le corresponds articulation of the text whereas the approval corresponds to the Council, do not change this balance also of *rondón and by the door of backwards.
Which results more unacceptable still #if it considers that, *cuando adopt a decision to the *respecto in December session, approve a text very *ponderado and balanced. Of compliance with #the same, diets of the #european deputies will be inferior in the future to the of the three States members more populated of the European Union.
And talking of promotions, precisely of section 2 in that it talks of *ellas, Mr. *Filippi and *yo same go to present amendment in the that, in addition to accepting the revaluation of 490 places, go to support also the permanent places and the temporary places that have accepted already, #as well as the three promotions *ad *personam .

This morning, in the first reading have gone back to collect with reason the procedure and have gone back to repeat in the *primer reading sight point of Parliament of the first previous reading.
*Me #would enjoy to take #some observations to this proposal. By part am not satisfied with way in that it has voted the proposal in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and in Protection Commission of Consumer.
Have to take upsetting especially the application of the principle of information before the celebration of agreement, so that information offered provide value added to information delivery already foreseen in the vertical directives.
Gentleman President, wanted to express my gratitude to the Presidency of the Council and especially to Mrs. *Bonino and to collaborators for having got to form agreement *tripartita that it was agreed by the Council and by the delegation of Parliament.
So that they do not produce problems of interpretation that *desfavorezcan to consumer, in the result of conciliation went back to reiterate clearly, that the free creation of the contractual state of commodity means, that the necessary costs, #such like costs of sending, of hand of drama and of material will run to charge of the seller.
The intention of the proposal was to create minimum harmonisation of the legal disposals inside each Been member in particular on the need of legal guarantees, that already mentioned with eloquence Mr. *Whitehead.
Besides, when establishing value limit more strict, will have to consider the available technology and especially the principle that have proposed for #all measures on the environment and that has been recognised also by Parliament, the principle of cost relation and of benefits.
But *yo believe that it treats of important points, and -Mrs. *Sandbæ*k already has mentioned it- the *plaguicidas in foods of babies was controversy point very strong, and in these cases treats of the health of babies and small boys.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, Mr. *Corbett no only has merit to substitute of excellent form to the speaker but that also has detailed very explicitly the practical development and advances in the procedures of *codecisión in the that it bases this report.
Gentleman President, have received a letter of services of Cabinet of President in the that *me said that like the debate on *Kosovo went to celebrate yesterday in the afternoon, did not go to argue the questions that my gentlemen colleagues and *yo had presented for today in the afternoon to the Council.
Is to expect that group presidents obtain backrest of the majority of the new Parliament that form after 10 June to finish to clear and order the question of the *viáticos. As *nosotros still have not achieved it.

The European Council of Colony will have to save omissions and seat premises for reform of the Commission, enlargement of the vote by qualified majority and the *reponderación of the votes in breast of the Council.
*Cuando argue of institutional reforms, think also that no treats only of figures but that strength fault of Parliament regarding cooperation with the Council and the Commission -*me refer here to the absence of procedure of *codecisión- plant really in the agenda in this Conference.
The central elements are: majority vote like norm, new weighting of the votes in the Council, structural transformation of the Commission #as well as the right of the European Parliament to issue *dictámenes of compliance in #all the modifications of the Treaty.
Of compliance with section 2 of article 37 and of section 5 of article 40 of the Regulation, have received eight proposals of resolution on the European Council of Colony and the oral questions on the institutional reform.
services of Plenary *nos have informed that this conjoint debate on Diary 2000 will initiate with a statement of the Council and of the Commission and, to continuation, will take part the first orators of the Groups, no the speakers.
By means of the almost anticipation -go it to describe like this- of *Amsterdam, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have shown going out #one to meeting of the other that it is possible to reach in a relation of positive tension resulted that they take to advance to the EU in whole.
did not proposes any serious strategy in favour of employment, conforming with suggesting that it continue, pure and simply, politics *macroeconómica monetarist that makes from takes years, and that has not given proof of efficiency for *asentar a sustained and durable growth and to take that it reduce unemployment of massive form.
In the draft, the Council presents a series of proposals of statute, in the that appears reflected, for example, that payment of compensations will carry out by means of the presentation of *justificantes, in addition to diverse proposals more directed to establish the labour conditions of assistants.
The Conservative Group and the *Socialdemócrata have put in danger today with attitude the credibility of the European Parliament when refusing the proposal of the Liberal Group for a Statute of deputies.
Regarding commercialisation of meats with hormones, in addition to the consequences that #can know in terms of disequilibriums of production in an agricultural activity *estructuralmente *excedentaria and very *fragilizada after the crisis of the *EEB, the consequences for the human health of meat consumption with hormones are far to be *desdeñables although they are known partially.
The World-wide Organisation of Trade, #such as it has been negotiated by the Commission and imposed to States members, tricks of the principle of caution and sanitary security that State has to can keep to preserve security of his national.
Gentleman President, is by conviction and no by taste by contradictions by it that will not vote whole of legislative resolutions relative to the Inform Diary 2000, with exception of the relative to the *OCM of wine, since we are against of the positions of the Commission and of the Council that result of commitment of *Berlín.
Wanted to warn to any political Group that was in playing to politics *partidista with this vote, that the blockade of these proposals #would mean to have to expect until the new Parliament #can vote in autumn, and *ello #would take *peligrar more of 200.000 millions in resources and #would comport interminable delays for the communities and the local projects.
was not easy the #exegesis of the approaches of the colleagues, but have found formula that has allowed, with four amendments of transaction, achieve the majority withdrawal of other and, at the same time, keep the spirit of the proposal of our commission.
In the first place, the need to guarantee existence of resources budgetary community sufficient to cover the needs of the sector in the frame of the structural politics *pesquera.
#One of *ellas -that saves relation with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam- is that in opinion of the speaker -that did not triumph in Plenary, but that now, with the Treaty of *Amsterdam in vigour, purchases full sense- have to consider #all this process like a process of conjoint strategy of the Union that has to conduct to conjoint actions.
But in my opinion, the European Parliament has put more in place of the countries candidates to comprise how is it that mean conditions of the European Union in practice of the political life of said countries.
#This is a central point from the perspective of Parliament. For *nosotros, also is important that the countries *beneficiarios use this instrument to know the rules and mechanisms of the structural politics and that, in this way, the back adhesion was easier.
The Council decided likewise separate of the original proposal of the Commission and increase the objective amount until the 9 %, instead of the 8 % proposed by the Commission, like coefficient of bottom for the group of pending commitments of the Community.
*Me allow to remember it that Commissioner *Fischler said in occasion: this political is so important because we always have to answer to the question of how #can take in the labour market the brother and the sister of a young agriculturalist that inherits exploitation?
*Sintéticamente, #this #would be the basic points that carried to Budget Commission to change Monday at night rejection position to the Agreement *interinstitucional and propose to Plenary that accept it, together with the financial perspectives *anejas.
Have supported #Galileo, the #european proposal in matter of global system of navigation, and have supported to Transport Commission in wish to allocate the 55 % of bottoms to the railways and a maximum of the 25 % to roads.
Express my gratitude -no only in name of the Commission, but in a much wider plane, in name of the public in general of the Community and of the sector- by forecast and commitment shown by Parliament in this subject.
#If tomorrow Parliament did not get to the agreement to give approval to an Agreement *Interinstitucional, will not have then of the financial frame on the that have debated and on #whose base have agreed agreements: the *Quinto program mark of investigation and networks *transeuropeas.
A last decision of the Council, to instances of Parliament, has included #one *cuarta community initiative, the *cual also believe that it will benefit in looks very concrete to some populations determined of the European Union, although it do not have the community dimension that have the #others three initiatives.
Subject: safe Foods During winter months and spring are, in #all the countries of the European Union, campaigns of national field around the subject of security of the alimentary products and health.
export capacity of the *Iraq is at present increased with a *subprograma of the program «oil by foods», but because of planning terms and supply will apply fully only from the spring of the 2000, #if well *ustedes know that price of oil supposes a factor of insecurity in both directions.
Also #would wish that *me gave his opinion on #if in the case of *Iraq no *infringe the treaty of *Viena, that forbids the starvation of citizens like form of war; Considers that no *infringe the Proclamation of the Human Rights and the Agreement on the Rights of boys?
Gentleman representative of the Council, perhaps will have observed *usted that, in communication of 23 March, the European Parliament takes for granted that in the new Commission will have a considerably greater number of women that in actuality.
By the contrary, fortunately, only in exceptional cases the administration of the Council has seen promoted to proceed strictly against civil servants that have not respected the norms of professional behaviour in the exercise of tasks.
Work exclusively in base to experience that have accumulated in Peace Program and Reconciliation in *Irlanda of the North and also of #some programs of environment that have had hit there and in the that the *ONG have taken the initiative and have received help with charge to bottoms of the European Union.
is not own of the Presidency take observations on bottom of what has said; but believe that yes it is it the *darle the thanks to *usted and to Gentlemen colleagues of the Presidency #german because I believe that they always have shown respect and eagerness of collaboration and because they have had a presence really live in this Assembly.
Therefore, my political Group, the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left\/Nordic Green Left, will not give support to reform of the *PAC that will suppose, in fact, the deepening of his main disequilibriums.
Without embargo, my main objection against employment of article 203 is the following: will take that finance of enlargement depend of the uncertain results of the annual budgetary conflicts among the Council and the European Parliament.
The Council and the Commission have declared #willing, in relation with the ratification calendar of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, to recognise amply to Parliament rights that, especially in the capitulate of the structural reform, #can demand formally from 1 May of this year.
villages of *Europa no *nos will concede credibility #if on the one hand we say: want to control a series of problems and take it having for *ello a series of bottoms, but on the other hand take to disappear money in the pockets of organisations and persons to those who do not corresponds.
Is evident that #if in *Europa had modulation among the richest zones and the poorest, the poorest #would not need, of course, resource that calls «rural development», idea enough wanders and quite bad endowed of bottoms, that, as we know #all, #can serve for #everything, as in a «#spanish inn».
Is an unlucky fact and, besides, the regulation takes impossible that #can go back to present this amendment, which means that we will not be able to obtain a nominal vote on the fact that members are not *ateniendo to the question of transparency.
Without embargo, in my opinion, has not taken reference to a circumstance, in concrete to that go to have to reinvent the market economy #if we want that villages of *Europa central and oriental, the new democracies of *Europa central and oriental reach *algún day #status to convert in members of the European Union.
Gentleman President, during five years have heard and learnt in Budget Commission that the only possibility to prepare a good budget and take advantage of #all possibilities consists in reaching an agreement *interinstitucional that guarantee the financial perspectives during seven years.
#If #any time has existed recipe to reach a dissemination and discrimination against the traditional local companies, able to increase unemployment of unnecessary way, has been #this.
Now *nos find in a different stage: *nos find in front of a decision of the Commission and this report -lo and behold importance- collects the *dictamen of the European Parliament that gets after negotiation months with the Commission and the Council.
has to, as, congratulate to the social speakers for adding this new agreement on agreements with a length determined to his previous agreement on the temporary work, and expect that they reach quickly a new agreement on workers employed by means of agencies of temporary employment.
Of course, in addition to the goal of the commercial liberalisation, asked also that the agreement included guarantees for the environmental protection and respect to the basic labour norms of the International Organisation of Work.
And together with progresses, also have to be conscious and recognise difficulties that represents the inclusion in the field of the European Union of the Agreement of *Schengen, that is an enclosed world and that, besides, builds to the *margen of the European Union to be able to work.
But of here to two or three years, the reality surely will surpass forecasts, until point that, to be true the figures that stir at present, in the year 2001 *ciento ten millions of #PC will be allocated to the use of the electronic trade, that will move #two hundred one thousand millions of dollars.
The fact that especially the *Länder Germans insist in withdrawing the similar services to broadcast - as they formulate here - of the field of application of the electronic trade, has origin in the #german internal situation.
Nevertheless, *Señorías, Parliament adopted two months ago amendment to article 5, section 1, that establishes that #that *cashing drops in the field of the directive on rights of author, is to say, in the judicial protection of the author, whereas the *cashing like #such do not involves exploitation of information transmitted.
This same morning also have requested that President and the Table, that in moment were not present, give green light so that in the next days a delegation of Parliament displace to Blunt so as to interview with Mr. *Rugova.
This morning have had votes according to the new procedure of *Amsterdam, in the that have not been able to *quedarnos with #some isolated amendments like the amendment 28, that #would demand a review clause of this perspective that extends -as they already have said #some speakers this morning- along seven years without review.
The birth of coin only #can involve aggravation of disequilibriums among States because of the acceleration of the *deslocalizaciones, well to States or regions more competitive that #others, or well of regions that cross difficulties to the dominant economic axes that already outline (northwest of *Alemania, the *Benelux, Island of *Francia, the north of #Italia).
The debates on Diary 2000 have lasted more of a year and have constituted the most important part of works of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development of Parliament.
#can not by less to say that the results of the Summit of *Berlín in the field of reform of the common organisations of market in the sectors of milk, meat of *vacuno and cereals no *me excite too much.
The Commission, that already *detenta monopoly of the initiative, *apropiaría like this of the executive power European, to convert in the Government of the European Union, since the Council #would limit to exert paper of *segunda parliamentary house, that pronounces by majority.
To the listen interventions of deputies during the debate that has taken place in this hemicycle, #as well as interventions of President of the French Republic, *me surprises to check that the analysis of errors limits essentially to a *cuestionamiento personal of *Slobodan *Milosevic, of family and of his gathered.
Regarding the next institutional reform, is very desirable that the voice of Parliament have greater weight and that, *contrariamente to the ancient method, that had disappointed seriously, reform centre in a true dialogue *interinstitucional, which is perfectly expressed in points 8 and 12 of our resolution.
Is important that the two legislative institutions of the Union issue a same *dictamen and, therefore, that the centre of gravity for the taking of decisions was situated in an equidistant point among the Council and the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, like our debate on actuality problems, urgency and special importance will treat amply the relative questions to the human rights, *yo #would wish to inform of a relatively grave fact that produced in *Marruecos against citizen #french, Mrs. *Danze-*Serfaty.
Ask to President of the European Parliament that direct to the #moroccan authorities to protest against this expulsion of citizen #french and to demand the right of #Abraham *Serfaty to return to country.
#If it follows killing to the leaders, #if the populations have to escape to mountains and have fear to go to vote, #if thousands of persons that were moved in the last year to *Timor, *proindonesios, have right to vote, #if leaders like *Xanana *Gusmãor follow prisoners, believe that it will not be possible to celebrate a free and just referendum for *Timor Oriental.
Nations Joined, the European Union and the international community in general has to keep pressure on Indonesian so that #this accept a military presence that guarantee neutrality of the referendum and prevent that it convert in a farce of unpredictable bloody consequences.
Gentleman President, *Timor Oriental is #one of the symbolic files in the that are in game the human rights and in the that the absence of rights of villages and the absence of a true recognition of the right of self-determination conducts daily to a terrible drama.
On the other hand, gentleman President, this week have presented a question written in the that request amnesty of 250 arrested persons in the #palestinian territory no *enjuiciados, but service *me has communicated that the answer to this question will not have already place and neither publication.
In the short term -as it affirms also in the Statement of *Berlín-, the European Union follows concerned by stagnation of the peace process and to this *respecto is fundamental that after the elections in #Israel, parts go back urgently to a whole application of the respective commitments subscribed in the Memorandum of *Wye *River.
Am the first deputy in history of the European Parliament that has penetrated in runners of death, the past 21 April, fourteen days ago, for *reunirme with *Mumia *Abu #Jamal, political prisoner convict to death, in #whose favour often Parliament has approved resolutions.
will Conclude this last speech, this last cry of the that they do not have voice, taking meeting signal of blacks -are #many blacks that today struggle in States Joined against death pity, together with whites, Indians, *amerindios, Hispanics- and pronouncing the words: "*On *the *move!» .
Like conclusion, have to urge to the authorities *malasias to that they recognise that development of a greater political cooperation and economic among the European Union and *Malasia will depend to a large extent that it initiate a serious dialogue that end in the that in *Malasia give steps for observation of the fundamental human rights in said country.
graces, gentleman *Vecchi, by words, by obstinacy with that has followed to the countries *ACP and by obstinacy put in breast of the commission that has followed #all looks of cooperation and of development.
#Can entrust in that it find, sure enough -and is indispensable that the Union contribute to *ello-, a solution that allow to stabilise relations among the three islands -#if #this is possible, and anyway is it that wish- and that take into account the specific needs, particular, of the populations of each #one of these islands, that, although they do not find very moved away #one of #others, possess these specificities that finish to mention.
The military coup d'état that, obviously, condemn, produced as a result of the grave incidents caused in Big *Comora by pertinent persons of the Island of *Anjouan, #as well as by the objective inability of the civil authorities to guarantee reunification process and of pacification of State.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, this Assembly always has conceded special importance to the nuclear security, since #all know that in case that it produce accident in a nuclear head office, #this no only affects to persons that work in *ella and that live in the *inmediaciones, but that prejudices to #all the inhabitants of *Europa. Is therefore by it that we have to watch of wall security norms.
Had wished that #all the that today they have presented a resolution, *me refer especially to the Group of the Popular Party European, *nos had backed more firmly in the past and that #all the that have signed the resolution that have in front had put more obstinacy in convincing to his *correligionarios.
Lady Speaker, in the decision of the Agriculture Council have adjusted compensations by price discount of grain with compensations in crop of the industrial potatoes.
The Euro, like element of development of the last years, of so big importance especially for the future, will have place, and have achieved, by means of requests to the distinct commissions, can use the Euro like electronic money in the most different sectors.
To disequilibrium it is necessary to add the multiplicity of preferential agreements, signed already or ready to be it, with third countries by part of the Union, just *cuando the announcement of a new cycle of negotiations *multilaterales puts in question the suitability of these bilateral agreements.
Is to say, that was considered a sector *marginal, condemned to disappear with attitude *conformista and a fatalistic determinism that #would cause inevitably million unemployment of workers, it that coincided with moment chosen by the European Union for the fight *prioritaria against unemployment.
Like this as, lady Speaker -and according to the #french Academy is perfectly correct-, #would wish *felicitarla no only for having been chosen now Speaker of our Assembly, for the next years, but also for being the first woman that after twenty years, as *usted already has said it, has *sucedido like Speaker to my ancient colleague, Mrs. #Simone *Veil.
#would Wish also say to colleague #portuguese, *Mário *Soares, that congratulate it for having taken part in this election, for having given to the Assembly faculty to contest place, because in *eso consists the true political, the true democracy.
Lady Speaker, am here present for *rendir honours to powers with that Europeans have *revestido to Parliament and to offer my sincere wishes of collaboration to build a better future for citizens, but having present to time that also are part of the world, the *cual is of #all.
This perception *relativizó the particular national interests and generated in #all *Europa the will to advance a decisive step in the historical task to complete the #european integration.
Finally, see an enormous paradox in the election of yesterday by the right of this hemicycle of candidate totally *estimable, but #whose federalism is shown, *cuando, in reality, at all is #that -*me seems to me- the message directed by the constituents -and, in particular, by right constituents- in the #european countries.
Results very evident that said reform was and follow being a previous condition for negotiations that go to initiate in the World-wide Organisation of Trade, that is -well that we see it- an instrument in hands of the dominant economy, is to say, of the #american economy.
Wish to the new Parliament it better and also to the next new Commission, time happened the difficult audits -Commissioners and Commissioners still for appointing in the house of torture of the European Parliament freely chosen-, it that say of course of an ironic mood and, of course, only *retóricamente.
Specifically, #would want *darle graces in name of the Commission of Regional Politics and, of course, of the socialist deputies, by the glorious work made during the period in the reform process of the structural Bottoms.
#If in any moment *yo was not satisfied of how leave things, no will doubt in using powers that *me confers the Treaty until changing competitions and wallets, or in asking to each #one of Commissioners resignation.
Am convinced that the best way to reach this goal is to *través of method that the Community already used with hit in the past: in the first place ask to parts that cooperate among yes, that begin to work in common in questions of daily importance, that believe unions *aduaneras, that constitute common institutions and that affirm peace through common interests.
Believe that #that's why the Commission refused, for example, take out of the budget, assigned by reconstruction program *OBNOVA, some 45 millions of euros, to pay wages of the 700 persons that work for the Office of the High Representative for *Bosnia, it that *equivale to an amount of around 17 millions of euros of the 45 totals.
And in relation with the reform process of the absolutely necessary -Union, no only for enlargement but to take a more democratic Union and more effective-, lady Speaker, think that, of course, it that #can not take is a new Conference *intergubernamental to enclosed door.
will reach *recobrar confidence #if it will have more transparency, but especially #if it will have a greater respect to hour of *promulgar the directives, to the that they are cultures and the national peculiarities, #as well as a greater and more frequent resource to subsidiariness principle.
*Les #can ensure that it will be very important to keep a balance among the need of freedom of trade, that is #one the bases of *Europa, and the protection of the great rights, among the *cuales the right to health is a fundamental right.
security of persons do not resides only in that no have war, but also in the economic stability, in fulfillment of the human rights and in the protection offered by Right states.
Parliament begins work with a new squad and with new competitions conceded by the agreement of *Amsterdam, the previous Commission, that resigned in the middle of term of office, has to be substituted and, finally, in the Council are for the renewal of work methods.
In consequence, while the European Parliament *focalice attention only in the execution or no of president *Öcalan, without tackling in depth the question of self-determination of villages, will penetrate in the surface of the problem, but never will achieve to resolve it.
since we expect that *Turquía also #can be welcome in breast of the European Union inside #some years, no only *le ask that it suspend the execution of death pity of *Öcalan but also that it commission of the abolition of death pity in the country.
And *cuando there #be a neighbouring country and it same #would occur #if the problems, gentleman Commissioner, gave in *Hungría and it was necessary to create *algo in neighbour *Austria for the corresponding intervention the question is #if the *vecindad #can and has to be useful, and #if there #where there are problems the neighbouring countries #can really offer experience on it that occurs in the region.
#Such as it will have known the Assembly by reports of press, in said document specify some clear obligations for the future commissioners that propose to occupy *algún put during the back year to the termination of mandate to inform with time to the Commission of intentions.
Have been speaker in a considerable number of directives relative to liberalisation of the sector of telecommunications and so much *yo like my colleagues have acted of fine faith in this work and had taken for granted that the #ex Commissioner *Bangemann had taken it same.
Also wanted to take advantage of this opportunity for, in a context *algo wider, *darles to know a brief outline of #some plans and projects directed, firstly, to situate this case in a greater context, and, second, that this case *nos give reason for *reflexionar on it that we #would have to and have to improve in legislation on edible for animals and foods.
#Ours *Europa will not work, confidence in #ours *Europa will not work, #if we do not have the capacity to happen of coordination species of control to a true *comunitarización of, at least, part of these alimentary controls.
Because citizens and agriculturalists have right to expect of the Administration a suitable reaction in front of a crisis of this type, that maybe was not a natural phenomenon, but yes that *acerca a lot to *ello #if we consider #which have been effects.
do not want to signal to nobody, but, with evidence, have jumped preventive measures and have not taken into account the exhaustive controls that there #be in a so delicate field like the of the human alimentary chain.
More precisely, regarding the decisions taken, hail the reference to employment and to the decision of a «#european pact in favour of employment», *me see forced to express my dissatisfaction regarding assignments released and to the concrete proposals presented.
The vote of this resolution is a signal *reveladora of the will of the European Parliament to clear #all the details of this subject and answer to the legitimate worries of consumers.
In effect, have to foresee solutions in the short term to resolve the problems engendered by pollution of the alimentary products in *Bélgica and, to longer term, has to initiate a debate on numerous questions already mentioned during the crisis of cows crazy and that arise again because of this new alimentary crisis.
Was the *primer case in the community history in that it resorted to article 82 of the Treaty to penalise a discriminatory practice in damage of the interests of consumers, but that did not have a significant effect on the market.
fans to football and fans to sports now will know, with reason, that have the protection of the law, and the organisers of championships will know that *les will impose an authentic and strong sanction #if they break rule at present in vigour.
Along the almost #three hundred pages experts rush forward without compassion against the problems related with the management, control mechanisms, the fight against fraud, contracting politics of personnel and the business culture.
In this document #can read , for example, bottom criticism of propensity of the Commission -like the of administrations- to, quote: "act in his field according to his own logical, listening to determined *lobbies and without having sufficiently in account the consequences out of competition field" .
But the alone control of the European Parliament on the Commission will be insufficient by two reasons: firstly, because the European Parliament shares the goals of the Commission and, besides because #this is not subjected to pressure of the public opinion.
values that sustain the institution #would have to centre in an ethical of the fine management, in the assessment of money, in a clear communication, in merit and service to citizens and taxpayers of the European Union.
Without embargo, to sight of responsibility, that has been refused of *facto, results also difficult to take seriously the statements of commissioners to obey in the future resignation request of President of the Commission.
Is very interesting that the Expert Committee affirm in the final warning that the administration of the Community tends to *privilegiar the tasks of conception and of negotiation in detriment of management tasks and of control.
And thus, the Socialist Group is had to contribute, from the institutional responsibility that has to have Parliament, to a better operation of the community institutions, so much of Parliament as of the Commission, and demand it to the Council.
Rather by fortune that by a fine planning even there #be not had a big accident that have resulted in a radioactive spill produced by ship that transported radioactive materials, although it takes #some years sank ship that transported *hidrofluorido of uranium of *Francia to *Riga, although this registered that apparently they recovered containers without that produced spill.
The world is to a large extent poverty world, AIDS world, inside the that the *Europa that *esboza *usted is welfare island and of peace, based in knowledge, that still follows being dream far for human beings.
Gentleman President, the vote of Group, with the *cual deny backrest to the Commission, is not fruit of a *animadversión to persons, members of the Commission, and President, but fruit of the political assessment of programs.
The Commission will be strong #if it will be able to fulfil fully initiative function in accordance with Parliament that sues a greater participation in the preparation of the legislative proposals and an institutional relation constant with the Commission.
The answer is "at all" , because there #be not at all that it justify program to control the political life of nations of *Europa furtively, helped and induced by Government Bosses of States members, without forgetting to the of Realm Joined.
Regarding harmonisation measures that *le correspond, not even improve the situation in countries in the that legislation is more favourable for the hard-working classes and the disadvantaged categories or discriminated, mainly women and immigrant, since harmonisation, *cuando the there #be, takes by down.
#If we watch to the past, has taken upsetting in the collective responsibility. But when reading the report of the wise persons, the last report that finishes to appear, sees that practice has been very distinct.
On auditions, agree with Mr. *Corbett that it has been a good beginning, but there are things that have to improve *cuando go back to arise this subject in 2004, for example, the possibility that we make individual votes on Commissioner, after a vote in commission or at least *indicativa to know #if the commission was really in favour or no.
Mr. *Barnier finds in an optimum position to comprise, apply and move the regional politics, given his political experience is quality of national minister, but also like president of a regional assembly.
#Can that it was #that moment to introduce measures that the Committee of Independent Experts proposes, and that in the majority of the cases are measured of common sense that do not know why have not been already made.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, State Bosses and of Government took takes almost a year the initiative to summon an extraordinary meeting of the European Council that was devoted fundamentally to the realisation of a space of freedom, of security and justice.
By decision of Secretary and of the Spokesman of Parliament of *Finlandia *le has forbidden the entrance to the sessions of #the same, by indefinite time, to television reporter #finnish that took public some documents little *reveladores, provided by *algún deputy, on the *preparativos of the meeting of *Tampere.
The Presidency #finnish *nos has presented proposals. Lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, to this *respecto wanted to call attention on point that consider fundamental in the frame of the debate on the realisation of the space of security, freedom and justice.
In part, treats to build a *Europa strong, #whose need has been caused, #among others factors, by the own politics of the European Union; although mainly all turn around the fact that parts of the judicial culture are the central nervous system of democracies.
Lady Speaker, consider that in the resolution presented appear #all the assessments and the proposals that is timely that Parliament approve to end to offer his immediate contribution so as to that the Council of *Tampere begin to fulfil specifically the solemn promises taken to the #european citizens by the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Is important to struggle against the illegal immigration and against abuse of asylum laws, but the governments have to respect the obligations that have contracted in the frame of Gin Agreement and give asylum to the true refugees, and *tratarles with compassion and with dignity, instead of *temerlos as to demons.
Finally, wanted to express the wish that the debate that *ustedes go to celebrate today and morning with the Table of the Delegation of the European Parliament give fruit and that dialogue among our two parliaments continue prompt in the frame of the Mixed Parliamentary Delegation.
has not taken into account paper of the European Parliament like representative of the #european villages, in virtue of the *cual the catalogue of fundamental rights #would have to emanate of our institution. By #everything *eso, #can not accept function that *nos attributes.
Those who conform with little will say that at least *algo changes, but is important that *nosotros, deputies to the European Parliament, are ambitious and keep opened the possibility to incorporate the Letter in the Treaties and in a #european common Constitution of the that even #can be embryo.
In the Council of General Subjects of April of 1999 decide to ask to the Commission that prepare a program of economic performance and social to make possible the creation of the necessary institutions in *Timor Oriental.
The Union has demanded with firmness in moment that Indonesian take manager of order and of security, but alas, as we already have seen, the authorities of country have not fulfilled obligations in look.
Like European Parliament is obligation talk with an alone voice *cuando are in game fundamental decisions for the future of *Europa. The resolution #would have collected even more support #if #one of the Groups had had to disposal translation in language determined.
My conviction is the that *Europa will recover nobility letters in the opinion and charm of villages of the world when affirming clearly, in front of breaker *neoliberal, his own values and project.
trial will base in measure in that this Commission approximate *Europa more to village, confront with frauds and inefficiency inside his own services, and, especially, arm to *Europa to face up to offence, unemployment and the social exclusion.
Gentleman President, time that have seen that it foresaw to reassign #all the content of the *PRS 4 inside category 4, in view of that Parliament and the Council have decided to fund credits in the title *B-1 Agriculture, *me go to allow *desviarme a bit because my problem are not the *PRS.
Because here the Commission *nos says literally that, although we already have taken finance effort with reallocation, is necessary an amount of 570,5 millions more, that the Commission proposes to reassign in the global transfer or in a complementary transfer in this exercise.
deputy of Parliament that was not familiarised with function of #Washington in the tragedies of Indonesian and of *Timor from 1966 until the last genocide *perpetrado by soldiers on 30 August, #would have to read the analysis published today by the #Washington *Post and the *Herald *Tribune in first page: "The Pentagon says that the military contacts with Indonesian are useful" .
Is evident that it is necessary to exert international pressure on Indonesian and #many of *nosotros have asked that it suspend already the financial assistance of the World-wide Bank and of the International Monetary Bottom and that suspend the exports of arms and the military cooperation.
do not believe that it was appropriate in #all the cases that Europeans react in military plan in front of crisis that take place in zones very far of borders, but the crisis of *Timor oriental has put of relief difficulties with that trip Europeans to answer to a new task of maintenance of peace.
While we talk here, the Security Council of Nations Joined has approved a resolution with arrangement to Chapter 7 of the Letter of Nations Joined that allows that maintenance strength of peace under control #australian go to *Timor oriental.
Perhaps #would have to reconsider now this definition and promote an international debate to determine #if democracies like the #ours have to give equality of recognition, deal and *respetabilidad to diets of #everyone that *deniegan democracy and right State, the human rights and the fine public management.
The main candidate of the Party *Socialdemócrata in the #european elections, #Pierre *Schori, affirmed also that exists a fundamental difference among it that the EU designates an effective management of the crisis and a common defence.
In the conclusions of the European Council of Colony *recalca that the creation of a #european politics of security and of defence presupposes the whole participation and in equal conditions of #all States members, included the neutral militarily, in operations of the European Union.
Although it have #any request of word, have to apply the rules of the game, and in article 4 of the annex *II of the Regulation says that deputy will be able to formulate, in question turn to the Council, only a complementary question.
Subject: Suppression of the use of lenses of contact of multiple use in experimental stage Determined reports of press appeared in June affirmed that, in Big *Bretaña, had recommended to the optical suppress the use of contact lenses of multiple use in experimental stage by fear to that they #can transmit a new variant of illness *Creutzfeldt-#Jakob.
Gentleman President, believe that the medical specialists and the optical know perfectly #which are the risks that #can cause contact lenses, but, as well we know, the Commission is attendant to study the evolution of the situation in practice.
But in spite of *eso, runs the voice that it #can get to deal; is to say, the relative transitory periods to the free market of work and other similar subjects of the EU #can link to transitory periods in the countries candidates to adhesion.
Obviously, is a far country, but no thus it leaves to be true that the valid diet is literally criminal; the Union #would have to devote to demolish diet; of it contrary, *nos will see forced, as in the case of *Kosovo or of other regions, to use the great means.
But in the case of *Corea of the North the problem resides in that the country is *herméticamente isolated of the rest of societies of the world and, therefore, is *extremamente difficult take get information to country, #if well it #would be to wish that like this it occurred.
Gentleman President, as a result of the recent decision of the Council on the lifting of sanctions in relation with the crisis of *Kosovo, the Commission has presented the proposal to exonerate to *Kosovo and *Montenegro of the special sanctions of the *CE against the ancient Republic of *Yugoslavia.
Is comprehensible that today are the economic reconstruction of *Kosovo, that without embargo, is directly connected with political suitabilities of States members, and also with effort of these last for distributing bottoms allocated to reconstruction of *Kosovo among companies of States members.
And #this to say that no treats of research question of a previous control on character of the global help proposal, in spite of that the amount of #the same, 1.900 millions of euros in the next 5 years, like this #would advise it.
The European Union, that beyond all doubt has a main paper in the solution of the problems, has acted correctly when deciding extend the regulation, especially creating reconstruction service of the region.
Is clear that the mandate of the agency do not includes assistance in the #others countries of the ancient *Yugoslavia neither in countries #balkan, because this structure is the specific instrument of the European Union for reconstruction of *Kosovo.
disputes that *ocasionan delays are obviously inadmissible, had account of the need to find a fast solution to the problem and, therefore, the Commission is opened to commitment agreement that respect rapidity goals and efficiency.
Therefore, wanted to ask: #can transmit wish to the Conference of Presidents that in the future, #if it goes back to celebrate a debate in the that it exist conflict with the Council, #this organise of form that the Council was present and #can give a direct clash?
To concede to #both the opportunity of *recapacitar and to get to a better understanding of the subject and reach to continuation together with *nosotros a greater efficiency, request the return of the final vote to the Commission of External Subjects.
It more surprising of manipulation is attitude of the Council: during #all negotiation of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, had resisted *encarnizadamente to the *reagrupamientos, in a special title of the Treaty, of #all the rights of citizens, *dispersos in said text.
Likewise, supply program of foods to *Rusia, launched this same year, is subject to a narrow surveillance that, among things, includes controls of utilisation of bottoms generated by sale of products alimentary in the local markets.
The past November was in *Moscú with group of Parliament, that displaced to country to evaluate the need of humanitarian help, and #can check that the country simply is not in conditions to put order in subjects.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, perhaps have reason to remember that in *Rusia have occurred things. More of 5000 nuclear heads have been taken out of circulation, In *Rusia have created democratic institutions and #this possesses media that are able to criticise to the Government and have value to take it.
Without embargo, to finish, estimated colleagues, wanted to take out to collation a question that also have posed #some of colleagues, to know, the need to create investigation centre for the study investigation and systematic application of new methods of prevention of the earthquakes.
Gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, estimated colleagues, news of Sunday happened about convictions to death for the four persons that took part in the student disorders of the summer in will Go created a wave of indignation and repudiate in village *iraní and in the rest of the world.
To continuation, the preparation and application by a military commission joined that it has to be previous to the establishment of peace strength; and #this has to, to time, occupy of disarmament of #all militias armed and to prepare the national reconciliation.
At present journalists follow working in conditions no totally optimum; therefore I consider timely, for example, transfer of press hall perhaps under the hemicycle, since the current hall continues being too much far and often is not easy for journalists come to talk with deputies, especially with occasion of important sessions.
This morning *les take the promise -*sobreentendiéndose that no *les #can promise it impossible: #can not *prometerles that go to have of planes #all days for *llevarles to capitals and vice versa- that I will take all it that it #can, with cooperation of the mayor and of the competent authorities, to improve of appreciable form the situation also in look.
Gentleman President, in my *primer speech in front of this House *me had enjoyed to talk of the adjust electronic of elevator row to increase like this efficiency, of ventilation in services, of the air conditioned and of the carpets totally *insulsas that there #be in the bar.
Also regret monitor fault of TV in bar zones and restaurants that #would have to be to disposal of deputies that take pause to take coffee so that they #can follow the course of the debate and, #if they have to take part, so that they #can measure adequately entrance in the Hemicycle.
Gentleman *Prodi, go to *citarle an example that *usted definitely will comprise very well: this principle has to be so important for the Union and has to have a so high priority like the that has, for example, the criterion of price stability for the Central Bank European.
In spite of *ello, along the last diverse years States members have seen forced to face up to odd forms of intoxication alimentary and hardly have of mechanisms of susceptible control to prevent that industry of foods introduce type of *desperdicios and waste in chain alimentary.
Believe that *Europa has to assume part of responsibility that *le corresponds in this subject. #would Have to help economically to the small agriculturalists and to the other agricultural employers that have been victims of *algo that in mood is not but derailment of the #european agricultural politics.
Definitely, the debate celebrates today, and since we are here and have heard to gentleman President *Prodi, have been able to sure enough take in consideration it that *nos announces, is to say, the creation of an independent #european agency, research with character *prioritario of the alimentary security, the reinforcement of controls, etc.
slimes contain heavy metals, #among others, considerable quantities of cadmium, and precisely thus in my country and in general in the #nordic countries residue #can not disseminate by the arable surfaces, because cadmium goes in in chain alimentary and through #this in persons.
Gentleman President, since it debated two years ago the Green Book of foods, expect that it conclude the White Book, that will include, expect, the concrete initiatives and responsibilities of the #european politics in the alimentary field.
In our opinion, the deep cause is that the social system puts the benefit by on even of health of persons. Especially *cuando treats of the benefits of the great companies and of health of workers.
Lady Speaker, Commissioner *Prodi, Commissioner *Byrne, the crisis of the *EEB and of dioxin, together with the current controversy relative to the genetically modified foods, have combined to undermine gravely confidence of consumers in the *inocuidad of foods.
Gentleman President, at the beginning of the years eighty, *cuando the first alarming #news on AIDS seeded panic in *Europa and States Joined, prognoses about the scope and the social implications of illness purchased some catastrophic dimensions.
treats especially of young adults economically active that, in cases, have to charge to #all family. Said of mood, AIDS affects mainly to generation that in the majority of the countries constitutes the vertebral column of society.
In the frame of the principle of sanitary caution, the European Union will have to therefore defend the application of this right to the compulsory licences in the Round of #Millenium.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, with more of 2 millions of dead persons to the year and 4 millions of new infected in the #african continent, and with certainty that the 70% of new *seropositivos registers in the #african continent, how doubt fits that *nos find in front of pandemia that is the first cause of death for citizens of a #african country.
*Irlanda of the North is in the periphery of this Union and is a peripheral part of the Union and, even so, are the beginning of a terrible propagation in country, related to a large extent with drug traffic.
#can not, especially because a series of States members have decided to break with the nuclear politics, with politics of fission, accept that the Union like #such continue funding politics of the nuclear energy until four times more that #others.
Together with *ALTERNER and investigation on renewable energy in the *Quinto Program Mark, that expect that it was very important, need the adoption of measures collateral urgent, #such as the directive on access to network for the market of electricity.
The White Book *infundió hopes and are desirous that it set up the exciting campaign with million of photovoltaic facilities, his big farm with aeolian energy, biomass and -it more exciting of #all- his 100 communities in the that #all electricity will proceed of renewable energy.
In the first place, *me seems that the available quantity is too much small and, second, #if we expect duplication of the quantity of renewable energy, #would have to have a marked increase in bottom quantity assigned for time period.
Has a very scarce budget and, therefore same, Group receives *favorablemente the proposal of the speaker to increase resources of program *SAVE in 4,4 millions of euros, until reaching a total of 68,4 millions of euros.
Regarding a last subject that *me had remained in inkwell, that is the participation of #some countries of the centre and east of *Europa, wanted to say that, in actuality, there are ten countries that are of programs *SAVE to incite to an improvement in the energetic efficiency.
Here is the supplementary illustration of the collusion among the Commission and Parliament for *desposeer to the #european Council of it that to trial is of his exclusive competition, is to say, the external politics.
Was the fight of the #black masses the that imposed the end of segregation institutionalised, but #this have not been able to unfortunately put end to the social segregation that takes that workers and the unemployed of this country follow living in misfortune.
Like this and #everything, bottom philosophy, *me seems the following: there are #some subjects that prejudice or go against of competition and that, in consequence, have to be harmonised deeply; #others, instead, with regard to the *cuales harmonisation, in my opinion, #would be hurtful, thing that do not occurs in the current States that even allow diversity among regions.
This figure, that includes to 350.000 refugees of *Croacia and *Bosnia-*Herzegovina, 120.000 displaced #serbian and #gipsy interns of *Kosovo and 300.000 unprotected socially, has been reckoned by evaluation squad conjoint for help alimentary of the *ACNUR and of the World-wide Program of Foods, that visited the Federal Republic of *Yugoslavia in July of this year.
The most unprotected groups of Serbian find in these institutions, and the THROW wants to loan support that was necessary in form of additional alimentary help -fundamentally help alimentary will deliver to *través of the World-wide Bank of Foods- and besides wants to complete it with articles that are not foods and heating.
In the frame of this analysis, take in consideration the resolution of December Parliament of 1998, #as well as the conclusions of the Presidency of the Council after the two informal meetings of ministers commissioned of sport.
To me *me #would enjoy to ask to Mrs. Commissioner #if, to achieve our goal, #would not be better *aunar #all strengths and, with backrest of #all States members, present an only #european candidature like headquarters for this International Agency against Doping.
Create, and disagree a bit of *usted regarding the last part of answer, that the important signals that gives the European Union in other regions of the world, but that are very near of Indian, thanks to the organisation of events like the summits, have to be countered.
The #european employers, the #european political class, the #european public opinion, to the equal that the of Indian, need an important signal, that #can not be another that a summit.
Further of #all #this, *yo wanted to add, without embargo, to finish that we follow considering necessary a deep reform in this field and the Commission has foreseen to present, therefore, before end of year a proposal to reform amply subvention system and of organisation of the markets in the sector of linen and hemp.
Now are not in the #spanish Parliament, not even in the assembly of the region that has been mentioned, but in the European Parliament and #can not prejudge neither know in advance criterion and respect right of expression of ladies and gentlemen deputies.
The main obstacle for entry of *Turquía is inability to fulfil the political criteria established in *Copenhague, especially regarding democracy, the human rights and the rights of minorities, in particular of village *kurdo.
#If we advance in the proposal of the Commission and of the Council, #can *ustedes be safe that diet of *Turquía do not goes to advance to democratisation, will strengthen in continuing and worsen the inadmissible politics, inhuman current that is #as well as provocations against #Grecia and against humanity.
Here includes for example the requirement to take seriously no only *verbalmente the financial commitments of the European Union in front of *Turquía on the base of the financial protocol, but also the to put to disposal the corresponding bottoms.
vicinity of term to fulfil an intermediate stage of the peace process, established for 4 May of the present year in the agreement of *Oslo, took that the situation went even more unsure.
The situation in Orient Next is still far of #this, but no fits doubt that the election like prime minister of *Ehud #Barak in #Israel and the peaceful option of the Palestinians have offered an opportunity to peace: show it the recent progresses of the agreements of *Oslo in version modified of *Sharm-the-*Sheikh.
The authentic difficulties will appear in the frame of negotiations on the final situation, that includes the contentious subject of *Jerusalén, control on the rights of water and the return of refugees.
Without embargo, this agreement has a considerable political significance: marks the unblock of the peace process, after stagnation years and even of deterioration during the government of *Netanyahu, that never had accepted the logic of *Oslo.
Lady Speaker, once again, with occasion of the vote on the calendar of partial periods of sessions for the year 2000, have had to face up to a round of amendments with seen to reduce the length of the partial periods of sessions in *Estrasburgo.
In effect, as it has remembered Mr. *Dell' #Alba to the principle of turn, with the participation in the votes, do not think to endorse a situation that in fact discriminates to millions of #european citizens, to #whose representatives *les denies the full exercise of his parliamentary mandate.
In effect, had explains that saving energetic on consumption has improved up to now around the 1% annual, the European Commission *preconiza a supplementary reduction of point of saving percentage on the final demand.
Is true that *Turquía #would have to, in look, satisfy the criteria fixed by the European Council of *Copenhague, among the *cuales appear the existence of stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the human rights and respect to minorities.
do not go to vote in favour of the common resolution on course of relations European Union - *Turquía because in *ella there are reasonings and political contradictions, #as well as a fine dose of hypocrisy, things that are not own of a serious institution like Parliament.
debate the statements of the Council and of the Commission on the opening of the Round of #Millenium in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade of 30 November until 3 December in *Seattle.
These countries fear that negotiation of the labour rights minima in breast of the *OMC was an attempt to take part in his low labour costs and, therefore, in advantage relative in look.
progresses have to allow reconcile the demographic growth and the economic growth with endowment limited of natural resources, since it is the technical progress it that moves away border of the durable utilisation of resources.
Likewise, hits obtained by the countries industrialised and the emergent economies of #Asia -because of liberalisation of exchanges-, have taken *tambalear confidence of the communist diets and have conducted to his radical transformation in *Europa and #Asia.
Finally, globalisation reflects the perceptions of the coming generations, the of the next century, that, through the media and of his own *peregrinar, live the world like a *aldea #where the *interdependencia promotes solidarity and #where expresses taste by difference and confluence.
norms refer, firstly, to investment and to competition, two questions in front of the *cuales partners doubt, by very diverse reasons, and that, because of the precedent of the *AMI, arouse reservations and resistances by part of countries in roads of development, *cuando no a radical hostility in #some of organisations no governmental.
Is a very dangerous path, as they show it already the consequences of the application of norms of the *OMC, with the aggravation of the social inequalities, of unemployment and of poverty in the world.
For example, still have not seen the benefits for the textile sector and of preparation, neither neither have seen benefit of liberalisation of trade of agricultural products.
By the contrary, in the majority of the countries of the European Union, concentration of CO2 has not taken more that grow regarding levels of 1990; therefore, will need drastic additional measures to fulfil with the agreements of *Kioto.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, lady Speaker in exercise of the Council, it is necessary *agradecerles to *ustedes that they have coincided in the majority of points with the resolution of the European Parliament, that collects neither more neither less that the philosophy of the European Parliament regarding the climatic change.
intervention in control of the crisis is in accordance with the military neutrality of #some States members. In the conclusions of Colony meeting said explicitly that the Union will not take part in the solutions adopted by States members in matter of defence.
Gentleman President, the Presidency #finnish has prepared enlargement of the qualified majority *enviándoles to States members a questionnaire, in the that it asks in how fields are had still to enable the qualified majority in the taking of decisions.
In the *primer paragraph of article 29 of the statutes of the Central Bank European regulate the criteria of cast of subscriptions of capital of #the same, according to the *cuales the Bank of *Dinamarca #would have to contribute with a 1,6709 percent of the own capital of #ECB.
On the other hand, the Council neither has received still any proposal to apply the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna (*ICCAT) against overexploitation of species.
. (*FI) Gentleman President, the Council has a positive attitude to the possibilities that offer in the field of the fight against the social marginalisation contemplated in paragraph 2 of article 137 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, after the entrance in vigour of #the same.
Only wanted to ask, in view of supply problems, #if the Commission goes to urge to #Georgia to that it build the 700 *m of road that are missing until border *chechena, that did not build owing to the #russian pressures, so that in the future the humanitarian help #can reach border *chechena.
The Code has improved the mutual understanding about politics of States members, has established an effective mechanism of query and has boosted dialogue about the application of disposals.
Gentleman President, the fight against death pity in the world is first of all a fight of civilisation by this right of humanitarian interference that is step in the world-wide consciousness.
Demand to the #indonesian Government that put end to violence and that believes the necessary conditions so that, also *nosotros, from the European Union, #can help of suitable form to repair damages and to loan the necessary humanitarian help.
will Be especially important #if Parliament achieves to exert an appropriate political paper and concrete, so as to contribute to launch new light on this dark event and to take justice to the 81 victims and to families that from takes more of 19 years are to know that it occurred, why and #who are managers.
In the European Union, the national authorities of States members have to demand of companies that inform to apprentices and workers that #can remain exposed to radiations, of the dangers for health that comports work and that *les qualify in the protection *radiológica.
In effect, the "right of contaminating" #can not buy , and a simple payment or exchange #can not release to the richest to take #all the possible efforts to respect the common law.
Lady Speaker, for my Group this agreement *interinstitucional is stone angular for the *restablecimiento of the credibility of the European Union regarding form to occupy of frauds and of the bad financial management.
The agreement *interinstitucional *nos carries even more far in another direction as it #would impose to #all deputies and to personnel the obligation to use the appropriate procedures to inform to the future services of *OLAF, so that complaint of fraud #can be investigated adequately.
Celebrate can contribute in my first oral intervention, like recent member of this High Assembly, to a fine part of the #european legislation and wish that produce a wide compliance here and a fluent approval of the directive in the Council of Ministers.
Expect that in the vote that #be to make affirm with strength the will of Parliament to open immediately the path to disposal that will allow immediately a greater visibility, a greater transparency and a greater access of citizens to our democratic life.
In point urges to the Commission to that it go in in contact with third countries and with international organisations with a view to find suitable solutions To this *respecto it will be necessary to take into account of special way how proposed develop in this field the Commission of Nations Joined for the International Mercantile Right (*CNUDMI), the *OCDE and the *OMC.
*Yo celebrate can signal also in my first oral intervention in Plenary of this Assembly that in my own homeland; *Austria, transport facilities by wire constitute an angular stone of tourism and, therefore, of the national economy.
Therefore, *yo *me *congratulo that among Parliament, the Council and the Commission exist an absolute consensus, an absolute coincidence, regarding the will to put to disposal the necessary credits for *Kosovo with charge to the Budget of the EU.
*Yo believe that the #european taxpayers #would not comprise that they demanded simply additional bottoms to fund costs in *Kosovo, without visiting to time the difficult path of the definition of priorities, or was, precisely, of redistribution of credits.
The *multifuncionalidad of agriculture in the fields of feeding, the conservation of the landscape, the protection of nature and also of tourism like sector of employment with perspectives of future, that surely will not contract but that will follow growing, constitutes an important worry for #all Parliament.
manifested numerous discrepancies: in the first place, regarding the *IFOP; second, regarding support of the Council and of States members to Politics *Pesquera Common, especially regarding the international agreements of fishing, as in the recent case of the Agreement with *Marruecos; and, in *tercer place, on relations of the EU with other international organisations.
Through measures of support directed specifically to women in the frame of population politics and of development will be able to contribute to create a more social base stable, to transformation of the existent structures and to development of other new.
With the statements of Mrs. *Schreyer in the sense that it will procure to redistribute cost, resort in lower measure to security reservation and modify perhaps the Financial Perspectives, the Commission has given a *primer step of approximation to the positions of Parliament.
The position of Parliament is unanimous. Need a review limited of the Financial Perspectives so that no *nos see forced to go out of the step time with a series of complementary budgets and *rectificativos, as it has occurred this year.
Second, regarding the external politics, specifically regarding *Kosovo, audience that organise takes days with the Commission of External Subjects and Budget Commission to me *me resulted very *reveladora, especially the fact that #this was not commitment in the short term.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the report (To5-0035\/1999) of Mr. *Huhne, in name of Commission of Economic Subjects and Monetary, on the annual report 1998 of the Central Bank European (*C4-0211\/1999).
Like this, whereas the Treaty demands that #ECB publish a quarterly report on activities, #ECB has decided to publish said report *mensualmente with the Monthly Bulletin, in the that it takes exhibition detailed of the economic and monetary evolution.
The publication by part of report #ECB detailed of country that takes part in the zone of the euro #would go against of the necessary creation of a perspective of #all the zone when developing, debate and think the monetary politics.
Therefore, an indispensable condition to achieve a substantial improvement in the processing of payments to the by minor *transfronterizos is definitely that the banking sector establish some common characteristics for the processing among the banks.
*Yo urge to #ECB to that it contribute of constructive way to hit of the Pact in favour of growth and employment, and that express with clarity how proposes to take part in dialogue *macroeconómico to contribute to the definition of a combination of politics balanced.
#All the central or international banks of the great countries owe, in #one or form, to this democratic responsibility in front of the socioeconomic community, in the #anglo-saxon countries to *través of Parliament, in *Alemania through the Banks *federados of the *Länder.
Gentleman President, Parliament receives in day of today to President of the Central Bank European, is to say, president of the first institution to the *cual the #european nations - did not knows why disorder - have decided to entrust, give a sovereign power, at least eleven of *ellas.
Without doubt, *usted will have after all more can or influence that *ellos, although it was less brilliant, since in #millenium end that seems *erigir to money like last universal value, is *usted *detentando the temporary power and the spiritual power in breast of the European Union.
What greater was equality in level of distribution of information in society, greater will be efficiency with that individual options orient development of the economy and the invisible hand of the market.
In the Low Countries made a study of the economic institute of small and medium enterprise, the *EIM, of the that definitely will agree. Have ascertained that the retail trade will have to have available a 100% of volume of daily sales in coins of change, in front of the 7 % current.
Going back to the current situation, wanted to repeat that the strategy of monetary politics of the system of the Euro, that has presented very clearly in front of Parliament, bases in two *pilares, both designed with future horizon on the half term.
Wish that know, gentleman President, that will give support to #all efforts that go directed to finish with the terrorist actions, to control strengths *paramilitares and to sign the supremacy of the civil power on the military power.
Need to build a new nation in #where respect of the human rights, the application of justice and reconstruction of our social tissue are the solid foundations that *nos allow to conform society in the that factors generators of violence eradicate once and for all.
The Commission supports the clear affirmation of the importance of prevention in the fight against delinquency, already was financial, urban or juvenile, and sees recognised management so that they stood out in particular the rights of the victims of the criminal activities.
#If well it is true that #can have finished worse, #a lot of worse, especially for citizens of the third countries that find in *Europa or that aspire to come to *ella pushed by the need, #this no removes that it has lost a fine occasion to begin to build specifically a space of freedom, justice and security.
There #where States members no longer #can go more far as they have got to the limit of possibilities goes in in action the Union -in asylum politics, in the of migration, in the fight against crime organised and in cooperation with justice.
On immigration, believe that *Tampere represents an important stage, when integrating it that we #can call a strategy of *codesarrollo, is to say, when recognising that, to resolve the question of immigration, it will be necessary to tackle fully the causes that originate refugee phenomenons.
Gentleman President, seat the bases of the creation of a #european space of freedom, security and justice was the goal of the European Council of *Tampere, an important goal because it affects to the fundamental values of our western civilisation.
Wanted to insist, in name of my Group, in that they apply fully, in #all looks, the principles of Gin Convention in the two slopes of migration politics, and that the Commission and Parliament are entirely involved in #all looks.
In *Tampere has produced mutation *cuasiconstitucional, because the Council has given a mandate to the Commission to establish, to #his proposal, common norms for admission and stay, for lawsuits of small quantity, and for #many other questions.
advances reached will be no only acts of the Council, of the Commission and of the European Parliament, but also of States members in measure in that *les entrust tasks of bookmark in virtue of subsidiariness principle.
This proposal, combined with the maintenance of the monopoly of initiative of the Commission, *propiciaría, as we know, a considerable strengthening of powers of this last and a correlated reduction of the right of States.
Recognises -thing that *nosotros have said always- that cooperations reinforced of the Treaty of *Amsterdam #can not serve at all to resolve the double program of the every time greater heterogeneity and the total impossibility to abandon powers of sovereignty to procedures of decision by qualified majority and, more still, in a *Europa of thirty States or more.
The social dimension of the European Union, a previous condition for a #european democracy, neither mentions with an alone word in this report of the Council of the Wise persons.
After which will have still work, among 10 November and the beginning of negotiation, since the Commission will have to present a document of the that *yo same have said that it #would be a solid political document, global, structured so that it was useful to the negotiators and facilitate negotiation.
Also is true that our goal is it that before have called intelligent restructuring and there are three characteristic elements that companies have taken into account; because in the past, in the European Union, have cases of the two forms of behaviour that have mentioned previously.
But #all know that, in this period, legislation alone or legislation in #if same #can not solve the *tremendo problem of restructuring of industry, especially *cuando the #european industry did not has to only compete inside borders, but that it has to take part and face up with hit to the world-wide competition.
Finally, in #day of the start of negotiations of the *OMC, wish to underline the need that *Europa affirm his political wills, also in matter of industrial politics, and plant in the centre of *ellas "employment, the creation of wealth, development of the territories".
By part, my Group goes to direct to the main #sindical organisations #european to exchange experiences and, got the case, launch a #european request that allow to our *conciudadanos influence in the future decisions.
*Me refer also to thousands of workers of companies like *Michelin that have invested time, energies, knowledges, aptitudes, hopes and aspirations, in addition to the of families, in company in the that have worked during *tantos years.
In any case, #would want *asegurarles that the continuous communication with Employment Commission and Social Subjects, and with the commission of companies, will help continuously to the Commission to carry to good new term essential interventions and it more flexible possible in this sector.
Like this as, the European Union has regretted deeply that State Senate Joined, in decision of 13 October, have refused the Treaty of total prohibition of nuclear proofs.
The Commission shares disappointment that finishes to express President of the Council in front of rejection by part of the American Senate of the Treaty of total prohibition of the nuclear proofs.
Among the arguments adduced in States Joined, #some considered that it had not got moment to renounce the nuclear essays, *cuando results that *Corea of the North deploys efforts to endow of his own arms and Chinese follows developing arsenal.
It that *nosotros criticise deeply is attitude of the republican majority in the Senate that answers more to it that it was *otrora the doctrine of the "self-evident destination" of States Joined, much more that the of the moral leadership, in addition to the military, that have in this moment.
Hail the initiative of President #Jacques *Chirac, of the Federal Chancellor #Gerhard *Schröder and of Prime minister #Tony *Blair, those who have directed in an open letter to the North American public opinion in *pro of ratification of the Treaty *CTBT.
The European Union aptly is the opportunities of the #russian companies to export to the markets of the European Union to promote the #russian economy.
In this sense, took greater #granting and accepted a minimum number of three States participants in the *coorganización of concrete projects and of five States participants in the agreements of cultural cooperation and of big *envergadura and procured to find road of a greater *flexibilización of organisation devices.
#There is infinity of agents and cultural operators that will remain *desprovistos of means class for action that carry out, and #whose value is invaluable, #if it did not concludes this file before the end of the common year to end to allow the entrance in vigour of program already at the beginning of the next year.
The informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and with the Commission allow to expect that it get here to a unification of criteria, as youngsters and associations expect that performance and relation among the institutions was not bureaucratic but pragmatic.
In the session of day 23 July, President of Parliament proposed to the commission that chair the examination of bottom, and in the meeting of 27 July, the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media And Sport *me appointed speaker.
Nevertheless, since bottom of this proposal " only" is to limit help period of 5 to 3 years, there #be time to examine #if *Eurostat and the national institutes of statistical #can satisfy data needs and statistical informations.
As *usted will comprise, gentleman President, do not have intention to go in in the details of the amendments presented by Parliament, but *me pleases *comunicarle that the Commission shares the interest to guarantee hit of small and medium enterprises, by it that accepts the relative amendment to #the same.
In the frame of the budgetary procedure, although we opt by a period of five years, Parliament has #all the years the possibility to take modifications, to interrupt payments, is to say, of sanctioning, #if it results necessary.
Lady Speaker, during the conclusion of my intervention in the debate of yesterday on restructuring of companies, signalled to Vice-president that chaired the session that had produced anomaly in the conjoint resolution that go to vote later today.
Memory very well that in the Conference of Presidents -the colleagues that are here to my right definitely will agree, *Pat *Cox, Mrs. *Hautala, my colleague Baron *Crespo and #others more- argue on the question of #if we talked of *Michelin or of globalisation and restructuring of companies in general.
And *yo, therefore, ask to Speaker that have a rigorous control in the register in relation with modifications no authorised of the proposals, which is a problem, in my opinion, of modification and of falsity in public document of Parliament.
there #be not form of *reintroducir, from sight point of the procedure, the amendment of Mrs. *Scallon, since no exists commitment base to present an oral amendment.
Besides, in place to pose the political conditions that invariably posed the European Parliament, limits to quotation of the "Comments" to an institutional mechanism of control of doubtful effectiveness, as experience with program *Meda has come putting of self-evident.
Results particularly important that loan special attention to the granting of any type of supports to companies, that always have to be conditioned to the maintenance of employment, and have to establish severe sanctions and force to the return of assignments, *cuando was not like this.
Every time that the European Parliament tackles #this and other questions, *me give account that it treats of a field of action that requires measured to scale #european. Is the case of the railway and is the case of the transport of dangerous commodities.
Gentleman President, want, in the first place, appreciate to Mr. *Hatzidakis, speaker and president of Transport Commission, Regional Politics and Tourism, the excellent report that has made on modification proposal of the Directive mark relative to the transport of dangerous commodities by railway.
Is true, as it says, that in #some zones of network *nos find with a situation of overload, with infrastructures that are already very used and very taken advantage of fundamentally in the transport of persons, that is the that in these moments has the priority in politics of the railway in #all States members.
And, to #that *respecto, #can not leave to underline error that constituted, takes four or five years, the *concertación of fishing agreement out of the widest frame of cooperation agreement *concertado among the European Union and *Marruecos.
Have happened years and neither Commissioner *Bonino neither Commissioner *Fischler neither the respective ministers have had diligence neither the necessary agility so that no were here it that we have to take in front of a hurtful event, *cuando is missing month so that it produce.
Far of *oponer among himself\/hisself the interests of workers of the sector *pesquero of the #european countries and of the #african countries, is necessary to look for convergence concerning claims and of fight in front of the powerful capitalist interests.
But to time have to get it before possible to a reasonable agreement that take into account the interests in matter of environment and external politics and of security and that do not commit error to introduce demagogic elements that *desestabilicen to neighbours. Have to avert that *nos drop bandage of the eyes *cuando was too much late, as *sucedió in the *Balcanes or in the *Cáucaso!
treats of: application of slaughtering plan selective; introduction of identification of animal effective and of register system and of movements that already applies completely; legislation for the elimination of meat and meat with bone of factories of *piensos and of the agricultural establishments.
This House, through Investigation Commission on the *EEB, and the European Commission were the that recommended measures that now are to guarantee security in #all the European Union of those who consume #british products and #british meat.
Is paramount that base our decisions in scientific proofs, and #if today the majority of scientists thinks that it #can raise the prohibition to export meat of bovine #british, expect that the #french authorities act inside #few days, and expect that the Commission undertake the pertinent legal actions, #if it do not occurs it expected.
This endemic persistence poses a fearsome question, the to know #if no exist transmission moods of illness that the that detected up to now: feeding with animal flours and the maternal transmission.
charge of the sufficient scientific proof that weighs on instance concerned for protecting health of population brakes or prevents in practice the application of the principle of caution.
Gentleman President, after the excellent interventions of Gentlemen *Souchet and *Martinez in favour of the maintenance of the #french embargo on the bovine meat #british, only wanted to add three reflections from sight point juridical, morals and politician.
Going back to the specific case, consider that Parliament do not has to ask to the Commission that investigate the existence of recommendations formulated by the national Agencies managers of the alimentary security against of the community decisions.
Believe that the Commission is a good work, but our fundamental worry in this moment is the maintenance of activity *pesquera and, in concrete, of activity in the that no have *sobrexplotación, but conservation of the natural resources.
From *Marruecos *nos get #news that fishermen #moroccan, with big despair, see the immense damage that takes to fish banks, so only to resupply to the #european markets of sardines and other common species of the that depend the same lives of *ellos and families.
Therefore, gentleman Commissioner, in this question and in the that refers to fishing agreements in general, as it put of self-evident yesterday in the important debate that kept in relation with fishing Agreement with *Marruecos, always will have the favourable opinion, in general majority, of Fishing Commission, and expect that the follow having of Parliament.
In the first reading of this concrete proposal Parliament did not take amendments, but the speaker, #Hugh *McMahon in moment, formulated observation that it was absolutely essential that these three instruments went in in vigour to time to avert any disadvantage in matter of competition.
Expect that Transport Council loan attention to this message and have #some advances to reach that transport by road remain comprised; of it contrary, see a real danger for the rail sector to consequence of the review of the general directive.
#If the speaker believed timely to propose that it postpone said Agreement, the Commission of External Subjects #would support fully a proposal in this sense that, to sight of war of *Chechenia, *nos seems that it #would be a reasonable measure to take upsetting in this question.
Since the Popular Republic of Chinese has chamber of the world-wide population and has a big economic potential, is very important implication in the #european investigation and in the technological projects.
The technical backrest to favour energy-efficiency, energy saving and the sources of energies clean and renewable will allow that Chinese reduce CO2 broadcasts.
By it that refers to biotechnology questions, have to answer to Mr. *Gahrton that #all investigation proposals in the sphere of biotechnologies have to satisfy *imperativamente the applicable ethical conditions to project of program-mark.
Therefore, in line and sharing worries of Parliament on the gravity of the situation in *Chechenia, neither create -and comprise perfectly the position of His *Señorías to #that *respecto- that this agreement was the best half to manifest interests and questions in front of it that is *sucediendo.
Since this year it celebrates the second centenarian of trip of #Alexander *von *Humboldt to *Venezuela, *yo wanted to remember that *Humboldt no only contributed *algo, specifically eagerness to know, but that also returned with *algo to *Europa, specifically with knowledge on the tropical plants and on geography of this interesting continent.
That, in spite of the practical more ecological that #can introduce #one or more States members, apply it that appears in the directive of the most uniform form possible, and that no exist an excess of bureaucracy for manufacturers or for sale points in this context.
Are adherents that it have actions no legislative, as many times it is not necessary legislation since, sometimes, suffices with the *soft *law, but these initiatives do not owe *hacernos lose of sight that it is necessary to avert a false idea of harmonisation, it is necessary to avert the juridical insecurity, #as well as the false expectations on the inner market.
Parliament finds in a fine position to set up discussion on this type of initiatives. Especially, maybe, for giving to know worries of citizen half, to the one who, perhaps, no always listens in form owed in *Bruselas.
To avert #one overloads of the Court of Justice, which is comprehensible, the Commission has foreseen to leave in hands of the national judges the decision on the granting of exemptions in the frame of section 3 of article 85.
do not want *detenerme in the juridical subjects that already have been perfectly tackled by Mr. *Lehne and Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi; *me interests more *detenerme in #some political subjects that still do not tackle of the all in the document, although no fits doubt that they will be object of debate in Parliament, since, thanks to #the same, grows the idea of *Europa.
As well, the *primer strategic goal of the document that have presented and that are here pretends precisely guarantee the balance among the inner market, by part, and defence of the interests of consumer and of the environment, by #another.
do not leave to escape this opportunity to reinforce the #european guidelines in matter of employment and to initiate to time a process directed to the creation of places of work of quality and to a fine social protection.
This measure also takes in consideration the fact that in the operation of an inner market follow existing problems social in the urban zones, #as well as in the rural zones of *Europa, and of course in my country, *Irlanda.
The local communities of the private sectors, public and of volunteering #would have to can *aunar talents collective in effort for creating employment in the sector of small and medium enterprises in his respective zones.
Consider positive, for example, the guidelines directed to the strengthening of the regional initiatives and venues of employment and the greater insistence in the *equiparación of women in employment politics and to this *respecto believe that here it follows being valid criticism of colleague, Mrs. *Theorin.
The correct reading, anyway, by part of States members will have to be that the main part of programs will not have to base in pertinent activities of the past, but in those #whose main goal was the acquisition of creative aptitudes.
services develop of two contrary moods: by part have the conversion in services of #all the productive sectors, included the agricultural -that is not mentioned-, it that conducts to the abolition of the limits among *ellos, and, by #another, industrialisation of the sector services.
In the field of employment politics and of standards of the social model European, among States members produces competition that no favours the achievement of the goals that declare that we want to pursue and in conditions that guarantee in theory.
Of the debate that here keeps from two hours ago believe that it derives an optimistic conclusion, since it results patent that the European Parliament no only follows the problem with attention and thinks to the *respecto, but that, especially, takes proposed in a subject so *excepcionalmente delicate as it is the #european strategy for employment.
Gentleman President, invoke our dignity of deputies because it is necessary to award to the signatures for politics and the political statements, dignity and space that reserves to the signatures for assistances and money.
Exist varied technologies to reduce simultaneously particle broadcasts and oxide broadcasts of nitrogen until level demanded by *nosotros in the first reading well by means of the addition of *amoniaco, well by means of an intermediate refrigerator combined with regeneration filter.
Have a possibility to conclude with a solution of first class the successful history of legislation relative to gas broadcasts for the improvement of the quality of the air.
The report of Mrs. *Avilés on the common position has been approved also after a hard fight around the change of juridical foundation of article 235 to article 152 on the procedure of *codecisión.
Equally, in other reports on the world-wide conferences of the UN in cooperation with third states , on #all with states *ACP, have conceded a political priority very high to the needs of boys
In the last debate that celebrate in this assembly on the case of the *Michelin, said that it is impossible to have restructurings of velvet, *velvet *changes, and #this is like this because we live a period in that restructurings are *grandísimas; have the entrance of technology, changes of the labour diet, there #be also a big enlargement of the phenomenon of the *mundialización.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, in occasion of the debate of 27 October happened on the subject *Michelin, remembered that Parliament had amended the directive on information and query to workers, and that expected that the Commission recovered amendments.
Conducts to transition terms interminable in the environmental field for states candidates, because of mood, and quote it of the official document: "#this #would carry to an increase of the financial effort".
Share sight point -#such as I already underlined in audition in front of Parliament in September- that reform of finance system has to have like goal a greater financial responsibility own of the Community.
To the finish, gentleman President, wanted to *puntualizar the fault of participation in the procedure of this report, because, except the Commission of Agriculture and #some of my colleagues that have helped in the amendments, #can not say that it have had a big participation.
It correct, instead, is to proceed to reexamine line guideline before the first enlargement on the base of the real needs not to block a series of orientative credits with total uncertainty on his *adecuación *respecto so much to the total as to the calendar.
In the report asks to the Commission that boost the optimum methods, the exchange of opinions and experiences, to increase awareness of the population without thus leave to respect subsidiariness principle.
The imperative more decisive of the energetic and environmental politics, to the *acercarnos to #millenium change, is the to fulfil commitments of *Kyoto and to #that *respecto, tax on CO2, #would exert, of course, an important paper.
By reason, believe that the Report *Smet means an important step for the improvement of the situation of *cientos of thousands of workers and to avert that the length of the labour day convert in a half illicit to increase competitiveness.
To5-0060\/1999 of Mr. *Lechner, in name of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, on directive proposal of the relative Council to notification or transfer in States members of judicial documents and *extrajudiciales in civil or mercantile matter [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^99<num>$^)<rpar>$ ^219<num>$  ^*C$­^0044<num>$/^1999<num>$  ^1999<num>$/^0102<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\>;
By means of the new proposal of the Council for a regulation on competition, recognition and execution of resolutions in familiar subjects and in the relative procedure to the parental responsibility, guarantees now to citizens and citizens of *Europa a unitary civil state.
In this sense only #can express my joy in front of the fact that every time there #be more countries -also countries members of the EU- that recognise marriage among two persons of sex and that comprise that couples #can wish have children and that #this is a wish that have right to see fulfilled.
#One of conditions imposed to *Bulgaria for the opening of adhesion negotiations is specifically fixation of a reasonable calendar for the closure of unit 1-4 of the nuclear head office of *Kozloduy that it has to elaborate before it finalise the year 1999.
Second, in how felt exactly poses problems *Francia? And #can Commissioner confirm that to consequence of the problems posed by *Francia only will have explanation to the French and do not change #any in export plan #british according to a calendar established?
*Me fear that the request to exclude to the #european companies of the application of this criminal law, by very useful that was this exception for the #european companies, in essence, do not solves the problem.
And have to say that I did not have doubt that #that was intention, because this Assembly knows the *curriculum of Commissioner, in particular step by *Hong *Kong, that *nos reveals an unambiguous commitment with defence of the human rights and of a democratic system no limited so only to *Europa.
Afterwards see dimensions of program in #Asia, that rises to some 350 millions of euros to the year, and *me *rasco head thinking in how go to be able to loan the level of necessary assistance to the that it #can be #one of the greater and more important democracies of the world.
Subject: Protection of the interests of the community companies in *Kosovo Telecommunication Organism of #Grecia (*OTE) and the #italian company *STET *International, owners of the 49% of the *Srbija *Telekom, confront in *Kosovo threats and pressures of the *ELK and "#others", with the goal of *expulsarlas of the region, in violation of the international agreements of the two companies, only legal owners of rights of network in *Kosovo.
*Cuando the Council examine, at the end of this year, the results of the Common Action of 1997 in the fight against violence that suffer women, #would be occasion to take the balance of the situation that His *Señoría finishes to describe.
The granting of distinct helps of the authorised that it has produced along these years has allocated, especially, to fund the social field of restructuring plan, specifically complementary compensations to employees sacked.
Gentleman High Representative, have to mention that, personally, have struggled against the Council that *usted chairs more of two years, no with military means, but in the courts, to access to document related with fulfillment, by part of States members, of the criteria that regulate the export of arms.
The European Union, with a common coin, a common market and a common legislation has a common interest in that #everything *ello translate also in security politics and common defence #worthy of credit.
Before being able to express my satisfaction by this proposal, wish that delete ambiguity arisen as a result of observations made by Defence minister #british, #Geoffrey *Hoon, to know, treats of an army *francobritánico or of an army of the EU?
Although, in the Low Countries, #some want to exert paper #british regarding the forced maintenance of the #atlantic relations, and *me refer to the previous #british paper, is not, without embargo, comparable with the questions concerning the *IESD that pose in States members of the neutral EU and without commitment.
And *permítame say to Mr. *Patten that receive with satisfaction it that has said on armaments, but proposes the Commission take follow-up of his previous communications acting with determination in this field and agrees *conmigo in that project meteoric Missile is of crucial importance for the future of defence industry #european?
*Nos add to demands of the #african countries of the south that ask not negotiating the fact that vegetables and animals or the human cells #can be patented subtracting wealth to the less favoured and taking greater multinationals.

Part of motivation that hides behind Diary 2000 is the to fulfil, of credible way, with the regulation of the world-wide trade and of step, of course, convert to *Europa in a key speaker in the world-wide trade; *algo that will not want the Americans.
members of the *OMC have to keep the possibility to concede priority in politics to the public health, to the welfare of animals, to the environmental protection and to solidarity with the countries in development.
Wanted to urge also to the Commission and to States members to that they look for commitment *vinculante of the *OMC that allow to #all the pertinent exports of the less developed countries the free access of tariffs to the #european markets before the year 2003.
Also defend a #red protectionism, in the that it aspire to guarantee the rights of workers and to prevent the use of unfair methods of work, as, for example, hand utilisation of drama childish.
To time, #can not be that the world enrich thanks to a new agreement of the *OMC, but that, simultaneously, impoverish in the field of culture and of the environment, or in the field of agriculture and horticulture, and that lose in terrains that have an essential value for *Europa.
Only #can, then, take emphasis in that the negotiators of the European Union print seal to conversations, so that, to time, consolidate the current basic right of the International Organisation of Trade of face to the future.
The best guarantee for security of foods is transparency of chains alimentary and the existence of a clear assignment of control functions and of the *incumbencia of responsibilities.
#This, without embargo, do not supposes that we created that #many of the inherent problems to the fundamental rights in Chinese are resolved or in roads of solution, neither that *callemos that, in the past, States Joined adopted two weights and measures to hour to demand fulfillment of the social clause.
defence of traditions and specific shots of the own regions by means of restrictions to trade politics looms with undermining the bases of exchange, of development and of knowledge divulging, culture and welfare.
The Council of Ministers has to tackle simultaneously to the Conference *Intergubernamental an internal reform, #such as it requested in the document *Trumpf-*Pires, and the core of #the same has to be the adoption of the vote by majority like norm and the *codecisión of this House, associated to #the same, in #all the legislative acts.
Without embargo, enlargement of the number of actors in the #european stage will pose institutional problems and will generate appreciable operative weaknesses #if they do not adopt opportunely the suitable measures and reforms deeply the current system before enlargement.
The #german diary "*Die *Welt" described yesterday like this the proposal: the classical defence of *Europa will follow being exclusive task of NATO and intervention body of the EU will not compete with this last, but that it will be #one *baza more to disposal.
Like this, consider that the adoption of new federal powers in level of the Union do not takes thing that stress disequilibrium and the moves away of villages that the compose, as it is *sucediendo a bit in each #one of reforms, as they show it the high taxes of abstention, in #all *Europa, in the #european elections.
The Governmental Conference will have to fulfil a very difficult calendar, since it is precise that complete his committed in the planned term for no *ocasionar delay in enlargement and, to time, his committed is to prepare to the European Union for said enlargement, is to say, that is subject to some adjusted *márgenes temporary and confronts with a big challenge.

As in the continuation of the question has mentioned the *travesía rail of the *Pirineos among *Francia and *España, want to signal that, in fact, this rail link is not included, by moment, in communication network to #european level, #such as #this understood when being approved in 1996 by the Council and by Parliament.
In consequence, to sight of the concrete failure, checked of said political, the question is: will Follow funding this type of projects that in reality reinforce some totalitarian diets, diets in fact criminal and *opresores of the human rights?
*Me ask #if in the assessments that, as *nos has said, is the Council, has included also an assessment costs\/benefits of it that cost to the #european taxpayers #all fight actions against drug and how benefits are in practice.
Gentleman President, wanted to consider positive the fact that they have taken management in front of *Turquía, but want to signal to time my disappointment *cuando restrictions imposed by *Turquía to freedom of commercial navigation of #everyone, included the fleets *mercantes of the European Union are described simply of performances.
In effect, the purpose of the agreement consisted equally in finding a solution to the problem of the called *whistle *blower, #as well as to the following question: how takes civil servant *cuando has knowledge of the existence of fraud or of indications of corruption, but by reasons that was do not wants to take it know to his upper?
And #if, besides, think that of compliance with this text members of Parliament are forced to collaborate with activities of the *OLAF and are forced to *delatar to colleagues, get to the conclusion that rule attentive against the essence of the free mandate.
To reach politics of nature require measures and efforts to reach unanimity among States members with regard to the need to have a politics of asylum human and generous.

On the other hand, is precise to punish to managers of slaughterings and of attempts against humanity no only so that it take justice in *Timor, but also so that, in fact, #that was an example that present in parts of the world, #where, by misfortune, still exist and persist attacked against the dignity and, especially, against life that, to our understand, is an inalienable right.
Gentleman President, although the situation in *Timor Oriental has taken look thanks to the change of power in Indonesian and thanks to the arrival of peace strength, conditions in the that find citizens of on foot in *Timor Oriental and refugees in *Timor Western continue being very worrisome.
#All have seen the poignant images of the last *reo executed by the Court of *Florida and therefore no *les *extrañará to #any of the colleagues that the first person that appears in the text of the common resolution was citizen #spanish -and therefore of the European Union- #Joaquín #José *Martínez, #whose conviction ask that it review and #whose pity of death ask that it suspend.
Finally, is necessary, as they have defended colleagues, that the European Union and the Council impose the abolition of death pity by means of a special clause in the political and economic agreements with third countries.
The European Union, gentleman *Lamy, #would be had to represent paper in this sense, to avert in the future excess type, that are disastrous for the populations that wish the truth and justice?
In breast of family is #where boys learn values of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity" (Preamble), #as well as the necessary aptitudes to carry to practice values in society during #all life.
*Me satisfies of joy can support the resolution proposal that have today in front of *nosotros, that tends to achieve that these rights recognise: the rights of progenitors to raise children, and the rights of children to this protection and to support.
Of work expect a lot regarding a greater knowledge of the phenomenon, of data existence and comparable informations and especially of surveillance, identification and prohibition proposal of dangerous substances planted in the market.
The own Commission of Juridical Subjects, that has occupied of this subject, has adopted unanimously, repeat, unanimously, this position with the vote of #all the groups and after examination detailed. As I already have said, #would want that this measure cost for #all offences.
Believe that we have advanced of form very substantial in measure in that the European Bank of Investments has accepted that the *OLAF have #all information and have of #everything it necessary to analyse loans *bonificados with bottoms community, it that beyond all doubt has to be the fundamental object of worry.
Gentleman President, after the approval of the amendment presented by Mr. *Lisi, member of the Group of the Popular Party European, elect in Strength lists #Italia, express with greater satisfaction the explanation of my favourable vote to this measure.
Mr. Newton *Dunn chose the *primer *pilar, *nosotros were of the opinion that we #would have to leave the procedure in the *tercer *pilar, because in #this criminal group that make fakes of passports is greater that in the first, #where Mr. Newton *Dunn has included it, and #where concentrates persecution of document fake exclusively on the illegal immigrants.
With *ello adhesion Record treated to keep in measure of it possible the special statute that Canarian had had inside the #spanish State from incorporation to Crown of *Castilla in the century *XV.
As it will know Mr. Commissioner, the week that comes celebrates in *Bruselas a meeting of *partenariado in the that the Commission will argue with the Governments of *España, *Francia and *Portugal and with the Governments of the autonomous regions and the #european members of parliament of these regions the proposals to the *respecto.
Gentleman Commissioner *Liikanen, from takes varied years come treating, first in the frame of the Commission of Economic Subjects and now in the of Industry Commission, the reports and the relative questions to industry and to the naval construction.
Is *algo of it that has to talk *cuando treat the question to have in *Europa field of equal game for the sector; in fact, it that need is field of equal game for workers to scale international.
This sector, that #can seem, from a point of global sight, enough *marginal, exerts without embargo an essential paper in the balance of the economic and social tissue of our maritime coastal zones.
Without embargo, two years ago the European Commission froze the community help, and the of States members, to the construction of new ships while they had not reached the clear-cut goals in orientation plans *plurianuales of scrapping of fuselages.
Want to remember especially to gentleman Commissioner that, in relation with negotiations for adhesion, the Union promised to loan attention to the far situation and to the climatic conditions of *Finlandia when taking decisions on the goals of politics of continental navigation.
Like this have affirmed it civil servants of the General Direction *VII of the Commission, according to letter of #the same dated the 4.8.1999 when calling attention on the fact that help do not saves relation with dockyards of the EU.
Believe that it is fundamental that the European Union exert a strong pressure to get to an agreement of *autolimitación of production by part of *Corea, in addition to #everything it that already has said concerning norms allocated to avert distortion of competition.
But to judge by the current panorama, only #can *decirles that the majority of the Governments are against of the incorporation of article relative to sport in the Treaty. #There is #some Governments that wish to advance in this direction.
As sporty, like #european citizen and like member of Parliament wanted to, on the one hand, manifest very vigorously my disagreement with this proposal of the Council and, on the other hand, *preguntarle how measured thinks to take the Commission so that sport have presupposed in the European Union and so that like this we #can work from here by the #european sport.
Obviously, adhesion negotiations will not be able to begin until *Turquía do not fulfil the political criteria of *Copenhague that put on purpose the accent in the human rights, respect of minorities and the religious freedom without limitations.
From sight point more general, wish to remember that security politics and defence requires the creation of a military industry to scale #european, able to compete with efficiency in the technological and financial plane.
These particular subjects form part of the important group of the agenda of the European Council of *Helsinki, and, as it already has indicated here, this group conforms a dynamic #such, that, to succeed, the summit of *Helsinki will happen to history.
Expect that Speaker in exercise of the Council regret, as I take *yo, the *intromisión of the General Secretary of NATO in politics of the party, #whose logical repercussion is attack to defence politics of *Finlandia and of States members.
Without embargo, in a historical moment like #this, in the *cual or has value to give a big step advance or #if it do not runs the risk to be condemned to a long impotence, consider that audacity and value explain more that realism.
*Me #would enjoy to underline that the editorial of the Letter of Fundamental Rights is a subject of the maximum importance. And will have to watch by that it do not remain in a simple statement and convert by the contrary in character text *vinculante.
Go to answer in an a bit distinct order to the of interventions, but as I see that Mr. *Harbour is still present, also *le will say that the Commission will present to the European Council of *Helsinki a wide initiative on society of information.
Finally, want *comunicarles that the colleague #Chris *Patten, that regrets a lot not being able to be present today here because of a political commitment outside, has to present, jointly with *Poul *Nielson and *conmigo same, a communication on the requirement of respect of the human rights and of democratisation in our external relations.
How is possible to keep death pity and ask *ingresar in the European Union is *algo that do not leaves of *asombrarme; without embargo, it that *me surprises even more is that it talk to concede candidate statute to the one who still has not abolished death pity.
Gentleman President, back the reports of Mr. *Morillon relative to actions directed to reach the economic and social development of *Turquía, #as well as to deepen the union *aduanera among the EU and this country; especially now, after the two earthquakes that has suffered *Turquía this year.
In a report of this year, the WHO get, besides, to the conclusion that pollution of the air caused by vehicle traffic causes even more died that circulation accidents. The costs *macroeconómicos are also high.
Suggest a light modification of the text so that it adjust to a standard terminology; is to say: "Considering that the *benceno is agent *cancerígeno *genotóxico for humans and that no exists an identifiable threshold underneath of the *cual no comport risk for the human health"
After having listened interventions made in the course of the debate, the Commission thinks that States members #would have to can request terms longer to fulfil value limit of *benceno in those cases in that term of 2010 #can involve serious socioeconomic problems.
look already is contemplated among the requirements of general notification of the Directive 96\/62 and the corresponding Decision of the Council 97\/101 on the reciprocal exchange of information on the quality of the air.
Coincide with *él in that the planned term for the entrance in vigour of the directive #can not be on 1 January of the year 2000, but that it has to have enlargement of at least three years to give time to States members to adjust to the directive.
Goes in , for example, the sector of tourism in the concept of trade, in the *front-*loading, in the *predistribución , #if we think that precisely in Christmas period and New Year citizens of States members find in tourist zones, in zones of practice of sport of ski?
This false opinion, that still finds spread, due to the fact that parity among the euro, the dollar and the yen, has followed, lamentably, a *derrotero different to the that seemed to show still day 4 January, do not has to conduct to that impose mistaken ideas on value of the euro.
conditions agreed in the international program of protection of dolphins for the use of networks of siege of *jareta, that will apply provisionally in group in the Community, determine that it incorporate in this regulation a review of the size of tights for two species of *pintarroja.
On the other hand, the fact that *yo was the representative of the greatest island of the Mediterranean -*Sicilia- and president of the province of *Catania, in the *cual is very elevated the number of persons that devote to fishing, *me #would allow to contribute examples of daily experiences.
Report (To5-0065\/1999) of Mrs. *Breyer, in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer on directive proposal of the European Parliament and the Council on the limits of *benceno and monoxide of carbon in the air acclimatise (*COM(1998)591 - *C4-0135\/1999 - 1998\/0333(*COD))
The fact to favour "the #european implantation of *Turquía", as it expressed it #Jacques *Chirac in *Estambul, on 18 November, recognising candidate statute to *Turquía, will be perceived by the #turkish authorities like stimulus to continue with politics.
Have the *sensatez of not changing this situation, gentleman President, and entrust in the means of modern payment, like the banking cards or the electronic wallet, to facilitate life of travellers and of those who live in border zones.
#If we examine by moment bottom reason, believe that we have to recognise that the *OMC do not has to be already the one who supervise liberalisation negotiation among countries industrialised and that this situation has been modified of two forms: in the first place, no longer #can *limitarnos to reduce obstacles *arancelarios and no *arancelarios to exchanges.
In truth, #if it do not appears reference expresses, means that agriculture will be treated like a normal economic activity, with it that they will be every time greater pressures of competitors to finish with #all support types achieved. Underline it of "#all the types".
The *segunda thing that have seen -and believe that here neither #would owe *hacernos illusions-: the interest of the civil society, #such as it has manifested in *Seattle, has not been merely an interest by the world-wide round, but also demonstration against #everything it that do not likes to persons.
In the Country of *Gales, of #where come from, receive important sums with charge to the structural Bottoms, but line that separates the creation of work place and the *salvaguarda of work place is badly clear-cut and, therefore, *nos results difficult to evaluate it effective that have been said structural Bottoms.
In the next years will have to exert a fundamental paper regarding the examination of the financial frame and of the frame with seen to enlargement, because it will be then *cuando see until where gives of himself\/hisself *SOCRATES *II and capacity to attend to the new European Union expanded.
Definitely, person badly formed is not able to insert in society, in spite of #all his unseen or visible aptitudes, and think that it is loss no only for the market of employment but also for society in general.
The proposal has two fundamental goals: on the one hand, the creation of control system and obligation of parts *contratantes and on the other hand, the set up of program allocated to boost fulfillment of norms of the *CPANE by fuselages of third parts.
Gentleman President, this directive represents the *primer case in that the European Commission answers with a proposal to appeal presented by the European Parliament in virtue of the power of indirect legislative initiative that *le awards the Treaty of *Maastricht.
Is an important and notable fact of face to the balance *interinstitucional because it shows that Parliament #can find to an attentive and available speaker *cuando, with arrangement to the planned procedures in the Treaty, asks to the Commission that give follow-up to an initiative founded.
Gentleman President, two years after the negative result of the referendum in Swiss on integration in the Economic Space European, the Council authorised to the Commission to negotiate bilateral agreements with country in the fields that went necessary.
Declare my full compliance with bottom subject, is to say, with calculation method that proposes to distribute the number of permissions among the different States members and that, in the circumstances mentioned, is the most objective, rigorous and *equitativo of the possible.
Gentleman President, the proposal of the Commission has by object deliver the 90% of permissions to States members that have the greater part of circulation with Swiss and guarantee to time a basic contingent for #all States members of 1500 permissions to the year.
Sometimes has the impression of that, according to a determined way to understand the protection of the environment, the affirmation of principle, by not saying the concept, at the end is more important that the concrete result.
The Commission #can not accept the amendment 30, #whose goal is to expand the possibilities to concede exceptions in the case of substances that already have left of use .
The greater problems find in the unsatisfactory internal situation, in the anomalies in the operation of the democratic system and in rape of the human rights, included the rights of minorities.
Need to clear varied things, #such as paper of members of the EU that are not it of NATO in strength and member paper of NATO that are not it of the EU concerning strength, #if they wish to take part.
*Me #one to the wish of Prime minister, Mr. *Lipponen, that #if *Rusia exerted better in the future quality of member of the world-wide community, #would take possible to carry out cooperation *transfronteriza among the Union and *Rusia in border north, and *ello #would confer *substancialidad to the #nordic dimension.
Gentleman President, in the presentation of the conclusions of *Helsinki, President has formulated two propositions: a process of enlargement effective and #worthy of credit has to have continuity, and the countries candidates take part in equality of conditions in adhesion process.
The Commission has approved also a communication in the that formulate the goals and principles of politics audiovisual community to half term and formulates a strategy for call "was of the digital means".
The first proposal refers to the materialisation of training program for professionals of the #european industry of audiovisual programs, the called program "Half-Training", in the that appears a financial endowment of 50 millions of euros for the period 2001-2005.
Therefore, bottom is simultaneously bottom that has emergency component, but that, to time, has like goal the to guarantee the finance of measures of structural politics of support to the received, integration and the voluntary repatriation of refugees and *asilados.
Now well, believe that the greater consumption of audiovisual products Europeans requires rather pedagogy directed to the own Europeans, stimulus to taste and to assessment of the #european culture and rejection of *tantos products of bad quality that *nos get of parts of the world.
In this directive is foreseen that boys that *reagrupan with a familiar that was permanent legal immigrant in the countries of the Union will have right to the total education in conditions that children of citizens of States members.
#Can *garantizarle that so much the General Direction of Justice and Subjects of Interior like the General Direction of Employment and Social Subjects have very clear consciousness that it is of strategic importance guarantee access to education of boys of the legal immigrants in the countries of the Union.
Without embargo, in this context *yo *les #would pray that they take into account that perhaps it #would suit to procure establish links among the competent services in matter of transport and the competent services in the field of competition, so as to advance in the adoption of decisions of general character in matter of politics of transports in *Europa.
*Permítanme that *recapitule moment to remember that said granting goes to award, but still has not awarded, with condition and commitment that the pertinent income of motorway will invest in the tunnel of the base of the *Brénero, or was, in the railway.
In the work committee on indicators of the quality and in the ministerial level examine explanatory factors, like study plan, training of professors, resources, the evaluation and other.
To trial the agenda of the Council of Ministers of Education of the past 26 November had been able to receive the proposal of a permanent committee on the quality of education.
do not considers the Commission that all #this constitutes a clear discrimination inside a same Been member and, besides, forces to the inhabitants that #would want to play in the regions of the centre and of the south to resort to States members -exist *cientos of casinos in *Europa- before remaining to play in the north of #Italia?
Subject: Price of tourism cars In front of advertising of the subject, the Commission will have proof that car manufacturers of tourism are much more in Realm Joined that in countries of the EU by identical cars.
#If *yo organised a round table with industry -with the sellers and manufacturers-, #would be *usted had to assist and examine with *ellos how #can find form to finish with this problem, without thus leave to resort to the instruments in matter of competition, #if it do not remains more remedy?
Regarding category 1 *B, estimate very timely the decision of the Council to accept the amendment of Parliament to get to quality politics for the agricultural products Europeans.
My Group will support, besides, the rest of the amendments of category 1 *B. Now that take place negotiations of the *OMC, and *cuando #everyone talks that it carry out a fine rural politics, is important that the European Union exert an active politics in this field.
#If the problem has to to the *inadecuación of income system of the European Union, it will be necessary to recognise the need to modify finance system of the European Union to solve it.
Specifically, proposes the nomination for the first time of Mr. *Reynders of *Bélgica, Mrs. *Geoghegan-*Quinn of *Irlanda, Mr. *Caldeira of *Portugal and Mr. *Fabra *Vallés of *España, and the nomination for a new mandate of Gentlemen *Mohr of *Dinamarca, *Salmi of *Finlandia, #Clemente of #Italia and *Karlsson of *Suecia, quoted following the alphabetic order of the countries that the have designated.
*Eso wants to say that it competes also to the Court of Accounts watch by that the protection of the financial interests of the Community take from a *corpus *juris only and leave to take , as up to now, from legislation disperses, unconnected and contradictory, that treats the diverse attempts against the financial interests of the Community in accordance with politics to the that refer and no in accordance with principles *equitativos.
The possibility to suspend action in the *nefasta hypothesis of explosion of a crisis is, definitely, a strong *disuasivo that will force to the New Independent States and *Mongolia to find a solution negotiated to clashes and to *reducirlos to a dialectic normal politics.
The purpose to reach an agreement on some common norms is hit in the context of an economy *globalizada, but also from sight point of the global requirements in matter of protection of the environment.
In the debate on adhesion to the Agreement of 1958, in the frame of the Report *Kittelmann elaborated in moment, already kept a vehement discussion on until how point *ello put in *entredicho the political participation of Parliament, specifically right of *codecisión.
And no treats only of questions so popular like the rise of level of the sea and the disappearance of the small States *isleños or flood of the lowest zones of *Bangladesh or of the Low Countries.
Is urgent, as, that now adopt important measures to associate to citizens to the takings of decision in the matter, to end of *responsabilizarlos in front of the phenomenon of the climatic change, by means of, for example, instauration of wide advertising campaigns, that act on the behaviours of each #one.
Of here that *me *extrañe that nobody from then have taken quotation to this fact in the concrete proposals with sight put in fulfillment of commitments of *Kioto and *me #would enjoy to ask to the Commission #if #this specifically forms part of reflections of the Commission.
The *segunda: that, at last, in the field of car, further of norms that have approved, have of renewal strategy of the ancient park, park that contaminates considerably more, in comparison with the park of recent vehicles.
The argument, according to the *cual the nuclear energy is not a sustainable method of production of energy owing to waste and, therefore, #can not be included in the field of development mechanisms no *contaminante, is not argument *defendible in no way.
Have to allocate more bottoms to sources of alternative energy and announces likewise that the utilisation of solid fuels and oil will give step to a greater utilisation of natural gas and renewable energies and to electricity generation in the future.
The European Union underlines this special identity of *Macao and considers important that conserve the rights and freedoms of citizens in compliance with the conjoint Statement of Chinese and *Portugal, issued in 1987, and with the Constitution of the special autonomous region.
In our opinion are created conditions so that they develop the economic and cultural relations with cooperation base and mutual benefit among the Popular Republic of Chinese, in particular by means of *Macao, the European Union and States members.
Report (To5-0084\/1999) of Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market, relative to the decision on verification of the *credenciales after the *quinta direct election to the European Parliament, of the 10 to 13 June 1999
. (IN) The Commission considers that the common position is a pragmatic and efficient solution that solves satisfactorily the problems of the majority of accidents in the that the two parts involved are #european, is to say, the that occur in the interior of the European Union.
Gentleman President, wanted to call attention in the amendment 13 on an important difference among the #german text -that of course is the original text of Mr. *Rothley- and the #english versions and believe that also the French.
The true solution resides no in tolerance of information fault of consumers, but in the greater efforts that make to separate products modified genetically of the conventional products, in #all production process.
A #european conference #can celebrate simultaneously to a meeting of the UN, only #if, by part, endows of a political #european intern and #if, on the other hand, shows a common determination in the frame of the dynamics of the UN.
The Commission of the Rights of Woman and Equality of Opportunities of Parliament has explicitly included in goals follow-up and the realisation of the international agreements, #such as Action Platform of *Beijing.
The unanimous opinion of the Managerial Committee Scientific that there #be not need to review the decision to raise the embargo on meat of *vacuno #british was enormously *tranquilizadora in this sense.
Support the call of Mr. *von *Wogau, but also wanted to *referirme to appeal of Mr. *Goepel, because it has taken a constitutional suggestion very interesting, to know, that the representative of the Council take part in connection with the Report *Papayannakis.
*Cuando the French Agency of Health and Security in Foods challenged this decision, *algo that was in right to take, *me imagine that in terms of his own competition, the case was put in hands of the Scientific Committee, that backed by unanimity security of meat of *vacuno #british.
Regarding the referendum, the Council, instead, has taken note of the report of the General Secretary of Nations Joined that it remits to the need of *reflexionar thoroughly on the possible consequences that #can have this subject, also the related with the date of the referendum.
Gentleman President, the European Union has not taken part on purpose in treatment of this subject, but, without embargo, studies means to contribute of constructive form to advance of the peace process in the region of the *Sáhara Western.
In this context, the Presidency #finnish confirmed that the European Union considers important fulfillment of the four Agreements of Gin and of the two complementary Protocols, that constitute the fundamental treaties of the international humanitarian Right.
By a *desencuentro among the Groups of this Assembly -believe that more of formality that by disagreement on bottom of the proposal-, did not include #this for the debate, but will insist in next Plenaries in attention to the importance of the subject, very highlighted by the answer of the representative of the Council.
Has foreseen to influence the Council so that, when reforming the procedures of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the own Court adopt the principle of advertising and give greater transparency to the process of taking of decisions?
Although -for example, in Realm Joined- exists the legal right to impose interests to payments delayed, there #be not practically forms to achieve materialisation and the judicial actions are not practical to recover small debts.
Propose a maximum term of eight months. And with amendments, of course, approved by the Environment Commission, gentleman President, substantially coincide also *nosotros with the proposals to leave to side the *codecisión, so that we do not lose time and forcing was a reality it before possible.
Without pretending minimise the gravity of the situation, the repercussions in confidence of consumers have been a lot greater, in my opinion, that the real threat to the public health.
It that do not has explanation is that #all States members of the European Union matter dairy products with *BST -the pertinent majority of the *EEUU, the Czech Republic, *Eslovaquia or *Bulgaria- that get to the table of consumers from takes long, for example cheeses elaborated with milk obtained by means of technician.
compatriots, the international opinion, know that conviction was solid, when declaring to exit of prison: "Like free man, *me engage to take all it that was in power to bring peace to *Timor Oriental and to my village".

book is a very cultural, writing is the first form of fixation of language, of identification of language. And create, even being important fulfillment of norms of competition, that the cultural look of the subject has to consider of equal importance and rank.
Why the Commission #would not collect our proposal to extend the possibility to apply the system of the only price of book to the group of States members?
Want likewise ensure to #all participants in the debate that, to the equal that *ustedes, the Commission and *yo attribute importance to culture, to book, recognise the cultural importance of book and are had to take into account these specificities.
By reason, the EU #would have to *prorrogar sale embargo of arms to Indonesian, that already hard four years, as #if we had to raise said embargo of armament, the message that #would send to soldiers #would be, undoubtedly, that accepts performance and the recognise, whereas, as I finish to signal, *eso is far to be the case.
Have to command a clear message to the #indonesian authorities in the sense that we do not go to accept by more time contempt by respect wishes of the human rights and of peace of the international community.
Gentleman President, sure enough, once again the European Parliament has to pronounce against of death pity, against of the greater rape of the human rights that follows committing in the world, many times and for our collective shame, to the protect of laws that have elaborated men that represent the popular sovereignty.
Therefore I want to call attention on point 5 of our Resolution, that says that we reiterate appeal to the Council that it incorporate in negotiations with third countries -with #all- "the abolition of death pity like clause of respect of the human rights" .
Gentleman President, for Christian moratorium request to death pity and abolition is not only a duty or an obligation, but an ethical election of respect to person that has mistaken and that it #can and has to redeem .
The public execution of *Zaarmeena, the obligation to carry the *burka, the negation of the right to health and to education of women are only #some examples of the flagrant rapes that against the human rights commit in said country.
Gentleman President, am outraged by arrest conditions of the political prisoners in *Djibouti, but am equally outraged by hypocrisy of the leaders of the #french State, those who #can, #if they wanted to it, put end immediately to authoritarianism and to the bad deals that it is responsible diet of *Djibouti.
This circumstance do not prevents that #such electoral process contradict the agreements of Nations Joined for the elimination of form of discrimination, and that likewise contradict the international pacts on civil rights and politicians.
The European Union fixed his opinion on *Afganistán in a Common Position adopted on 25 January 1999, in the that affirmed clear and unambiguously that will demand respect of the human rights in *Afganistán and, in particular, will defend the rights of women #afghan.
Have to hear the calls of the International Federation of Cross #Red and loan attention to the grave situation in that it finds persons, that in the past remained decimated by things #such as the orange agent, employed by the #EE.UU. Now, the natural catastrophes *les cause problems still greater.
To title of example, and among *tantos #others, the General Council of *Pirineos Oriental has approved help of 42 millions of frank, the region *Languedoc-*Rosellón, help of 50 millions, the Senate, help of 400.000 frank and, finally, the #french Government announced help of 1,2 *millardo.
Gentleman President, only want to say that the liberal do not want to take part in these votes on the natural catastrophes because we think that this subject no competes to the European Parliament and believed to have understood that we no longer #would have to treat this type of decisions.
*Eso *me allows *decirles that Speaker had wanted to be with *ustedes in these moments, but, lamentably, as *ustedes know, is delicate of health days and, therefore, in name, in the of the Table and in the #mine own, *les wanted to express to #all *ustedes his best wishes for Christmases, for this next year and went to say the next #millenium.
And without embargo, of product live *bastantes families of agriculturalists in the producing countries, and especially, in *Baviera, that do not have to be abandoned to luck in a period in that prices drop constantly, #as well as they neither have to remain empty determined agricultural zones by temporary difficulties caused by irregularities in the operation of the market.
change carries to cancel determined articles of the ancient regulation and #this is it that takes the new regulation, and takes well; *nosotros vote in favour of the new regulation together with the amendments of Mr. *Mayer, signalling that regulation proposal do not has sequela on the budget.
The Commission backs #many of the amendments that have proposed, especially #that that mention a budgetary control more severe, by #if it produced a political evolution refusal in the country, and also the proposal so that it deliver a final report the year 2004.
In the Council no is consensus on this question, by it that regret *muchísimo *tenerle that say that I do not see the most minimum possibility that during the Presidency #german #can conclude this subject, in any case no of a positive mood.
Insisting in the question, do not believes *usted that it #would be better that the European Union took in hands -no only supported- his charitable influence on *Marruecos to demand that in these six months, that are very sensitive, achieved referendum just that so much expect the *saharauis?
Subject: Measures of support to the insular regions of the *UniónSegún article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #one of the obligations of the Union is the adoption of measures to reduce delay of the regions or islands less favoured.
Know that in the next days will begin in *Nairobi peace negotiations on the internal situation in *Sudán and, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, *me ask #if it #can not pose this same question in said negotiations, so as to that the Government of *Sudán perceive the strong pressure of the international community.
#Which are participation modalities that the Presidency in exercise of the Council has foreseen for the European Parliament in the next Summit of Bosses of State and of Government of the European Union and of the countries of *América Latin and of the *Caribe, that will take place in River of *Janeiro the next month of June?
A possible participation of deputies of the European Parliament in the Conference of State Bosses and of Government of the European Union, *Latinoamérica and the *Caribe that will celebrate to finals of June of 1999 in River of *Janeiro, regulates according to the procedure that the Council agreed on 30 October 1998.
By it that refers to the Commission, this institution has been already object of a particular report of Mr. *Bourlanges, that this Assembly approved do not takes a lot and that comports a series of proposals directed to improve operation.
#If also in the future Parliament will follow showing prudence to hour to entrust increasingly tasks to the Commission, will mean that it will have known *perseverar in the spirit of the resolution of the colleague *Herman, to the one who with taste go back to *rendir homage.
Finally and especially, transparency, democracy and rigour for the Council, #if it wants to be day a true government, but with #this go out surely of the field of the Report *Herman and even of the Report *Bourlanges to go in in the of the future conference *intergubernamental that this morning announced -*me has seemed to hear- President in exercise, thing of the that *me congratulate #if *nos confirms.
Certainly, treats of a subject that will have to be resolved of a global way and, for *ello, is indispensable, before that at all, a new cultural approximation of the group of the #czech society but corresponds to the Government of *Praga activate #all the legislative measures that favour integration.
In this sense, create absolutely pertinent the initiative of the Presidency #german to extend program *PHARE also to support of the social dimension of the economy of the countries candidates.
Like this as, from sight point of diversity of nature, the situation of these countries #can consider even very fine or, at least, considerably better that in the greater part of States current members.
As I already have had opportunity to say many times in these debates, in my opinion the greater deficiency of countries is the administration and the judicial system, #as well as modernisation fault and of investments.
*Eslovenia, the penultimate in row of the countries with the that are: especially in the report on November progresses remained clear that regarding harmonisation in general *Eslovenia had not taken the sufficient progresses.
By error -*me has signalled it Mr. *Speciale, the one who was speaker for *Eslovenia-have signalled a series of delays suffered by *Eslovenia in the *preparativos for adhesion, without that it have pronounced the following positive sentences that *me #would enjoy still went included in record on the subject, #if it #can be.
#would Have to find a balance among the situation that gave in the past *cuando had to pray that *nos came to visit and the present situation in that visitors are so numerous because the European Parliament, graces also to work, has converted in more important.
civil servants of the Commission cooperate a lot in our work and *les remain appreciated thus, but, for request minority that the Commission has not been able to resolve, is evident that is not a fine practice the entrust so much in personnel of the Commission.
Believe that Defender of Village has defended of sufficient form transparency and information, and finish, gentleman President, with a *alegato in favour of style change, so that *Europa do not represent the *hermetismo and bureaucracy, but democracy and transparency.
Keep disposals by the that the community institutions #can deny to facilitate to Defender of the Populate documents receiving of form properly reasoned to secret professional or because civil servants and the rest of employees pronounce in name and following instructions of administrations, no only is not necessary, but especially improper.
In September of 1997, the Commission wanted to concede 35 millions more to program. The European Parliament called to order to the Commission because in the case of a simple budgetary increase is not necessary the procedure of *codecisión.
amendments procure to improve the fight against fraud and Mrs. *Peijs has *percatado of the most important of #all, that treats of form to relate collection costs with execution criteria.
To time *emplazo to the Commission to that take very seriously the application of the White Book so that the concept that my Group and *yo back #can take reality. Am convinced that this White Book opens the path to a sustainable mobility on a long-term basis in *Europa.
Like Group of the Popular Party European *nos see forced to refuse the proposal of the Commission to introduce a uniform system of *tarificación for #all transport moods on the base of the called social costs *marginales.
And to me *me seems that it #would be important that Parliament showed the priority that attributes to relations with the regional and local authorities, that represent the intermediate levels of #all can, of #all institutional political structure; in definite, with *ellos share our elective character.
The Greens have voted against of agreement proposal of fishing with the *Seychelles as we also have voted against of fishing agreements, no because *nos *opongamos to fishing agreements in principle, but because we estimate that it is precise to modify the approach that follows the EU.
On the other hand, am fully in accordance with the unconditional backrest to the military intervention of NATO, for treating of a necessary operation, correct and positive, and help to the neighbouring States. Without embargo, there #be point that throw in fault.
Therefore, in this case, regarding Serbian and *Kosovo, after ten years of intermittent negotiations, of transgressions of the human rights, of rapes, of slaughterings, of destructions and of deportations, in the origin of the *cuales *nos find always with *Milosevic, no existed, alas, another solution, as it did not go utilisation of strength to detain crimes!
Like this as, only have offered to the SIN wait hall, admission terms permanently differed, as #if it treated of a mirage, it that generates exclusion, discrimination, frustrations and humiliations.
In effect, #all States confront to destruction problems of the environment, of pollution or even of congestion of the urban centres. In this sense, the goal of *internalizar the external costs generated by the different moods of transport is perfectly justified.
By reason the package of relative measures to the railways foresees explicitly the granting of subsidies to lines *férreas *cuando have external costs *impagados in moods of competitive transport, as for example road.
And finish, gentleman President, going back to appreciate sincerely the amply favourable report presented and the opportunity that *me has offered to explain the position of the Commission regarding the amendments that consider inadmissible and that expect that they #can reexamine to sight of it that have said.
In the first place and before that at all, wanted to appreciate to the acting speaker, Mrs. #Colombo *Svevo, the hard work made and disposal that has shown to collect the amendments and suggestions of the Commission of Public Freedoms and Inner Subjects.
Constitutes security a priority for the Commission, *cuando #this *presiona to countries like Swiss so that it dismantle restrictions of transport by road or *cuando imposes competition and liberalisation in this sector, in detriment of the rail transport, although this last was safer and ecological?
Gentleman President, will have been necessary death of forty persons in the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc, in terrible circumstances, so that the #european authorities take consciousness of the consequences of the uncontrolled development of transport by road in mountain zones.
Is evident that the results of investigations *esclarecerán the circumstances of drama, and in this sense, have to congratulate to the #french Government for having acted with rapidity and for having public fact the first resulted of investigations.
Gentleman President, in the past weeks, diet #burmese has gone back to drop in infamy: Mrs. Saint *Suu *Kyi, Prize *Sájarov, that did not enjoys of freedom of movement, #can not at least go back to see to husband before it died.
On the other hand, until they do not guarantee the human rights and do not restart this democratic process wished by the immense majority of village #burmese, will be impossible to establish normal relations and, add, board any type of relation with country.
Is very #sad ascertain that, only century chamber later, begins to have a small possibility that it treat with justice to the victims. But even this small possibility looms with disappear #if it hides the implication in genocide of the current political leaders.
The solution, therefore, is only #one: an International Penal Court, a natural judge attendant to judge #all crimes against humanity, committed by person, in place and in time.
To mood to see, the modifications proposed prejudice seriously to the small employers and to the economic sector that it treats, since to date #this have been supply relations usual and efficiency has remained shown.
Are convinced that #all citizens *estonios have to have freely of plural information so much on the advantages as on problems of adhesion to the equal that expect the celebration of a referendum to decide belonging of the country to the EU.
The congratulate thus, and also the congratulate for having left proof that measures proposed by the Commission #would not have to aggravate the cost of transport, but allow utilisation of the most efficient infrastructures and more respectful of the environment.
transport companies #european, treat of the railway, of transport by road, of the aerial traffic or of the maritime and inner navigation, are the most modern of the world.
By it other, #would wish that the relative questions to the rights of boy appeared in the agenda *prioritario of the European Union, since only in this way will be able to defend our future and our position among the community of States civilised.
Base in article 235 of the Treaty in place of the 129, #can carry to exclude of program *DAPHNE #all the subjects related with violence, the sexual exploitation and the treats of women and boys, with the excuse that these subjects no *atañen to the public health.
Support categorically efforts of our two Commissions, so much Right Commission of Woman like the Commission of Inner Subjects, that, as it wanted to say, have tried to expand of different ways the proposal modified of the European Commission.
Therefore, have said that this procedure #would conduct to the absurd, and the absurd has to be always refused in interpretation of article, and much more in the case of censorship motion, that is a highly political instrument.
The aging, like the greater part of stages in life of person, affects of distinct way to men and to women, by it that no treats at all of a neutral phenomenon with arrangement to distribution among sexes.
Numerous organisations no governmental have proposed that in the next reform of the Treaty of the EU include relation of the fundamental rights of citizens, among the that #would appear the level of minimum subsidy.
The Commission proposed in Diary 2000 deepen and expand even more reform of the year 1992, especially with seen to improve competitiveness of the #european agriculture so much in the inner market as in the external markets.
In the Union promotes sale of starch and of products derived by means of helps to production *cuando said products use in industrial sectors without mechanisms of protection in front of import, #such as the chemical or pharmaceutical industries or industry of paper.
Believe that also investigation of the effects in the field that still today #can describe of product of niche, is very important, by it that #many thanks to Mr. *Garot for having put finger in sore and have forced to the Commission to take *algo with foundation and orientation.
In bottom, the subject of the rich animal feeding in proteins already treated in the agreement of *Blair *House, that takes reference to seeds *oleaginosas transformed *trituradas. But said agreement resulted so *restrictivo that finished hampering development of seed crop *oleaginosas in the EU.
Ask to the Commission #if, of compliance with the current communicative courses transatlantic in matter of agriculture, #can communicate to States Joined that these measures are similar to the that adopt States Joined, and that, as a result of *ellas, has remained suppressed the relative restriction to tonne million of seeds *oleaginosas *trituradas.
The greater part of capacity enlargements, carried out to answer to growth of demand, make at present in his greater part out of the European Union, already was in States Joined or in emergent countries like Chinese, Indian or *Brasil.
But, after all, corresponds to Parliament and to the Commission make the fine work, and, especially, take advantage of the opportunities that still exist in these markets and that no longer there #be for the massive products. In the first the opportunities #be.
*Me seems that President of Parliament, that has taken all it possible to keep colloquium out of the halls of Parliament, has not acted like President of Parliament, but like a *correligionario of Mr. *Aznar and regret it.
As *eso is particularly important before an electoral campaign, in the that #some deputies *honorarios are knowingly the title to give the impression of that they follow being deputies to this Assembly, wanted to *instarle to that it write it before possible to #all the that still have this title for *informarles on the new article and the new situation.
Now *incoaré a process in the Court of First Instance of *Luxemburgo with the question of principles: #who determines work order of deputies chosen, with type of economic sanctions, *nosotros same or the Table?
In order of ideas, gentleman President, #would fit to think #if has sense that, in the last weeks of the current term of office, this Assembly pronounce on the suspension of the parliamentary immunity of colleague that *nos took to know that it did not go to present to the elections.
From now on, from the next term of office, competitions of this commission, of this deceased Commission of Regulation, Verification of *Credenciales and Immunities, will deliver among two great commissions: the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens and the Commission of Institutional Subjects.
This strategy involves the suitability of an a lot greater efficiency in control of costs of State, of improvement in efficiency and quality of the public cost.
Is necessary to increase the percentage of participation in work markets, guaranteeing a greater flexibility of these markets, adapting the systems of social protection and reducing work costs, especially the of low qualification.
With a view to reach a *aseguramiento sustainable of a high level of employment is precise to develop a strategy to longer term allocated to discover social potentials of creativity, innovation, spirit *renovador, disposal to investment and to attainment in the sense of the guidelines of employment politics.
#If by means of caution to hour to elevate the liquid wages increase gains and investments in new places of work, no suffices with dismissing to collaborators with a gratitude by prudence shown.
will Say to conclude, gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission subscribes with taste proposal to proceed of systematic mood to an annual evaluation of the set up by States members of the great orientations, it that it #can carry out from the spring of the 2000, on the base of these recommendations by countries.
By it that refers to politics *macroeconómica, has to have an exchange of opinions among the pertinent instances on each #one of elements of the combination of political -fiscal politics, tendencies *salariales and monetary politics- so that each #one of *ellas #can contribute fully to growth and to creation process of employment.
In relation to the monetary politics, #can give the impression that exist differences concerning the previous year, because it takes into account the fact that now, to difference of the past year, exists a Central Bank independent European and no suits to interfere in independence.
#If it continues the fine collaboration of the last weeks among Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will be able to approve still before the #european elections #all the normative device for an independent office of fight against fraud.
No fits doubt that the Council, #as well as Parliament and the Commission, are #all the possible efforts directed to struggle against fraud and, especially, also out of approval procedure of the management.
Neither is of receipt that against of the budgetary rule -repeat, against of the budgetary rule- was usual, especially in the field of investigation, pay *anticipos without that know number of participants and of participants or the costs that will follow of measures in question.
But to the equal that the European Court of Accounts and probably also the European Parliament, the Council concedes also a big importance to that undertake a total modernisation and a complete reformulation of the budgetary regulation.
Happening to bottom subjects of the report that have presented and that now has to appear like annex of this resolution, had three important subjects that put of relief, #all it *cuales have remained confirmed by the report of the Commission of Experts.
The decisions on the approval of the management do not have to represent a too much heavy charge and *gravosa for Parliament, #can not get to a situation in the that no *nos *atrevamos to approve the budgetary management.
Already then, in December, in the debate on the approval of the management for 1996, affirmed since really I am surprised of the arrogance that reflects in the Treaties, that we have not foreseen the case of denial of the approval of the management.
As *ustedes know, the Commission remitted on 1 May to Parliament and to the Council a communication that indicates with precision the consequences of the entrance in vigour of the Treaty for #all the proposals that have presented with anteriority and that still have not been adopted.
My *segunda worry resides in that *colisionan two models, precisely in the case of hormones: the famous #american model, #if *me allow *ustedes designate it like this, with a different system of sanitary assistance, and the #european model that plants with more strength in *primer plane element of assistance.
It that *me concerns is the question of how will be able to *tratarnos mutually in the future and how will achieve *ponernos of agreement about a greater volume of common standards in the frame of the new commercial round world-wide and, on the other hand, how will be able to guarantee a greater grade of independence and of autonomy in self-determination of regions and of states.
#One of the most surprising conclusions was that really we did not go by behind States Joined in terrain, except an exception, in terrain of services, and in #all services from the lowest until the highest.
But, *Señorías, *cuando treats to create employment, States members have to occupy especially of the structural measures, the reduction of the labour costs, the *flexibilización of work, the promotion of work part time and, sure enough, ascertain that it remains a lot for taking in this field.
#If #this is the council that *le have given his juridical services, is also it that civil servants of the Commission *nos explained in the Commission of Subjects Economic and Monetary and Industrial Politics, and no *nos convinces of the all and perhaps #would not be bad idea go back to study it *jurídicamente.
Wanted to say to Mr. *Prodi that in Group believe that, like part of his #european vocation for a new #millenium and for the new *Europa expanded, maybe #would owe *reflexionar on the suitability to introduce in the debate the idea of a constitution for *Europa.
Is necessary to open a true new stage in the transparent and effective operation of the Commission and in relation with Parliament, so that the collegiate responsibility do not prevent the individual responsibility of commissioners.
The Greens have listened with attention intervention of today, that besides adjusts well to the letter that *nos sent and in the that loans a greater attention that in his first intervention to development sustained, to the environment and to the protection of consumers.
It true is that, by it that to *nosotros *respecta, is fundamental that President of the Commission have of a strong Commission, #such as it declared Professor *Prodi this morning, a transparent and punctual Commission in relation with Parliament, relation *jalonada by commitments that have to respect in moment and that *nos allow to work and progress jointly without *entorpecernos mutually.
Gentleman President *Prodi, *usted was proposed by the European Council in hours in that NATO attacked *Yugoslavia in virtue of the mandate of President of States Joined and of Government bosses of the European Union that *le have designated.
Has *usted now the opportunity to take it, since, in addition to explain today with the presence of #all Parliament, also finds present the majority of the political Groups that already tackled this important point in the last partial period of sessions.
stage that go to initiate now will have to be to service of the consolidation, the improvement and the strengthening of it already achieved, reform period of head until extremities, like the described #Tony *Blair.
And the impression that *nos has left is the that it has not wanted to talk of this subject. And is a pity, because clarity in these subjects is a necessary condition for acceptance of his remaining and *loables reformist purposes.
Mr. *Herman, it is necessary to distinguish among disposals planned by the annex of the Regulation for management approval and disposals planned by the annex of the Regulation for other votes.
Lamentably has not been possible to modify said amendments of commitment, *algo that it had wanted to take, and place that #can not *resignarme to vote in favour of some texts that do not guarantee that consumer #can distinguish easily honey mattered of quality honey produced in the Community, *me have abstained.
reforms of the market, that #would have to constitute the *tercer element, consist in a combination still no very defined of proposals *desreguladoras and a frame of necessary definitions for a loyal competition in the field of the only market.
Of mood that Parliament has to control the fine execution of the community budget, has to verify also the execution of his own budget by part of the General Secretary and by the whole of civil servants, #whose honesty and qualities are not in question.
In terms more general, support to speaker in #all conclusions, included the need to return the decision on the approval of the management in the exercise 1997 to the Economic and Social Committee.
*Permítanme that add it following, from the position of somebody that in the years 1991 and 1992 regretted, in the context of the #german inner politics, that had got to the disintegration of *Yugoslavia -in the that Mr. *Milosevic had an essential paper- and that considered friend of Serbian.
In the Liberal Group accept the current formulation of the report about the relative strategy to *Rusia, but wish to suppress point of postponement of the taking of decisions in this field.
In definite, the fundamental principle here is a principle that has established the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice: the principle of loyal collaboration among the institutions.
Therefore, even sharing criticisms, in bottom and in form, formulated by the speaker, am adherent of a fast collaboration and of negotiation among Parliament and the Council that allow to conclude works on the Statute and approve it.
Without valuing the position that finishes to keep on the subject that *nos occupies, yes have to say that -today like Commissioner and yesterday like member of parliament- have appreciated always, from the coincidence and from discrepancy, strength of arguments and vigour of convictions.
In this context also want to say that payment term for the new buildings has determined now definitively to 10 years instead of the 15 years previously planned. With *ello reduce the interests in some 60 millions of euros and averts an unseen loan on future budgets.
The General Secretary *nos has ensured in the debate that have had with the in the *concertación and in the commission that #this is the start of a new politics of personnel that bases especially in that the quality and no passport was the principle for a promotion.
Without embargo, the *APG that today *nos occupies already gives the first indications that the Union will have of a new financial frame, that has found a balance among rigour that prevails in #all *Europa and the financial requirements of the political key of the Union.
Tonight have in the Assembly three extremely demanding deputies, excellent and although deputies know my political record, that diverges of record of Mr. *Jarzembowski, nobody #can deny affection and respect that seat to *él and to work.
. (OF) Gentleman President, distinguished lady Commissioner, estimated colleagues, also in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens the debate was marked by the question of #if we apply here the principle of the maximum harmonisation, proposed by the Commission or #if we remain provisionally with minimum harmonisation.
Therefore, *me seems that it corresponds to the that wish a maximum harmonisation put this case no only in terms of it that it is good for the market and the only market, but in terms of how #can elevate information levels and protection in the back stages to the debate of this managerial proposal before it go back for his *segunda reading.
The idea that in any circumstance the fact to have lawyer to service *le guarantees the minimum normal protection that corresponds to consumer do not seems to be point that deserve to mention .
The long procedure of conciliation that have happened has had a decisive influence to hour to achieve that the maximum level of rests of *pesticidas in the *potitos have remained fixed in a 0, 1 *mg by *kg, it that in practice involves *potitos free of *pesticidas, as it is not possible to measure levels lower.
Certainly *usted took contribution, following the excellent work of predecessor, Mr. *Hänsch, to guarantee that, in these concrete moments, were in conditions to face up to the electorate so that we #can bear criticisms and cynicisms of the that went to be object.
The Council considers that in front of the threshold of the century *XXI, *Europa do not has to allow that they steal collectively the rights to population group more numerous in *Kosovo and that exert against #the same grave systematic rapes of the human rights.
commitment text of the European Parliament insist as in that in Colony was designated the high representative for the *PESC, that was supported by planning unit and of #alert fast and that was in conditions, by personality, to exert an important paper.
Regarding the institutional reforms, have to give the thanks to Mr. *Biagio Of #Giovanni, President of the Commission of Institutional Subjects, by the proposals that puts on the table so that they take in consideration in the new term of office and by the current and future Presidency.
The how comport the Central bank European, the how configure type politics of interests and monetary, the how expand infrastructure and #if it #would not be possible at last expand more the #european infrastructure, #all #this are things that influence essentially on competitiveness, unemployment and the situation of employment in *Europa.
The agricultural costs go to remain limited really by half term in 40.500 millions of euros to the year for market actions more 13.000 millions of euros for the rural development in the period comprised among the year 2000 and the 2006.
But still have to take more, by it that it is correct and necessary that the Council have expressed disposal to cover the need of additional credits for the *Balcanes, got the case, by means of a review of the financial forecasts.
The review clause in the sector of cereals shows that State Bosses and of Government have not excluded the possibility or even the need to introduce back improvements.
Lady Speaker, do not award my confidence to President proposed, Mr. *Prodi, because it has justified war of NATO *definiéndola as «necessary»: a #european war initiated and carried out *vulnerando a principle of International Right and despising to Nations Joined.
For *ello, is precise to reactivate the left right-separation, take of Parliament a true political instance and not looking for consensus as they have taken the Governments when designating to Mr. Roman *Prodi.
As only #swedish in the commission have followed of wall and have contributed to the debate during half year presenting, among things, amendments *acordes with the criteria of the Party of the Environment, is to say, *me have opposite to that *desligue to deputies of the constituents and of the countries members introducing wages, taxes and retirements of community character.
For the #european countries treats to refuse this logic, with support and the reciprocal cooperation of the Russian Federation in the interest of peace and of prosperity of #all.
Second: make reform of the own politics, especially in the sector of agriculture and of the structural Bottoms, by like this say it, reactivate politics and third: the *aseguramiento of finance of politics in the next seven years.
The master plan that had presented for *ello the Commission has not happened without changes the more of two years of debates in Parliament and in the Council and recognise that #this has not been advantageous for the subject in #all points.
The political and social cohesion is #one of the basic principles of the Treaty of the European Union and believe that #all the institutions of the Union have to keep firmly faithful to this basic principle.
Gentleman President, commitment of *Berlín is not to celebrate it, like commitment, and much less in my country -have to talk also like Greek- since the #greek Government has accepted regulations that *nos put to level that *España, *Irlanda and *Portugal, countries that are not so poor like the #mine and that already take part in the euro.
#There is other questions also in the that have taken important advances: by part, in it that *atañe to respect of norms of *comitología that existed, treating that they did not modify under rope norms; by #another, in relation with the participation of Parliament, with possibility to review annually the process.
*Séptimo: in the frame of the *reorientación of bottoms that, according to ideas, wanted to carry of *FEOGA-Guarantee to the second *pilar, only has gone to stop to this second *pilar a small part of it that #would have been possible #if we had imposed the *degresión.
The Council, that has ranged with this logic of the Commission has retained without embargo the idea of public intervention «*ad *hoc» in case of need and the to establish security network of 1.560 euros by tonne.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *cuando in March of 1998 the Commission presented proposals for reform of the structural Bottoms, existed doubts on #if it went to reach an authentic reform and on #if the regulations went to be able to approve to time so that the new programs #can set up to beginnings of the year 2000, according to the plan traced.
Without embargo, #can *decirle it following: are had to go back to the previous formula, is to say, that the *review for the dairy market take in the year 2003 and, of course, the Commission is also had to include in analysis the question the *supertasa in the frame of this *review .
By #all #this the instrument of the Social Bottom European is fundamental, #as well as it is fundamental that the no governmental organisations and the *tercer sector, especially of face to a politics of concrete integration, go of hand from programming stage.
Taking into account all #this, #can explain the Council reason by the that follows thinking that it is legitimate to take case *omiso of norms that establishes the Statute of civil servants #as well as of the right of initiative of the Commission established in article 24 of fusion «Treaty»?
The content of said report was debated in the Council during the deliberations on the proposal of the Commission to determine the exact rules for the structural help of the Community in the sector *pesquero.
improvement of relations, included the possible future negotiations on Trade Agreement and Cooperation, will depend of the back progresses that *Croacia take in fulfillment of the requirements established in the frame of conditions.
*Cuando tomorrow present position concerning the decisions of the agriculture ministers #as well as of State Bosses and of Government, will approve *ustedes reform in the that also #can recognise hand of the European Parliament.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, lady Commissioner, gentlemen Commissioners, east is the last big debate of the term of office, and treats of an excellent debate on a very emblematic question: Diary 2000, besides in *Berlín. *Berlín, with chancellor #german, the *Reichtag , that has been recovered, to the equal that eagle, and even war.
Gentleman President, *permítame, to avert be subjected to pressure of time, that take *algo that usually #be to take at the end of interventions, in concrete wanted to give the thanks to Mrs. *Wulf-*Mathies by his constructive cooperation with the Commission of Regional Politics of Parliament.
Like this as, in June of 1998, and of compliance with the Statement *aneja to the Treaty of *Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal to review the decision on *comitología of 1987 with the goal to simplify and *esclarecer the procedure, #as well as to open it more to control of Parliament.
Assumes a full juridical value and allows a political dialogue with the Commission in occasions in that Parliament consider that measure proposed #would provide excessive powers of application to coast of the Assembly, *algo that already has exposed of way very *convincente Mr. *Corbett.
Wanted to finalise leaving proof of the pleasure and satisfaction that *me produces all it that have reached together to hour to improve chapter of employment politics and the social politics in the European Union.
And in last place, gentleman President, because I believe that it is perfectly legitimate that #if it treats to defend the human rights -that, by true, leave enough that wish in *México-, defend much better with an agreement that include a democratic clause -as it occurs in this global agreement- that with the agreement in vigour that did not contains this democratic clause.
Also *me #would enjoy to highlight points that, to my understand, are newer inside this agreement. For example, the inclusion of the democratic clause like essential element of #the same, since it goes to promote respect of the human rights in this Latin American country.
*Yo want to *asegurarles that the Commission engages formally to keep informed to Parliament in moment -as it already is- of advances in negotiation in course, #as well as of the final result, before it subject the Agreement to the conjoint Council.
Are proud that at the end the Presidency #german, of common agreement with States members, have reached to solve big part of the complex problems derived of the confluence of political perspectives very varied that until the last moment have hampered integration of *Schengen.
On the other hand, the protection of the personal data with Information System of *Schengen is a particularly important question. do not forget, *Señorías, that the Common Authority of Control has adopted a report *demoledor.
Of side, it is necessary *averiguar how control effected by provider, that probably is the only control truly effective, #can be perfected in the future from the point of sight technical and economic.
Gentleman President, do not agree with interpretation of how take the vote on program of the structural Bottoms, because the general regulation is in fact the regulation that regulates #all the looks of the regulations of application.
But, in this case, Monday at night had varied important meetings, among *ellas the of Budget Commission, and *yo was absent of Budget Commission because it was gathered with the Commission of Juridical Subjects.
To informative title, the European Parliament has the intention, after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and enlargement of the *codecisión, to change of position on 49 first readings inscribed in the frame of cooperation and on 15 files approved in first reading to title of cooperation.
And not forgetting that, more that a happy end, the popular query will be only a step more, decisive, true is, in the already long trek that will allow that village of *Timor Oriental, after centuries of colonisation #portuguese and of century chamber of brutal #indonesian occupation, was at last owner of destination.
Believe that surely it is the wish of #all *nosotros take a call to the European Commission so that it take all it possible to pacify the situation in *Timor oriental, with the end to allow the peaceful celebration of said referendum the next 8 August.
These three questions reflect also the fundamental values that chair our Union: freedom of expression, Right State, power of village and the humanitarian looks.
In #all contacts with the authorities of the country, the Commission has reiterated posture regarding respect of the fundamental human freedoms and Right State.
Has recognised that the risks of the nuclear energy in the *Europa central and oriental have purchased a totally new dimension, although to time has ensured that negotiations with the countries candidates to adhesion open new possibilities.
In the Czech Republic have conceded helps in the frame of Program *PHARE to the responsible authorities of the nuclear security and to improve security of the nuclear head office of *Duckovani.
In actuality, no exists a formal agreement with the #czech authorities in the frame of *PHARE so that the technical organisms of security of the European Union carry out a global evaluation in matter of security.
In relation with the economic looks of project of *Temelin, the Commission supports development of a strategy in matter of energy that take properly in consideration the energetic performance and diversification of sources, and *PHARE has supported orientation in distinct projects.
In June of 1997, the Commission *nos presented two proposals to simplify the regulation of 1999, and *ello so as to relieve the obligations of companies -especially of #SME- in matter of statements and to reduce the costs that weigh on persons forced to declare.
Also give the thanks to the Commission for having engaged to carry out a study in the field of the initiative *SLIM\/*INTRASTAT referring in particular to the quality and to charges that *recaen on companies.
The High Authority, to the that delivered the social payments, appeared in last place in the list, whereas first state, afterwards the social services, afterwards supplying, the banks, #everything it that #can appoint, had priority to hour to benefit of it that remained of failure.
Mr. *Malangré has signalled it mainly in reason exhibition that, time, from perspective results *inmejorable, with the following words: already is hour that it take *algo on failure in the Community, in the #european context.
Is very *inquietante that a subject like #this was debated Thursday in the afternoon *cuando there #be here so #few persons, the vote will be tomorrow in the morning and there #be not had in breast of the national parliaments debate properly said on the subject.
As it has underlined so much the report of Mr. *Schmid like the opinion of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens, there #be a series of looks in the that it is necessary to deepen.
In the Commission of Culture *nos have put repeated times in favour that this exhibition do not show only the economic hits Europeans, but also the cultural diversity and especially the successful programs of the European Union.
In front of the disloyal imports, the textile sector, in spite of having prepared to be able to to be in conditions to confront with hit the challenge of the international competitiveness, do not has of arms with the that defend .
Of here that *urja to the Commission to that it adopt those that measured are necessary to put end to the disloyal competition that it is victim this sector and guarantee like this plenary fill of commitments contracted by #all parts in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
Have repeated in different occasions that in look of prevention have left to happen of long things in the past years and any political Group neither any Presidency #can affirm here that it has taken it all well to avert war.
Have lived the final stage, from *Rambouillet until the start of the military actions, and have not found to nobody in the western side, neither the #EE.UU, that have kept attitude actively *belicista but that tried to get literally until the last second to commitments.
Gentleman President, the Agreement of *Berlín allowed to unblock the main *dossiers of the European Union, but no guarantee the future of the European Union to long and even to half term, because the Agreement of Diary 2000 remained very short concerning the existent needs.
treats of squad of big quality, of a very balanced squad. Is the result of the constructive queries that carried out with State Bosses and of Government, the *cuales respected fully the new powers that the Treaty of *Amsterdam has conferred to President commissioned.
Today am here to present to the new Commission and no to present program, without embargo, #can *prometerles that thread conductive of #all program will be to attribute to the European Union a greater importance of face to the #european citizens.
Therefore, is task *ineludible of this Assembly give off to *Europa of this institutional difficulty in the date it earlier possible, and the only mood to take it is to take to the available Commission -do not prejudge how #can happen in audiences- and take it impossible for *asegurarnos that it go in in functions in the first available date.
Without embargo, treats of a fundamental problem: in effect, expand competitions of this institution, the World-wide Organisation of Trade, *cuando results that it has not taken a serious and contradictory evaluation of operation, *nos seems unacceptable.
Results so much more imperative what that the subject of dioxin in *Bélgica, that goes to be object of lively debates, affects, without place to doubts, directly to the problematic of the alimentary security, linked, to time, direct and obviously, with the operation of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
But, by it that to *nosotros *respecta, want *tomarnos auditions as it that they are, is to say, for *permitirnos listen to Commissioners, *interrogarlos, *formularles ask to end to know better goals and especially see until how point there #be a fine *adecuación among charges that *usted *les has entrusted and knowledges, competitions and work will.
Is necessary that the Commission endow with means to exert -with structures renewed, with civil servants, #whose disposition surely will have changed- missions and that do not hesitate in saying to Parliament and to the Council: as *nos ask that we reach goals, want *pedirles means for *ello.
Believe that, in spite of the constitutional singularity of relations among the Commission and Parliament, are founded worries manifested with a view to the political balance that exists in Parliament and that do not remains reflected in breast of the Commission.
Regarding the result, *cuando say that it is «balanced», understand perfectly that they have #some States in the that there #be dissatisfied, but #this is politics: balanced means that the great present strengths in the European Parliament are strongly represented in the Commission so much by personalities as by the importance of wallets.
As well, attribute an extraordinary importance to look, #as well as to the report of the Wise persons, but create likewise that these examinations have to take on history of Commissioners and programs and have to take with a big capacity of deepening and of political serenity, because, to my understand, #can not serve of instrument to fix problems that arose previously.
The report of the Wise persons is an instrument of big scope, have to read it and *meditar on *él, but the decision is weight that have to bear *nosotros, and is in this sense that dialogue among Parliament and the Commission purchases an extraordinary importance.
The great challenges of the future, #such as changes involved by coin only, enlargement eastwards and the fight against the international delinquency, have to be confronted with some institutions of the EU that have more capacity of action that in the present.
The renewal of the institutions of the Union is a central subject in activity program of the Presidency #finnish as it already signalled Minister *Halonen in intervention.
time finalised conflict it that has an immediate priority is to support efforts of the *KFOR to reestablish peace and order and reconstruct a civil administration that work under the direction of Nations Joined.
Regarding the statute of the #european deputies, the Presidency #finnish -and in *eso it is necessary *felicitarla- also has taken a respectful attitude with the fact that the initiative corresponds to this Assembly.
Gentleman President, listening to the Presidency #finnish ascertain the absence of substantive changes in politics of the European Union, that do not ceases to increase and aggravate the problems of villages.
Our common failure in the case *Öcalan *nos takes difficult to show clearly to persons in *Turquía, so much #if they are #turkish like *kurdas, reason are in principle against death pity and, #such as it has said Mr. *Swoboda, do not plead against death pity no only of Mr. *Öcalan but of #all.
Besides, in exercise frame of the right, owe *ocuparnos to loan type of collaboration to the International Penal Court of the Have, to pursue to the criminal that have remained in *Kosovo and, also, in *Bosnia.
#That was the message that #some expected, restless in front of informations on the absence of specific bottoms and fearing that in conditions #can drop in the temptation of *desvestir to saint to dress to #another and sacrifice actions considered essential when establishing the budget.
Of #all the promises of the #finnish Government #any is more important that the to occupy of the problem of persons -and families- that no only suffer illness or disability but also a situation of disadvantage and stigmatisation.
The Council also asked to the Commission that take a report for finals of year on progresses of the creation of Food Office and Veterinary Medicine and on the capacity of #the same to fulfil functions.
The Council demands to the Commission that take to progress work already begun by the Committee of *Piensos and Foods of Animals, in the *cual goes back to examine legislation on *piensos, and, in case, presented additional norms and reforms for a more strict harmonisation of said legislation.
It that yes know is that inspection office by the that have struggled (had to *batirnos to achieve an effective budget, so that it created the veterinary office in *Bruselas and for *asegurarnos that #would apply the principle of the general inspections in the Community) finds loomed and harassed.
And now given this situation, as we #can say that the proposal to watch to the European Agency of Drugs and Foods, by welcome that it was, #as well as #all these great gestures, #can work *cuando any individual inspector #can penetrate in universe of crime and fraud that characterises to #some sectors of industry.
*Me #would enjoy to know to where wants to get the Commission, #which are the concrete steps effected, and #if the Commission will take into account the wishes expressed by Parliament, so much in the reports on the *EEB as in the Green Book on feeding, the resolution that have formulated to the *respecto.
In the concrete case of dioxin, among the communication of the Permanent Veterinary Committee and of #alert network happened 15 days, whereas Commissioner *Bonino declared simply that *ella did not take milk #belgian.
Have the duty the responsible Authorities to delete these chemical agents of correct and safe form, following the valid rule, or are knowingly of *aplicarla and deleting these chemical agents of mistaken form?
No, gentleman Baron *Crespo, had a proposal of common resolution that proceeded of two political Groups, the Group of the Popular Party European and European Democrats and the Group of the European Party of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformist.
#This puts of relief, on the one hand, responsibility of the competent authorities for control of products. On the other hand sees clearly that the scandal of dioxin is not a problem neither failure of agriculture.
Think, for example, in sanction applied, also to *Francia, for having allowed reductions of *cotizaciones social to #some textile companies by the fact to hire personal, in the frame of an international situation, that like His *Señorías know, is very delicate, especially because of the international agreements negotiated, precisely, by the Commission.
In the first place, the proposal to put to sale the whole of the *taquilla in the #european market has not applied never in spot regarding sportive demonstrations of #this *envergadura, as it finishes it to remember Commissioner #Neil *Kinnock.
Of compliance with the agenda proceeds to the debate of the statement of the Commission on the course given to the second inform of the Committee of Independent Experts that *les has remitted, as His *Señorías had requested, it before possible.
#Can Mr. *Kinnock engage to put end with the greater possible shortness to this disciplinary procedure, after takeover, with the whole Commission like school, so that Mr. Go *Buitenen #can go back to work of form ordered and that it was rehabilitated at last?
But the true essence of #this the constitutes the Recommendation *nº 59 that requests *encarecidamente the nomination of a general public prosecutor European, that requests *encarecidamente a fiscal ministry European with public prosecutors delegated in States members to create a "area of freedom, security and justice as it states in the Treaty".
efforts *acumulativos by *modernizar have not been, therefore, sufficiently forceful to substitute a *trasnochada and deficient culture by practices and instincts of it that generally designates new public management as it has developed in the last 20 years in other diverse modern administrations.
The recommendation to establish a *fiscalía #european, as it proposes, #would mean the existence of a mechanism to interpose a *querella criminal related with fraud in the EU in #all the Union but #would not affect to the jurisdiction of the national courts.
In the report have detected a series of feeble points in breast of the institutions and the recommendations that here take sound to correct the problems.
In spite of #this *puntualizaciones, am convinced that the contribution and support of Parliament will make possible the fast adoption of the present proposal, so that it remain guaranteed continuity among the present performance of the Community and program #whose entrance in vigour proposes for 1 January of the 2000.
Go back on *ello now and remit to the majority of the Assembly the decision that *usted had taken so cautiously, only by intervention of the Socialist Group, *me seems a quite insufficient reason, in front of the principle that had applied *usted and with the that #all agreed.
Of face to this debate, *le advance that my Group will want to reach greater concretions in politics of employment, of economic and social cohesion, of modernisation of our economies that take into account to persons, to enlargement, to the Mediterranean and to defence of the human rights all over the world, like axes of our external politics.
Lady Speaker, to begin, *permítame say in name of my Group, that share fully the perspective of Mr. *Prodi that from morning will be in the threshold of a new beginning, in particular, a new beginning among our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and a new beginning for the own *Europa.
The body of the Treaties of the European Union and, in particular, of the European Only Record, of the Treaty of *Maastricht and of the Treaty of *Amsterdam have to be subjected #all *ellos to a new review in the context of the next Conference *Intergubernamental.
No *me refer to performance professional, since his personal fortune is remarkable -has known to employ very well faculties -, but that go to examine it that took *cuando was president of the *IRI, the greater economic organism public #italian, and how many *millardos -better said, talking of lyres, how many thousands of *millardos- especially of the taxpayers *padanos, achieved *dilapidar carrying out a disastrous politics.
As I finish to say, by reasons apparently *contrapuestos, because #one of the subjects that have in front of *nosotros is, expect, only the apparent perplexity and no distrust of the #european citizens, as it remained shown by the scarce participation in the *comicios of June month, although, on the other hand, there #be not doubt that it exists an increasing demand of *Europa.
appearance of Mr. *Kinnock showed like this will fault by part of the Commission to assume #all responsibility and #all the managerial competitions regarding the General Directors and employees.
deputies here present, and that have made campaigns in the that the social urgency and the fight by employment were in the centre of the debate, are *comisionados to advance of effective form to #one *Europa of employment.
section 4 of article 29 of regulation has that group statement has to indicate denomination of the group, the name of members and the composition of table.
Gentleman President, the Socialist members of Employment Commission and Social Subjects believe that Mrs. *Diamantopoulou has shown to have aptitudes and the necessary attributes to convert in a fine Commissioner of Employment and Social Subjects.
In effect, person that has to be the responsible Commissioner of the inner market and that in appearance did not stop to pronounce the word subsidiariness denotes an excessive ignorance on the great common tasks of *Europa.
Wanted to know #if, like President of the Commission, has intention to engage personally with the resolution of the *gravísimos social problems that *subsisten in the interior of the European Union and that, for the Commission, to mood to see, #would have to constitute an absolute priority.
Two weeks after it alerted to the world of the most brutal genocide as a result of the elections in an attempt to establish essence of democracy that *nosotros, like deputies, have to defend first of all, still are in deadlock and commentator *nos considers important to find a solution.
Gentleman President, today has talked long and tended on cynicism and hypocrisy of the past, but wanted to *decirle that at all is so cynical neither *hipócrita like the fact that they comment audition process those who already have announced that will vote against of the Commission.
#This has to include a consistent application of norms of competition, and also a consistent application of the Stability Pact and Growth, some minimum common norms in matter of taxes, to the equal that #some fundamental principles.
Although redistribution seems necessary to fund this new priority, it is necessary to take into account the fact that a too much great redistribution comports the risk of *desestabilizar the budgetary balance and politician in the external relations.
In this case, also have to recognise offences related with rape of the right to privacy, offences that comment intelligence services of States Joined and of the European Union the 24 hours of day.
In the space of justice #european prevention of this type of offences seems to remain only in hands of cooperation among the Police, without any parliamentary control or politician and without having elaborated at all to the *respecto.
The solution is not to employ without a purpose resources in moving to the population of the poor countries to *Europa, but devote resources to move the #european development to the poor countries.
Without embargo, the European Parliament will run the risk of remaining to the *margen of the debate while it grasp desperately to his own utopia, #that in the that citizen goes to see finally the light thanks to the advantages imposed with the #european citizenship.
Still did not takes *tantos years that the Governments of States members show had to collaborate with the European Parliament in subjects so important like the police cooperation, the migratory flows or the common politics in matter of asylum.
peace and the internal welfare are not allocated to last long, because it neither is allocated to last long resignation of a world *circunstante that lives in insecurity, the need and chaos.
And in concretion eagerness, regarding the space of freedom, believe that there are two subjects that deserve a preferential attention: harmonisation of asylum procedures and immigration *clandestina.
Is necessary to guarantee the right of citizens to receive an egalitarian deal -*access *to *justice- and to access to services of legal assistance *cuando see forced to manage subjects in front of the authorities of States members.
In the draft of the answers of Mr. *Kinnock, civil servants on had written that the problem rooted in that civil servant #dutch, Mr. Go *Buitenen, had delivered *demasiados documents to group presidents.
Gentleman President, go to begin in French, in his very beautiful tongue, to say that have the duty of *expresarle from this time on same my will of not going back to talk in tongue, while *Francia have not recognised our #basque tongue.
Yesterday same, in speech, Roman *Prodi went back clearer orientation *cuando affirmed that it was necessary "to follow restructuring the Only Market and promoting liberalisation" and underlined on purpose the continuation of the process of liberalisation of sake sectors and services.
My main consideration when judging to the Commission *Prodi is to decide #if squad of 20 persons *me has convinced that it is able to restore *tangiblemente the public confidence in the European Union and institutions.
It that #would ask to manager of the budget of the year 2000 is that it took into account the needs of the Committee of the Regions and that saw #if it fits place among places thought in the budget 2000 for the Committee of the Regions.
In this moment have already a statement of the Security Council of Nations Joined in the that condemns it that *sucedió in *Timor, recognise the rights of village and orders the sending of maintenance strength of peace.
Therefore, is necessary that #all the international community and, therefore, the European Parliament, take a call in these two senses: so that peace body go it more quickly possible to reestablish peace in *Timor Oriental and so that it #can get there the humanitarian help.
The permanent rapes of the human rights, terror against a peaceful village, miserable and disarmed have been common coin there, but existed from took 24 years: *yo saw it with my own eyes.
Want that it put term to tyranny that has suffered village of *Timor oriental during the 25 last years with help of the countries of the European Union, of *América and of #all persons *hipócritas that do not deprive to sell armaments to tyrants of Indonesian and of countries of #everyone.
#would Have to *recordarle that a socialist minister is condemned by kidnapping and that the socialist Government of leader, #Felipe *González, was condemned by the Court of Human Rights by expulsion of 103 emigrants in border of *Melilla.
Demand, therefore, of the Council an answer to this problem that go to have with the migratory population nomad in #all the European Union, an answer coordinated with States members, in the that, to time, each assume his own responsibility.
As *discierne of the statement of Gin Summit, development of the #european capacity to resolve the crisis do not alters defence systems of States members.
During the Presidency #german, on 29 March 1999, the Council ratified article *K.3 of the Treaty of the Union regarding a common position in front of project of the Convention.
Regarding the political control of squad that is in the subject, the Presidency #finnish will study the subject, but in occasion #can not say at all to the *respecto because I do not have the necessary information.
Gentleman President, believe that Mr. Deputy will know that it is not competition of the Council manage in front of States Joined the suppression of the compulsory visa for citizens of the Union, time that States Joined is not included in the list attaches to the Decree *CE\/574\/99.
In accordance with estimates of the international organisations, in *Corea of the North have died among #one and three millions of persons from 1995 like consequence of the chronic famine owed to natural causes and, besides, to character of the national system-communist in power in *Pyongyang.
*Nos will say, then, why, whereas Mr. #Solana signs secret documents of NATO that show that the *UÇK is involved in drug traffic, in prostitution and in delinquency organised, the International Strength follows *apoyándolos and the international community follows *armándolos, in place of *desarmarlos as it had agreed?
The *restablecimiento of a just democratic system is a previous condition for reconstruction program and the political responsibility is so much in hands of the EU like the social and the economic.
Think that #this is occasion to centre attention only in the main questions, #this is, that this Agency #can act inspiring in the principles of transparency and of efficiency that, given the existent situation in the *Balcanes, are an essential element.
Takes fault, as, politics integrated, a common strategy of development, of peace, of stability and of collaboration in the region, #such as it is to *delinearla the Stability Pact and Reconstruction Agency that, with headquarters in *Salónica, will be an effective agency *cuando have exactly line integrated.
In answer to the that has been a debate of big quality, *me pleases enormously company of my new colleague, Budget Commissioner, *Michaele *Schreyer, #whose presence is a sample of his big interest in this subject and in his financial and budgetary repercussions.
Has been designed to keep the necessary control of the European Union on reconstruction program and for *salvaguardar independence and right of initiative in the process.
Gentleman President, like Vice-president of the Commission has renounced to say *algo on the questions of coin and of the *UCK, #can split of the fact that no exists any opinion of the European Union on these questions?
security campaign *vial that is includes the following looks: more houses of control of speed, more proofs of *alcoholemia, a system of fines by points, a better fulfillment of the law that forces to lace security belt.
In conclusion, deputies of the Group Union by the *Europa of Nations will watch, during #all this term of office, by that the *Europa bureaucratic and *tecnocrática do not develop, but by that *Europa evolve in a harmonious frame and assumed by the group of citizens of States members of the European Union.
Think that it is important for the future of the European Union the materialisation of a free field, sure and just and give the welcome to the initiative of the Council to stand out this matter in the Summit of *Tampere.
In the *tercer, chamber and *sexto script of section 4, Parliament asks that it was the future "enclosure" the that it determine competitions of Table, #as well as the organisation of work groups and of Secretariat, it that #would suppose for #this a wide independence, for afterwards orient the process to his *antojo.
Is directly connected with effort for strengthening it inaccessible and for reinforcing control mechanisms and of repression, of course no to corroborate the rights of citizens, but for *manipularlos and like this exert a more effective control of activities.
Create, as, gentleman President, that #if we took *algo useful and durable - and #would want to listen also the opinion of Mr. Commissioner on #this - #would be that this famous organisation on the that are, to investigate the earthquakes etc. had mainly species of, #would say, code of behaviour on the composition, the publication, on when, where, how, to #who go informations on the earthquakes.
In addition to these measures, the Commission foresees the possibility to act in coordination with #FMI to concede to *Turquía helps *macrofinanciera directed to keep the reform process in some obviously difficult conditions.
A violent conflict in *Daguestán, attacked with bomb in *Moscú and, #everything *ello, surrounded of rumours on plots and prepared with theory type on it that #would have behind #this and type of relations that take with, for example, the next parliamentary elections and the attempts of distinct groups to undermine this process.
The Commission has taken part in the recent visit of the troika of the EU to *Rangún, undertaken with the goal of *allanar the path so that it initiate a political dialogue with *Birmania in accordance with it established in the conclusions of the Council of 26 April.
Maybe #would be necessary to find a less formal form of constant dialogue with *usted, Mr. *Priestley and services to argue the questions of access and #others *concernientes to the internal organisation of Parliament.
Like final point want to say *algo on the separation of rubbish. In spite of having in dispatch of two cubes for the different types of rubbish, which already is a retard in comparison with the previous situation, yesterday in the morning was witness that cubes *vaciaban in sack.
In any case, want to ask *encarecidamente that install urgently a *extractor in service to avert nuisance of it that it #can *suceder #if visitor decides to go to the just service after deputy have taken use of #the same (this problem also occurs in the *servios of the office of *Bruselas).
*Yo expect that *cuando believes an agency of foods the Commission specify the possibility to investigate *retroactivamente the *piensos employed to feed livestock and formulate disposals juridical that punish the criminal practices and *recompensen to the active agriculturalists.
Like this as, wanted to take advantage of this general debate to insist in front of my colleagues and the institutions on the need to go back to #some principles of the common sense that have seen scannings by the great theories too much economic and no very human.
In other words, mechanisms of relentless control and norms very strict. proofs made on meat of *vacuno show that #some of the cases detected do not have origin in feeding, but that owe to pollution, more in concrete to pollution with dioxins through industry or ovens *incineradores.
Is timely that the public organs and politicians, already was in the local organisms or in the governments, exert paper in the regulation of production and food preparation.
In this sense *África is the mirror of *Europa: style of selfish life in the that the pure sexual pleasure of individual converts in norm, without respect of the #another and social responsibility #any, has a very high price.

The essential principles of negotiation and approaches of solutions treated in the document of July Commission of 1999, have found fundamentally up to now a positive echo in our debates kept in the Commission of External Subjects and of Industry.
The problem, in my opinion, resides in knowing #if the World-wide Organisation of Trade works on the base of just norms so that the world, and no only *Europa, evolve to a sustainable development.
The opening of a new cycle of commercial negotiations *multilaterales is first of all a decision of President of States Joined of *América, the one who has fixed the tempo -translate: negotiation accelerated, diary tightened-, the one who has fixed the goals...
#would Have to support this round from the start, #would have to show a positive attitude to guarantee that we prevent protectionism, boost the free trade and expand prosperity of the world-wide system to parts of the world.

In Colony Council talked of the capacity of *Europa to avert crisis and to act with efficiency to hour of *controlarlas. The references to a military capacity with credibility took in the context of control of the crisis.
*Europa always has been in command of the protection of the human rights, of coexistence and of tolerance, that have taken of this territory the most advanced in it social, and #can not *permitirnos retreat in conquests, as *usted has said, of freedom, tolerance and coexistence.
The truth is that the formidable can of the that has the Central Bank European to hour to take part in front of the national economic institutions and the national banks has been collected inside diagram quite *críptico.
Regarding the insular regions, it is necessary to signal that in the Union has treated the problematic of the zones retarded; for example, in conclusions of diverse summits and in communiqués has loaned a special attention to the islands.
Subject: New community program of fight against poverty As well it knows the Council, in the frame of the Treaty of *Maastricht, did not reach progress regarding the adoption of a new community program of fight against poverty.
Exist from takes decades, centuries and thus it also is very important that in our resolution declare that the problematic has to be treated of general form, to the equal that has to look for a general solution, that was notable for the region, and of the *cual derive the stabilisation and development of the region in group.
Likewise, project signals on point of the resolution that #if, as it has said from Parliament, are conscious that from principles of century have died *tantos soldered in wars as nowadays citizens in conflicts, precisely by arms light, and #if we are conscious of the numerous arms that export, *transitan or manufacture in States members, have, then, an enormous collective responsibility.
Parliament has a long tradition in this sense, and wish *rendir homage to work of Mrs. *Adelaide *Aglietta that it was the first speaker of the report on death pity in the world of Parliament.
The Commission shares worry of deputies of Parliament, and urges to States members to that they collaborate with the #italian authorities to gather #all the available proofs so that they #can elucidate the causes of the disaster.
Lady Speaker, my Group approves fully the agreement *interinstitucional of 25 May 1999 relative to the internal investigations that the European Office of Fight against Fraud has to effect in the institutions, organs or organisms of the Communities, including the European Parliament.
But also is #likely that have gone too much fast in relation with deputies, and in this sense *me declare guilty in front of Mr. *Napolitano, president of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, since I am member of this commission, although perhaps the debate in Plenary #can *permitirnos warn #some *olvidos.
Second: the future of the electronic activity in juridical and commercial matter depends essentially of #if it reaches to improve confidence, especially the of users, in security and, in concrete, so much in the technical security, for example, regarding fakes, as also in the juridical efficiency of similar procedures.
A decisive point of support are the electronic signatures By means of a signature #such in electronic format #can guarantee that, on the one hand, is *constatable identity of the one who have issued a statement and the have signed, is to say, identity of the signatory.
Have conviction that we have found so much a fast solution as also a correct solution to boost the electronic signature and, in consequence, utility of the new means of information and of communication in the daily life.
Also is *importantísimo, as they have said orators, that have expansion possibility in the international plane because borders of the European Union are artificial borders regarding this question.
In the spheres of fast technological progress the European Union has to encourage particularly for averting #all future barrier of the inner market like result of contradictory national norms, and has to establish a juridical frame European in an early stage.
In this context wanted to take advantage of word time to stand out the possible repercussions of versions proposed "*Amsterdamizadas" -#if *me allows to use so horrible term- of the Treaties of *Bruselas and of Blunt in what they refer to the operation of part of the only market.
#This is an important proposal and oriented to the future because the gaseous fuels use increasingly -and *me refer, for example, to fuels like the natural gas liquefied and oil gas- and exists also the possibility that hydrogen use like fuel in the future.
will Say to finish, gentleman President, that the final element of this proposal is resource to a committee to keep and put of relief the technical character of this Directive, thing that already have mentioned in my intervention.
By reason support precisely this directive and, of course, also #would celebrate a lot that in European Parliament took in general *algo more in *pro of security in transport so that #this homogenise in states members, as accident figures show clearly that in this field youngsters see affected of special way.
How presupposed is #that that, among costs, forces to distinguish among two very clear-cut categories, #one - the compulsory costs - arbitrated by an authority, the Council and #another - costs no compulsory - arbitrated by Parliament?
In budget project has foreseen the creation of new places of work in Parliament and in the Economic and Social Committee, with the goal to give more efficiency to the administration of buildings.
Mr. *Pittella also has presented an extremely important report for *nosotros; therefore, *yo want to manifest my gratitude to the three speakers by the really constructive collaboration that has accompanied the budgetary procedure of this year.
From sight point believe that there #be a special contradiction among the fact to push upwards the missions assigned to the European Union, throwing downwards the necessary resources for fulfillment.
A final note very concrete, but of big importance: is indispensable to guarantee -#if it is that it has not taken already- that in the comment of line *B-7 6000, relative to the no governmental organisations, state a reference to the link committee.
*Nosotros *nos guide by these same principles but, in this case, after it that has struggled Parliament during years, this review of the agreement *interinstitucional, a review of the financial perspectives #such as it defined in the agreement *interinstitucional, is extremely important for Parliament.
Happening to the #others institutions, *cuando talk, for example, of cooperation *interinstitucional, how rigour had in information day that colleagues previously agreed that it had to take the Common Organisational Structure? or, #which is the reality nowadays *cuando decide that it is necessary to dissolve this common structure?
Is necessary to simplify a lot the juridical frame for companies -in *Europa have 18 millions of #SME, a 50% of the *cuales do not have employee-, so that they #can concentrate in the fundamental requirements, or was, in satisfying the needs of customers and offer products and suitable services.
Nevertheless, on the other hand, *yo believe that we #would have to keep the amount that the Union already has announced in the political plane, specifically that they will put to disposal 500 millions of euros for the year 2000, so as to avert cause the impression of that the Union *desdice of his political commitment.
In this context, it is necessary to have always present the fact that Government Council acts like collegiate organ, and that #all the decisions have to communicate to the public of way clear and coherent.
Finally, receive equally with big satisfaction that Mr. *Duisenberg have commented point treated in the report about the need to reduce the costs of payments *transfronterizos, especially in the smallest payments that affect to individual members.
By that, with craft presence of the Council of Ministers and of the European Commission, at present the national Governments anyway know #which are the votes, and #can exert pressures to taste, only that of form totally *incontrolable and invisible.
Since the debate of today is fundamentally among Parliament and the Central Bank and no *nos corresponds to *nosotros play any #another paper, wish to signal only, answering to worry of #some parliamentary, that will have occasion to debate here the problem of coordination of the economic politics, that is competition of the Commission.
The rise of interest types, in determined occasions #can *asemejarse or be more related with raising foot of the pedal that, by the contrary, with brake impulse of the economy and of mood advance more slowly.
Certainly have planned, to begin, study mood in that we #can create bookmark that *nos has requested like the half to keep pressure on *nosotros, in the first place, but also on #others, #as well as to guarantee that all makes with the most complete transparency possible in the immediate future.
*Nos *congratulamos of commitment assumed in the highest level to act in cooperation with the countries of origin and the countries of traffic to hour to tackle the questions of immigration.
From a point of general sight, results very significant that the Council have announced a precise calendar for the relative measures to the space of security.
In the migratory politics has been important to say with clarity that exists a basic agreement on control, on absorption capacity and of integration of a country and on the fight against abuses in this field.
The statements of *Tampere on the space of freedom, security and justice, the best access to justice, efforts by a more intense fight against criminality, are definitely positive looks of the balance.
*Me seems a fine news for the fight against terrorism, although the resolution of Parliament do not say it, the suppression of the formal procedure of extradition in the case of persons condemned with firm sentence.
Gentleman President, this High Assembly approved with big majority on 3 April of the last year my report on enlargement eastwards and the inner security. In occasion agreed to create a European Academy for the Inner Security.
With intention of *soslayamiento of States, the report *Dehaene proposes that in cases #can modify the Treaty by simple decision of the Council or even by a decision adopted so only by qualified majority, thing that results absolutely unacceptable, as it is absolutely contrary to conception of #one *Europa that respect to nations.
citizens of the Union need a democratic constitution, with a catalogue of competitions in the that responsibilities are clearly established and in the that the principle of subsidiariness have a real content.
Gentleman President, there #be dog that still has not barked in this debate, and wanted to call attention on the failure *garrafal of the report *Dehaene regarding treating properly - only mentions it of happened - the regional look of the government of *Europa.
#If it has produced delay in the nomination of a speaker has been because the representative of the Radicals in the meeting of the coordinators to choose to a speaker asked that it postponed the nomination.
The Commission thinks that the presence of States members in the Administration Council #would be in definite well for the Agency and #would facilitate coordination of reconstruction activities of the Community and of States members.
(Parliament approves the proposal of the Commission)- Proposal of decision of the relative Council to the approval, in name of the Community, of the Decision *OSPAR 98\/2 relative to the poured of radioactive waste in the sea (*COM(1999) 190 - *C5-0014\/1999 - 1999\/0096(*CNS)) (Commission of Environment, Public Health and Politics of Consumer)
Considers that the vote only constitutes a question of procedure, necessary to be able to continue negotiations with the Council regarding the creation of the statute of deputies to the European Parliament.
At present exist two problems that brake advance of the electronic trade: difficulty to verify identity of users and consumers, and uncertainty with regard to #if operations in line are legally *vinculantes.
. (*PT) The Central Bank European, in spite of exerting a fundamental paper in politics and in the #european economy, works with independence of the Council, of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments, it that results unacceptable.
Among measures, the Governments approved also common norms relative to the granting of political asylum to refugees needed and the editorial of a Letter of fundamental rights.
company has responsibility to keep to worker *empleable and worker has responsibility to take part in his continuous information and in the continuous development of capacities and of skills.
Is necessary to have an increase of power of employees and of representatives to take cost right to impugn bottom of the economic reasons that motivate dismissal, it that *nosotros call the amendment *Wolbert-*Michelin and that will propose so that tomorrow the vote His *Señorías.
Believe that it has remained clear that, motivated by the problem of the *Michelin, poses a subject that constitutes the centre of reflections in the European Union in actuality. Is to say, on the one hand, the subject of competition, and, by #another, the of the social cohesion.
Am convinced that movements by peace against the nuclear arms that so much took in the years seventy and eighty, #can restart activity in collaboration with *nosotros and Parliament, so that we #can live for real in a world #where no exist this type of arms.
Also have *presionado so that they adopt the necessary measures so that help agencies visit the zone to take an assessment on terrain of the needs and expect that this mission #can carry out in the next days.
#would Have to bet so that events like the European Capital of Culture or the European Cultural Month #can take place in *Irlanda of the North or in the Basque Country, since in this new political frame that it is *Europa #can find valid solutions for these two conflicts.
In relation with partner network, of correspondents and of organisms, mission #can not confuse - #this is an important and fundamental data, on the *cual the commission debated amply - with the mission and functions that has *Eurostat in this sector.
The Audiovisual Observatory European elaborates statistics for companies of the audiovisual industry, work of the that occupy also *Eurostat and the national institutes of statistics, and until point work and work of the Observatory *solapan.
In moment established -read *textualmente- that "the goal of the Observatory will be to improve information transfer inside the audiovisual industry and promote a clearer vision of the market, #as well as a greater transparency.
*Me explain: is a reality that structures and organisations finish remaining attached to his *financiador public, and this situation *les tends to move away of goal, that in this case is the public service and attention to professionals of the audiovisual sector.
Report (To5-0024\/1999) of Mr. *Gargani, in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on decision proposal of the Council [<lpar>$^*COM$^(<lpar>$^1999<num>$^)<rpar>$^0111<num>$ - ^*C$^5<num>$-^0019<num>$/^1999<num>$ - ^1996<num>$/^0066<num>$^(<lpar>$^*CNS$^)<rpar>$^]#\<rpar\> relative to the community participation in the European Observatory of the Audiovisual Sector
Is a question of principles that #all women and the groups that take campaign in favour enjoy of equal access to the community bottoms, especially *cuando purpose consists in allowing that the #european organisations are represented in the UN.
*Felizmente for the European Parliament the ridiculous do not kills, since it #would have to have reported clearly attitude of the direction of *Michelin, that finishes to announce a massive reduction of effective and dismissals, although the results and benefits of company have increased considerably!
Regarding the *segunda splits of the proposal, that establishes the terms under the *cuales transport #can be considered transport *ad *hoc, #as well as the procedure for acceptance of derogations, by it that to me *respecta, approve and adopt the proposal of the Commission, more severe, definitely, that legislation today valid.
security in transport always has been #one of the great worries of Parliament, independently of means used, although, obviously, the transport of dangerous commodities occupy to this *respecto a central place.
To mood to see is precisely in these fields #where Parliament and the #european politics win in credibility, because of how serve the national rules -for example regarding the transport of dangerous commodities by road- *cuando need rules to #european level?
do not takes fault that convince to citizens of the need of a common politics of environment neither of the need of a politics of #european security in terrain of the dangerous commodities.
And, in this moment, take a special call so that the Presidency #finnish carry out in the next Council the Regulation *IFOP and the Commission, gentleman *Fischler, was flexible in this text for *acercarse to the positions of the European Parliament.
Want to, on the other hand, *Señorías, a fast negotiation and want to that, anyway, have a significant economic support and sufficient for #all the sector affected -*armadores and workers- in front of a hypothetical transitory period in that it was not in vigour the right to fish in waters.
A verbal war about #which are foods more innocuous in *Europa will have an only result: the destruction of confidence of consumers in foods *provenientes of *Europa, was *cual was production place.
In front of these *interrogantes fundamental, as in the case of the *OGM, #would have to impose , as, the greatest prudence, with greater reason put that very *próximamente go to have of an effective scientific instrument, proofs *EEB, that *nos will allow to judge the sanitary state of the group of herds.
This type of contradiction among the national right and the community right exists also in the field of hunting and in #many other fields, as #if the governments signed abstract #european commitments #whose aberrant practical consequences discovered afterwards.
Nevertheless, animals injured and patients that die in stables get to the industrial facilities, and tallow of animals gets to the pharmaceutical industry, to industry of cosmetics and, therefore, to chain alimentary.
How doubt fits that the financial compensation is an important support, but, besides, the presence of the #european fleet contributes to give a greater feeling of stability in the area, it that only #can be beneficial for the international relations with *Angola.
Have taken note with interest and already have received with satisfaction the statement taken by Minister #french of Trade and Protection of Consumer, Mrs. *Lebranchu, that, referring this weekend to the unanimous report of the Managerial Committee Scientist, said that it #would reassure to consumers.
From the year 2003 #all meat of bovine will carry labeling with the place of birth, place of fatten, sacrifice place, race and age of animal.
#If to *ello join the availability of capacity installed, that #can increase given the high potential propensity to investment, consequence of his high profitability, will produce structural changes, that managers of the economic politics have to take in consideration to adopt his respective decisions.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, first of all, *yo want to manifest that Group receives with satisfaction dialogue *macroeconómico like a #worthy innovation of *encomio, since it involves for the first time to #all the main protagonists of the #european economic politics and *les engages to a direct exchange of opinions on the general frame of economic conditions.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, believe that #if millions of #european unemployed had listened this first statement on dialogue *macroeconómico to boost growth and employment, #would have carried hands in command.
Am #one of persons that, to the equal that #Stephen *Hughes, had wanted to take part the past Friday and, likewise, had wanted to follow the debate with the Central Bank on the increase of interest types.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, gentleman President of the Council has used the image of relief career to signal that the goal of dialogue *macroeconómico is to happen witness to the following runner.
#Any of the that take part in dialogue, neither the Council, neither the Commission, neither the Central Bank European, will have to answer directly #if they do not take effective some #european solutions; only to those who have been chosen and occupy seats *nos will demand direct responsibilities the constituents and constituents that *nos have voted.
*Eso poses a danger, the truth, poses a danger for the review of the general directive, of the that also is Mrs. *Smet, and is the following: the rail sector goes included in the directive.
Of course, responsibility of this situation the have politics of the governments that protect the uncontrolled action of the capital shipowner that, of multiple ways, forces to crew to work *duramente, in conditions *excepcionalmente dangerous, many times *rebasando the limits of the human resistance.
do not see, the truth, how #can supervise satisfactorily measure, because ports community and the countries of the European Community do not have real jurisdiction on pavilion fuselages or foreign property.
#If it goes out forward, #if, for example, had agreed that it was possible supervision, no fits doubt that they did not go to have day labour out of waters and ports of the European Community and afterwards *cambiarla *cuando found inside our geographic zone.
Of course, the relative questions to health and security are an important reason to limit the labour day, but fishing already is object of codes of practices and regulations supervised by the competent authorities.
The maximum labour day volunteer negotiated by the #irish medical organisation and health department is 35 hours to the week by half term in turns of 46 hours and no more of 72 hours of continuous work.
No only takes already *algún time that exists in Big *Bretaña advertising plan of data on fuel saving, but that, besides, the majority of citizens take for granted that the valid plan is consequence of a #european directive.
Gentleman President, in the first place, wish to express my more alive satisfaction by this initiative, that constitutes undoubtedly an important step to the informative transparency regarding the environmental characteristics of car and that goes, in this sense, to facilitate the election of consumer.
Have to appreciate to the Council -the truth is that time do not say it only jokingly- that it have suppressed #some of the requests formulated by Parliament in the first reading, that surely incorporated because of hastes and that neither had my approval.
Another type of measures no legislative that they #can base and reinforce the juridical frame is the *autorregulación, or better said, approach in the that the regulation and the *autorregulación are integrated, is to say in the that they appear looks regulated in legislation and, besides, distinct groups of sectors interested in reaching solutions by means of the mutual query.
Exists fear that the electronic trade was *estrangulado when being born by regulations that subject in power to dealers to 15 #european jurisdictions different, but do not offer to citizens an easy and affordable access to justice.
#This is a clear indication that it still remains path for visiting in the field of liberalisation of the postal services or at least shows that there #be determined companies of the sector that do not apply liberalisation as it is had to.
Wish intelligent models of work, like factory *desahogada, in the *cual configures work time according to employment level, in the majority of times shortens, but no always, instead of shortening unilaterally work time with a full *nivelación *salarial.
And when hearing talk to the previous orator, Mrs. *Theorin, have to say that I am conscious that the speaker has encouraged for incorporating the greater number of possible amendments. Without embargo, no longer have to include in a report #all the amendments as they present, saying two or three times it same.
Is #this reason by the that pretend to establish in the same body of the guidelines in matter of employment bond among the creation of new opportunities for the unemployed and new places of work, by part, and the quality of places and the social protection, by #another.
On the other hand, hit of employment politics is fundamental of face to a healthy development of the public finances and is logical to see the package on employment and cooperation *macroeconómica in the community context.
And in *ellas even reduces the active support to the local initiatives of employment and leaves to side any attempt to examine the quality and sustainability of work places created.
To the not evaluating seriously sustainability and the quality of growth, runs the risk of *subestimar the work that still remain for taking to confer a social character to the #european construction.
Never have understood very well how pretends to say *cuando takes reference to employment with social content, but, on the other hand, know that it is not possible assessment perspective of employment based in the reduction of the protections and of the fundamental goals of social cohesion.
Nevertheless, do not accept a key conclusion on coin only, that says that it is a fact that the realisation of the economic and monetary union creates a favourable climate for the apparition of new places of work.
Beside the evident fact that it is very important that the Union have already, as #one of goals, a high level of employment and of social protection, see that data show still a *gap enormous among the contributions made and the needs of the that suffer in families and personally the *lacra of unemployment.
The qualitative elements of this type constitute heart of our social model. In this sense will have to give form to the minimum requirements of protection and to reduction grade of the sectors submerged.
Create, therefore, that Mr. *Menrad has reason *cuando in the general conclusions takes upsetting in the need that the Commission harmonise the documents on the fundamental guidelines of the economic politics and on the guidelines for employment.
Believe that we #can be more optimistic and *plantearnos objective common Europeans in the field of information, because we #can not talk of convergence of States members #if it do not gives convergence in a so delicate field like the of society of information.
In country communists are after the fast approval of the law on the #sindical representation that also is an act of democracy in work centres.
Improve the professional insertion, develop the business initiative, boost adaptation capacity of companies and of workers, reinforce equality of opportunities among women and men; #this are the main *pilares of politics.
To the 25 years, have, as it says, "#all life by in front" , but without possibility to conceive life project, without #any another perspective that unemployment and the minimum income of subsistence, is not worse that conviction to death?
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, treats here of directive project in the frame of the program Car *Oil, that has by goal improve of here to the year 2010 the quality of the air by means of the reduction of gas broadcasts pertinent of vehicles to engine.
vehicles found in a neutral concept of fuel and technology, based in the best available technology, that will allow to States members or to the local authorities boost the use of vehicles that answer to the idea *EEV by means of fiscal incentives.
violence is a social problem of regrettable actuality that supposes rape of the human rights and attempt to health in the physical looks, mental and social, and to quality of life.
In *Portugal, for example, violence against women is *estadísticamente greater in municipalities with greater levels of life or greater cultural levels, it that no means necessarily that in *ellos have more violence against boys and women; means -in my opinion- that there #be more women with financial independence, with more culture and more value to present complaints to the police.
To *través of program *STOP and of work in the fields of the police and of the judicial cooperation, the Commission struggles actively against the sexual exploitation of boys, included pornography childish in Internet.
The predominant approach of the Treaty centres in citizen like worker, it that means that the interests of boys are not contemplated, as *ellos are not more that the group addressee of action program and some #few eventual budgetary lines.
With seen to the editorial of the Letter of the Fundamental Rights, and to the creation of the common space of freedom, security and justice have to include a special chapter on the protection of the rights of boys.
Believe that we are in front of a problem that #can analyse from two points of sight: by part, the of the fundamental rights and, by #another, the of the influence of politics relative to boys in action sectors of the Union.
Sure enough, is secret to voices that the #british Government was convinced only by means of the promise to save caution in the directive on information and query during a year regarding the anonymous society European with some minimum rights of copartnership.
#If we accept immediately the amendments and go to the negotiation table with the new proposal, go in in the process of unanimity, that already know from the principle, that as they go things, do not goes to have the results that want.
The decision of own resources that today argue, that is the mere translation by part of the Commission of the political decision of the European Council, is the best proof of shrinking.
#If we examine the cases of *Holanda and *Alemania, in #whose name there #be had *tantas complaints in Parliament, see that the Only Market *les has contributed immense benefits and have had balances extraordinarily positive in trade with the rest of the Union along the years.
In *tercer place, the put in practice of flexibility principle inside limits for the agricultural costs, proposing transfers to the following budgetary exercise of costs or of resources no used.
As I have said, in general consider a positive evolution that, because of the evolution of the market and of prices in the agricultural sector, have been necessary less credits and that have had to spend less bottoms that then #can devote to programs of external politics of big importance and urgency, #such as the that have proposed here.
The Union has fixed already #some dip clear in the energetic sphere to reduce CO2 broadcasts in a 8% around the middle of the next decade and, of course, duplicate the contribution of sources of renewable energy of the 6% current to the 12% in 2010.

The #european competitiveness neither is now optimum, the community markets do not work of form owed and has detained the *nivelación of prices of consumption sakes among States members in the zone of the *UEM.
Follows being missing a public debate in countries and a social dialogue, a participation of the regional and local field. All #this, that among *nosotros takes for granted, #can not take place there because the instruments of the EU do not allow it.

trial is in *Rusia, and already a lot before undertaking the judicial process, the European Union took a call so that person in question have a suitable trial that fulfil with rule.
Also have read with like that Speaker #Nicole *Fontaine reacted *prontamente in front of confirmation of sentence and also that #would take part in front of president of the Big National Assembly of *Turquía so that #this did not confirm the execution of death pity.
Deny the financial helps proposals by the Commission for the next three years and for the *potenciación of the Union *Aduanera #would mean, especially in this dramatic moment that sees the #mediterranean country *postrado owing to a catastrophic earthquake, contribute to increase in *Turquía a perverse spiral, #whose consequences are *inimaginables.
The Commission coincides with the Environment Commission in that conditions of the enclosed spaces *repercuten seriously on health, but do not believe that this proposal was vehicle to study how have to resolve this problem.

Believe that it #would be positive, and also have posed it in the commission, even have sent a letter asking why #can not use signal, warning signal, the *pictografía that uses in the world of the international transport.
Like speaker, #would agree with the amendment 23, #if to the introductory part, that is object of this amendment, *le add three words: Then the amendment #would remain as it follows: " special climatic conditions of some alpine zones or of comparable zones to the #mediterranean and #nordic regions" .

Gentleman President, the current common organisation of markets had given samples of exhaustion, since it was not able to answer to the new challenges of a market like the of products *pesqueros, very *globalizado and competitive, in a European Union very dependent of imports.

This explanation of vote do not alters posture that have shown previously as a result of the processing by the European Parliament of the report of Gentlemen *Dimitrakopoulos and *Leinen on the *preparativos of the next governmental conference.
In effect, the transitory period of three years will have had, at least, merit of *demostrarnos that #can live very well, on the one hand, with a euro with own life -that, besides, is rather chaotic in the international markets- and, on the other hand, with some national coins that follow in circulation, for greater satisfaction of consumers.
Gentleman President have voted against of the Inform Towers Mark relative to the introduction of the euro, because my party, the Socialist Party of the Low Countries, always has been contrary to the introduction of a community coin.
Therefore today, to the equal that the Council *Ecofin of the European Commission and that #ours speaker, think that the reduction of the transitory period of three years #can arouse technical difficulties very important, that #would put in danger the process of the step without setbacks to the euro.
The dynamic performance of the Commission in narrow cooperation with the delegation of the European Parliament has put of self-evident that the Commission with his complete strategy of negotiation had tended rails that #would conduct to a possible hit.
Although it is fundamental to centre in procedure details, improvement of the organisation will compensate the greater loss of *Seattle, the loss of political conviction in merits of liberalisation of trade opened and based in disposals *multilaterales.
Finally, members of the *OMC owe at last listen to the 1.200 no governmental organisations of almost 100 countries that have signed a statement demanding that it do not follow advance with liberalisation until they examine the social and environmental repercussions of the current liberalisation and solve the problems.
As very well has explained Mrs. *Pack in intervention, have got to an agreement that, for #all *nosotros -and like this have said it clearly members of parliament-, is an angular stone in the construction of a *Europa of citizens.

*Cuando think that only the 30% of fuel transport passes *circunvalando Swiss, then have to take use of contingents to go back to apply the shortest path possible in place to load in excess to the peripheral countries further of any statistics.
substance, used like *desinfectante agricultural mainly in zones very delimited of crops of #mediterranean regions, has already commercialisation and utilisation severely restricted in my country and has been already substituted in #all the cases in that it has tested the existence of suitable alternatives.
The amendment 27 #would introduce a procedure accelerated to include in the new rule substances that exhaust ozone coat, it that it #would be of utility to postpone investments little careful, to time that benefits to ozone coat.
In fact, members of the commission consider that in these moments the European Union is the subject of the genetically modified foods of a quite garbled way.
Because, ensure it, my opinion is that heel of #Achilles of the regulation, that besides believe that it opens the doors to the legal adulteration, to transgression and to distortion, is that it is not possible to define in compound foods how and how much contain of product altered genetically.
Thus *me amazes that it say that lady Commissioner *Wallström do not wishes to expect to the definite review and that in place has backed offer of industry to fulfil the review of the directive on *OGM, already before approval.
With amendment proposal of the Regulation *nº 1139\/98, by the that it establishes some minimum limits of the adventitious content of material *GM authorised, answer to the mandate of the Council on labeling of the alimentary products produced from *OGM.
*Me cheer that the European Council have fixed the great lines of the new #european politics of security and defence developing, in particular, the capacities military and no military of fast intervention of the Union.
Collecting the wishes of Parliament, also will comment the opinions of the Presidency on the situation of *Chechenia and will review the most important results of the summit of the *OSCE celebrated in *Estambul in the month of November.

How has escaped of control of the Union the Anti-doping World-wide Agency, that acts like doctor and supervisor of illnesses of sport, on the that presented a report the 1.12. Commissioner, Mrs. *Viviane *Reding, and in the that the Union had to exert an important paper?
will not be able to prevent the every time greater inequality among citizens and among societies, #if we are not able to regulate the minimum taxes in #all the zone of the internal market.
Seat a cultural community much stronger with Turkish and the *kurdos progressive that struggle in favour of justice, freedom and democracy. And is for me reason of joy that day *les #can give the welcome to a community of #european cooperation.
In this question reached to reach the goal that the Presidency #finnish had fixed, to know: already in the Conference celebrated previously in *Helsinki, States members and the countries associated agreed in that it is necessary to trace an action plan.
The example of the *OMC has shown that the #european chains #can have had an a lot greater presence and that it is important that are in the first line of the informative coverage #if we want to exert paper leader in the world.
do not considers the Commission that companies in question use offer to make new dramas of infrastructure to protect monopoly and that said dramas #would contravene the political European favourable to a balance more *ponderado among the distinct means of transport?
But wanted to add it following: by #a lot of that it invest in infrastructures -and in the conference of donors that will celebrate to beginnings of the new year will examine the concrete promises-, by #a lot of that it spend in infrastructures, it decisive is to boost trade wider and free among the countries of this region and even inside #one or two countries of this region.
To time, the Commission will follow accompanying process of political reforms and economic in country according to the valid agreement of cooperation and by means of program *PHARE or the new financial instrument that *substituirá to *PHARE.
In conclusion, gentleman President, the Commission do not considers that the new politics in matter of vertical restrictions #can cause in the sector of beer and in the sector of hospitality industry in *Bélgica important structural changes that put in danger culture of beer in country.
treats of small and medium enterprises that, with a high level of efficiency, require so #few employees that fulfil the criteria of the EU for the granting of state helps to #SME, but that, to time, #can compete in inequality of conditions and cause distortion of competition in the market.
Little satisfactory because -as it also has seen in the Summit of *Helsinki- have a Council that takes promises with a big joy and afterwards the budgetary authority, of the *cual in any case also forms part the Council, has to look for way that all go back to square.
The European Council of *Berlín obsessed with the budgetary cuts, no only initiated the decline of endowment of the structural politics with regard to levels reached in 1999, but that forgot that it had politics community.
The already poor countries of the region are even more poor, conditions of life of population see aggravated and bombs have not put end to the opposite chauvinisms.
Gentleman President, to measure that expand competitions of the European Union also grows the importance of the Court of Accounts European, that from the Treaty of *Maastricht is an autonomous organ of the Community.
The facts of the past year highlight the need that have an able Court to criticise in case necessary so much to the Commission as to States members that, after all, are responsible of the management of the 85% of resources, roughly.
Nevertheless, know that it is in mood compulsory for the European Union, according to the Convention on the Rights of Boy of Nations Joined, that Commissioner was in conditions to inform about it that is in favour of boys.
harmonisation process has the purpose to reach the most elevated levels of security and of environmental protection and represents an important inducement of face to the quality, with advantages so much for industry as for consumers.

Therefore, in the Environment Commission, follow proposing the renewable energies and that adopt clear measures in transport; no only in transport by road that is the that more broadcasts of CO2 produce, but also in the aerial transport that also generates broadcasts and, up to now, has not priced as it had to.
#Such as it signals in the resolution, believe that it has got hour that the EU show the path to follow and that *atreva to be in the avant-garde, that leave after yes to #EE.UU., with will fault and with his *inflexibilidad, and that ratify the Agreement of *Kioto beside countries.
#This affects, especially, to contingents of waste trade and material *contaminantes, the *cual is a half effective to reduce wastes *contaminantes, always that it regulate for trade a clear rule based in the mechanisms of the market economy.

Gentleman President, the representatives of 189 countries adopted in 1995, during the *cuarta World-wide Conference on Woman, organised by the UN in *Beijing, action platform and a statement by the that the Governments participants engaged to improve the situation of women.
Owe *recordarles that under the Presidency #spanish of the Council the EU pronounced with an alone voice in favour of woman and that, thanks to firmness, #can tackle important points in negotiations, that afterwards remained reflected in action platform.

In how fields have progressed States members, where have to put more of part, where need more efforts so that the European Union #can achieve in New *York an improvement of the situation of women in *Europa and in the rest of the world?
The debate will restart -lady *Theorin, perhaps was #this question- after the statement of the Commission and alas also after the debates of the Report *Papayannakis and of the Report *Keppelhoff-*Wiechert, but anyway will restart before question turn foreseen for the 17.30 hours.

is not natural, is not normal, had account of it that each #one represents, in this Assembly, from sight point of convictions, of currents of ideas, that the left and the right #can not be entirely of agreement on these questions?
put in relation the reproductive health with the human rights, since it established that the human rights of woman include right to control and decide free and responsibly in subjects related with sexuality, is to say, also the sexual and reproductive health.
In effect, the Commission has adopted the approach of the stick and carrot: carrot have been the great efforts to gather to parts and achieve that they approve a solution through negotiation.
It that has carried to *Francia to this decision is insufficiency of the guarantees regarding the definition and to program application of medical proofs, and especially the absence of regulation in matter of labeling and of *trazabilidad in the #european plane.
On the other hand, *acaso the Commission and the Council do not continue *oponiéndose, with reason, to the lifting of the embargo on meat of bovine treated with hormones, pertinent of States Joined, in spite of the *exhortaciones of the *OMC, basing in a similar reasoning to the of the #french Government?

The proposal of the Commission of a directive on delay of payments comprises a group of measures to struggle against said delay in the commercial transactions in the European Community.
Seems to have agreed that #if *nosotros present amendments to regulation proposal of the Commission the Council will not approve the procedure simplified, to know the approval of postponement procedure in the frame of the *codecisión.

In December of the year happened the majority of this Assembly *denegó the approval of the management and returned to commission because it had problems of procedure that now have resolved, when modifying Regulation so that it was in accordance with disposals of the Treaty.
Regarding the Court of Accounts, only want to say that the typical demonstration of budgetary insufficiency has been able to resolve *favorablemente, and almost without effort, in the year 1997 thanks to the favourable evolution of the euro -of the *ecu, in moment- concerning coin *luxemburguesa.
By reason, the Council and the Commission, but also Parliament, have to take into account it that have decided in the Report *Tatsos, for example, in relation with finance of the parties, and have to proceed of equal way in square provision and in promotions.
Pose the presentation of censorship motion. *Ello carried out on 11 January by 70 deputies pertaining to #all the political groups, those who bore then convictions of type, especially by part of President of the Socialist Group.
No the problem resides in that 1998 has discovered and *yo wanted to *pedirle, gentleman *Liikanen, that communicate to colleagues that in day, in the summer, had breakfast up, in floor 7 -then #this left really with confidence and friendship- and *les took the following offer: are *ustedes frank, *confiesennos errors, show failures, are had to establish commitments.

Finally, it that *me has surprised and disappointed a bit also, is the fact that the Commission have not remained with control of the evaluation, that it yield control to States members and of form also the initiative for new proposals.
The opportunities to introduce radical reforms that offers this new beginning only will be able to take advantage of fully #if the three organs involved -the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission- keep a narrow collaboration in a climate of full confidence.
#There is had five years of absolute lack, five years in that the #european Constitution has been *tabú, and now spokesmen of great groups *nos give like the fundamental element of work of the Commission the preparation of a #european Constitution.
#This no always has been like this in the past, and the question of the commercial conflict on banana imports pertinent of the countries *ACP *nos leaves a bitter flavour.

But have, to finalise, a question for Mr. competent Commissioner, since the Directive 77\/537 on measures that have to adopt against broadcasts of *contaminantes pertinent of the engines *diesel allocated to the propulsion of the agricultural or forest tractors follows valid.
But as it knows, situations of crisis #can also release strengths and deploy a special dynamics. The Presidency #german has confidence in taking justice to responsibility in development of the European Union for *convertirla in a community *paneuropea and to time with capacity to act as a whole.
Is necessary to remember that, from sight point of Parliament, #would have been preferable to leave #this in hands of the Commission and not following -as it said Mr. *Santer- converting to the Commission in Secretariat species of the Council.
Need a new Treaty, today, and it more important is to give exit signal and indicate with accuracy the path to follow, mark guidelines that have to come of Colony, especially because the public opinion, with the #sad experience of *Kosovo, shows that it is more sensitive that before to paper that *Europa #can exert.
The external politics and of common security always has been *algo #as well as stepson of the #european cooperation, among reasons because #some of States members greater have wanted to preserve the own primacy.
The *preponderancia of the practical Europeans regarding the labour market has to remain patent in the fact that a true dialogue among the organisations of work market *nos will allow to keep growth and the creation of employment.

The upper limit of costs of the EU follow being of the 1, 27 % of the gross social product of the European Union and this upper limit neither goes to follow being employed totally.
Here, the Commission coincides fully with the European Parliament and am safe that Parliament goes to follow being watchdog also in the future so that have sufficiently in account in the daily practice of the application of reform of the structural Bottoms.

Under the Presidency #british, for example, reach to introduce agreement very expected on the guarantees for consumer by the that they establish the rights of consumer *cuando #this buys sakes of consumption in point of the only market.

The speaker already took part in day in invention of method of the financial perspectives with occasion of the budgetary crisis of 1987-1988, the that carried to the called «package *Delors *I», and also was speaker of Parliament for the agreement of 1993.

Regarding the transitory regulations on the that has talked here or to the fact that they have to exclude, no treats of maliciousness but that it is reflection that the regions have made progresses and that we have to *ocuparnos first of the poorest and not following helping to the rich that get slowly to reach the average.
To time do not owe *escatimar efforts to reinforce element of prevention, to prevent, in the first place, that persons lose work places; argument very very defended by the speaker.
With regard to the external actions, exists the clear commitment of the Council to fund the additional needs that derive of the situation in the *Balcanes, in case necessary, through a review of the financial forecasts.
Expect that negotiations on finance of the European Union for innovative projects of the *RTE in the current European Council confirm the importance of #Galileo for the #european producers and the #european users.
With news of today of *COREPER that the Council is had to give approval to commitment reflected in the amendments that today have in front of *nosotros, #can confirm likewise the full support of the Commission to the position of Parliament.
*Yo #would want to finally appreciate to Mrs. Commissioner the efficient work that has taken so that the new regional politics, the of the period 2000-2007, go tied to name, in the sense that the #his has been an important contribution.
Subject: Development of section 2 of article 299 In front of the imminent entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, how measured prepares the Council for development of section 2 of article 299 relative to the statute of the regions *ultraperiféricas?
Gentleman deputy, in question has described of a very precise mood the problem that have and that have not been able to solve up to now; on the one hand, want to protect to banana producers that are especially linked to *nosotros but also have to respect norms of the *OMC.
Parliament has been an important voice to hour to define the guidelines of this reform, but has to be it even more in application during #all programming period.
Maybe was #this my last intervention, because #if well I will go back to be available, my party do not goes excessively well, and therefore my last call to the Commission is the following: Are especially attentive to #all #this; expect that, in case of not going out reelected, *algún day #can read in the press that *me have taken case.
And are not positive looks like the maintenance of the community initiative *URBAN, by it other, against the opinion of *Berlín, the that they will be able to modify a position of deep doubt concerning goodness and efficiency of the future regulation of the structural Bottoms.
Gentleman President, after the taken care style of Mr. *Martinez, *me fear that posture goes to seem very spent, because *yo really believe that the agreement on Diary 2000 reached in *Berlín, to weigh any complementary imperfection, remains registered in the active of the Presidency #german.
*Casandra has mistaken and have confirmed, so much the priority that has for the European Union the politics of social and economic cohesion, like the admirable and, especially, effective collaboration among the upper organs of the Community.
In the report on the northern dimension of the Union mentions that, of compliance with it adopted by the European Council in *Viena, this dimension has to be also present in #all the decisions related with the inner development of the Union.
And for the group of *Europa, offer guarantees to tackle zone needs gravely affected by poverty and the abandonment, without forgetting help to the great regions that suffer the industrial deterioration.
Concerning punctual details #can take trials differentiated, but there #be *algo that it has to remain clear: that we have kept the calendar is an enormous benefit, so that this review of the structural bottoms in comparison with the of 1994 #can establish to time and go to avert go back to drop in the dilemma of five years ago.
Always *nos have declared in favour to impose the strict application of the criterion of a regional #GDP *per *capita minor of the 75 % of average community for the election of the future Objective regions 1.
*Me give account of it difficult that *les results to my colleagues of States members comprise how much have dropped wages of agriculturalists of my country, *Irlanda, to cause mainly of the fact that this country depends enormously of export markets, so much in the EU as in third countries.
As any #another agreement in the frame of disposals of social dialogue collected in the social chapter, #this illustrates also a new facet of the democratic deficit, #such as it already has explained the speaker.
Finally, the Commission entrusts in that Parliament will consider timely to issue his *dictamen satisfied so that the Agreement #can go in in vigour, and appreciates once again the important backrest that has received in moment of Parliament, no only for the strengthening of relations with *México, but also for the establishment of a true alliance among *Europa and *América Latin that, little by little, goes forging.
*Schengen is, therefore, #one of our greater worries so much regarding freedom of circulation of citizens of the Union as to freedom -that is indivisible- of citizens of the third countries that live in regular situation in #any one of the countries of the Union.
The only area in the that the Environment Commission, #whose opinion represent, and *yo same dissent of friends and colleagues of the Commission of Juridical Subjects is in the subject of #if we have gone by the good path regarding protection of consumers.
The directive no treats -on the other hand, #can not take it- to question it that has achieved through rule on author rights and rights *afínes, approved takes little, neither pretends -wanted to *recalcarlo in concrete to Mr. *Hoppenstedt-apply to it already regulated and harmonised with the Managerial «Television without borders», neither review definitions already consolidated in #the same.
Want to express my gratitude to #all #that that with collaboration *me have offered a so fruitful experience, for me unforgettable, and expect that it continue attributing to these subjects the decisive space that *les corresponds, with the determination and with coherence that recognise unanimously to Parliament.
treats of *incentivar the citizen participation in the #european plane and to guarantee the rights of persons to prevent that it #can prevail a negative evolution of characteristics.
Believe that it is necessary to take in consideration the following element: the agreements *interinstitucionales modify -by means of the consent of the institutions- distribution of the annual budgets and form part of vision of the budget, vision that have accepted of common agreement.
treated of #one of the priorities of Group of the Party of the European Socialists, #whose approval had reached in Plenary of *Estrasburgo of 19 November 1998, and that we had to take accept by the Commission and the Council.
The Report *Aglietta, that claims for the European Parliament the right to interpose in execution measures, specifically to *través of the *otorgamiento of power of *revocación, *nos seems, as, that contradicts the philosophy of the current institutions of the Union.
Is particularly lucky can take it *cuando lives a decisive moment of the process, with the signature of the agreement reached in the frame of Nations Joined, in that it recognised the possibility that village *timorense decided freely future.
By the wilful refusal of the #indonesian Government, the questions related with security and the creation of a climate of peace and without *coacción on the population are not properly guaranteed.
Gentleman President, do not know #if #this is my last mandate. do not know #if #this is my last speech, but in any case, are #where was, will remain at the side of #that that struggle by the right of self-determination of villages and by the human rights, by the that *yo also will follow struggling, since *Timor Oriental finds in #one of these situations.
Gentleman President, the Commission, of course, congratulates by the historical progress that has made in the final round of conversations *tripartitas celebrated under the auspices of Nations Joined in New *York by the #portuguese and #indonesian Governments to resolve the ancient, delicate and dramatic problem of *Timor Oriental.
Very probably had produced climbing of conflict and the decision of the Palestinians perhaps #can increase the necessary mutual confidence for a durable peace.
Europeans that have lived the *Segunda World-wide War and the period of *Hitler always will experience a deep feeling to the #jewish victims of persecution, especially those who, as *yo, had friends that lost life in catastrophe.
But in bottom have taken the word to appreciate in name of my Group to two members of this Assembly that, in this sense, have delivered in body and soul to defence of the rights of the Palestinians.
Gentleman President, the European Commission thinks also that the #palestinian managers have taken a decision hit in interest of the #palestinian village when postponing the proclamation of State announced for 4 May.
#If this year 2000 has a big symbolic value it is necessary to take advantage of it really to send this message of universal character: a moratorium for #all the cases in that it exists conviction sentence to death.
This *intergroup that occupies of the International Penal Court says explicitly that justice -Mr. *Dell'#Alba is #one of promoters of this *intergroup - has to protect in a juridical foundation. In the majority of the cases exists a juridical foundation to diverse levels, as *sucede at present in *Kosovo.
Believe that #this is reason by the that #many of conflicts that have produced in the last ten or fifteen years have been *dirimidos with arms and have not been resolved in the frame of a Court or a Penal Court.
action of the transnational Radical Party «there #be not peace without justice» has contributed in part to take advance the that, in my opinion, is #one of the most important messages that #can direct at the end of a century that has been the more *sanguinario of history.
Takes #some days reached an agreement mark -graces also to the discreet but *importantísima work of President #Michel *Rocard, to the one who congratulate- that it constituted and constitutes a fine base to reestablish the necessary conditions for coexistence among the varied islands and the same existence of State in the *Comoras.
On the other hand, the Commission is, with States members, the possibility to initiate diplomatic management with seen to the application of the celebrated Agreement in *Madagascar on 29 April 1999 under the auspices of the *OUA.
Coincide with the speaker in that the result of negotiations with the social speakers is so deficient that poses the problem of the democratic deficit regarding legislation based in the social dialogue.
The integrity of persons has to constitute an increasingly important factor in the debate on measures against delinquency, for example, by means of a more rigorous inspection of data.
With reason the Council and the Commission asked a decision to the European Parliament about compensations and quota of potato starch. Was simply a requirement so that it exist a fine administration.
Lady Speaker, always *me have felt proud that in the common agricultural politics achieved to join, reasonably, the interests of the first producing with the of industry *manufacturera, but to time giving a big balance to the interests of consumer and of the taxpayer.
Of compliance with the Agenda, proceeds to discussion of the report (To4-0195\/99) of Mr. *Hoppenstedt in name of the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education and Media, on the Communication of the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament «*Expo 2000 *Hannover» (*COM(99)0131 - *C4-0153\/99).
Has to carry out a renewal that *le allow that products or services are able to have, in the frame of a global economy, a sufficient acceptance as to reach a fine participation in the international markets.
Then, the Commission *recobró enthusiasm, no against States that refuse the introduction of social and environmental clauses in rule of the international trade, but against States members.
To the treat of the last planned session for the present term of office, propose to his *Señorías separate of section 2 of article 133 of the Regulation and approve, from this moment, Record of the present session, that has gone drafting to measure that developed the debates.
The European Parliament has visited a long path from 1979 up to now, and in #Nicole *Fontaine have the suitable person to conduct to a good future competitions, faculties and the dignity of Parliament.
*Nos seems *importantísimo that now put order in Parliament so that trip that costs 300 euros was not *reembolsado with 1.000 euros and of form wage go in by the main door and no hidden by means of benefits in species by the rear door.
members of the EU no only kept unit and performance capacity in this extraordinarily difficult stage, but that also showed a high constructive capacity.
reason *estriba in that war of *Kosovo went back to put of self-evident bottom goal of the #european integration, that is the construction of a durable peaceful order in our continent.
In *tercer place, with the end of the *cuarta and expect that last #yugoslav war in *Kosovo and the adoption of the Stability Pact, the *Sureste European has now, for the first time in history, a true opportunity to leave definitively backwards nationalism and violence and add to the *Europa of integration.
Therefore, in the future will be *ineludible enlargement of the rights of the European Parliament further of the new disposals of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, but also a more adapted participation of the national Parliaments.
... but #if Mr. *Poettering devotes to proclaim that the Federal Chancellor German did not interview with commissioner designated before nomination, *yo owe *recordarle that the previous Federal Chancellor *Kohl talked very often with Mr. *Bangemann and already sees the results that obtained, or was, absolutely #any.
The decision to proceed to a military intervention to close the step to a racist politics, nationalist and of ethnic deportation in the *Europa of the century *XXI was received, as *ustedes know, with diversity of trials in the Group of the Greens.
disarmament, prevention of the crisis and the civil resolution of conflicts, particularly through an intensification of paper of the *OSCE, run the risk of remaining abandoned in the ditch.
*Me seems -and treats of #one *segunda education of these #european elections- that in numerous countries, in particular in Big *Bretaña and in *Francia, the voters have manifested a *euroescepticismo in increase and believe that, when voting by the parties of the opposition in the great #european countries, to *Europa, in the that take part the Governments, is to the that citizens have wanted to sanction.
#Can that yes, from sight point of intention statements, without embargo, *nos seems that all follow being very *nebuloso before being able to affirm in how dates the Union will convert in a subject autonomous politician with his own external politics and of security.
Nevertheless, intervention of today *me has affected a lot, as it has said #a lot of more things that the fact that it represents to the greater political Group of this Assembly and that has got to a coalition with the Liberal for the election of President of #the same.
In definite, it that *les interests is not #who resolves problems, but the fact that at last somebody occupy of these problems, that consumers #can *fiarse of foods that buy, that travellers take plane with confidence, that the world of sport was clean.
Now treats to concentrate #all energies in the really important tasks: reconstruct the house of the one who has found without home, *recomponer the communities destroyed and, it more important, have to offer to the *Balcanes a political and economic future clear that put end to *tantos centuries of continuous conflicts.
Have been so busy *reconstituyéndonos *nosotros same that still have not been able to take the duties and the owed investigation, so, #if audiences take out to the light question of importance and of public interest that still *desconocemos, this Assembly will have the have to bear with *Europa to act, and will act -of course, my group will take it.
Parliament has matured in the last months and have learnt a basic lesson for the coming years: no longer are partner of less category of the #european political institutions.
The systematic rejection by part of position Commission of the European Parliament -even adopted by overwhelming majority- is not a fine attitude and the ancient Commission is manager of *ello, wish to signal it.
#This is the vision, the challenge and for *nosotros -*nosotros the radicals- criterion, a very clear approach, the federalistic approach of *Altiero *Spinelli that *nos will allow to know #if our Institutions leave or do not leave to the *reforzamiento of the Union, to more *Europa, to the *Europa political.
In the long run, am convinced that, while it put car in front of horse -with the Commission exerting a greater influence on the formulation of politics that the elect members of Parliament-, citizens of #all *Europa will follow showing apathetic to this institution.
Know orientations that *usted treats to give to the Commission and that today has completed and required in it to reform of the Institution refers, and *usted knows orientation and the political worries of the European Parliament.
Without embargo, think that it is necessary to underline the suitability of *evidenciar reasons by the *cuales recently has talked also of a Pact by Employment, #as well as the need to loan attention to the regional disequilibriums that exist in *Europa.
The Presidency #finnish of the EU, together with the Commission, #would have to study how progresses are in this important subject in #all the European Union so that worries of consumers on the new coin are fully attended.
Agree with #this, had as we are to take part in solidarity process among States through an External Politics and of Common Security by the that my Group struggles from the principle of presence in the European Parliament.
By reason, on 29 June the Commission has demanded to the competent #turkish instances that take into account this rejection of death pity by part of the European Union.
Regarding the institutional subjects, the Presidency #finnish has an enormous responsibility: the to set up works that will carry to the conclusion of a statute on the fundamental rights.
Gentleman President, lady minister, coincide with *usted in that sentence to death of the leader *kurdo Mr. *Öcalan puts to the international community in front of an important challenge, since it violates the minimum requirements of justice #as well as of respect to the human rights.
By reason, in spite of rape of the human rights and of the ethnic cleansing against the *kurdos by diet of *Turquía, Group do not requests that the European Union neither NATO bomb *Turquía.
And to *ello it is necessary to add the requirement, by part of the European Union, that Government #turkish have a conversation with the *kurdos, by means of dialogue that achieve a solution for claims *kurdas of autonomy inside *Turquía, #as well as respect of his democratic rights.
gentleman Commissioner *Bangemann manifested in letter dated on 29 June and directed to the then President #Gerhard *Schröder intention to go in to service of a private company of communications, to know, the #Telephone #spanish company.
This crisis has influenced negatively in exports, and #some measures taken by commercial partners of the Union have *desbordado the real proportions of the crisis in looks, so much by the gravity of said measures as by his practical applications.
Alas, the Commission was not informed on the problem by the #belgian authorities until 27 May. Immediately, set up #all a series of measures with the end to protect health so much of persons as of animals.
Have to establish a juridical base to use protection clause in case of dangers that arise in the European Union related with edible products for animals and that they #can represent a serious risk for the health of persons or animal #as well as for the environment.
To *ello added the fact that the decision of the Community on the withdrawal of product markets potentially contaminated was executed by part of the #belgian authorities of an entirely insufficient mood.
failures have caused a dramatic situation, in the first place, of course, for the public health and second have meant an economic disaster for agriculture and for #all the alimentary sector.
Parliament has to to the #european citizens *algo more that the simple complaint of a criminal act, as in the case of *Bélgica, that, on purpose, Mr. Commissioner, has not taken publics still the names of companies that used foods for animals contaminated by dioxin.
Accepting contrary rules to our interests and disposals #such as sufficiency of the scientific proof, that *nos forbid in practical apply the principle of caution, the previous Commissions have caused *estragos considerable to society and to our economies.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *Europa knows, already from takes #some years, a succession of alimentary scandals: had cows crazy»; *nos interrogate on the *OGM and labeling; at present experience the problem of the animal flours that contain dioxin; see that they withdraw of sale drunk very common because they cause problems...
Of here that the Commission have to draft and formulate proposals to take a positive list of matters prevail authorised for the animal feeding, accompanied of a study on the incidence in production costs of feeding grazier to avert incompatibilities with the *PAC.
Have received six amendments and, once again, as I finish to say it, only reflect distribution among political Groups, is to say the exchange of charges in the interior of a same group or well add a nomination in place that found vacant.
The European Parliament, #as well as numerous associations of consumers, has had the opportunity to give elements of answer that are #others *tantos indexes posed to carry out reflection in favour of a new definition of the alimentary approach of the European Union.
treats give priority to the interest of consumers, to take that it prevail the principle of caution on any #another principle and establish control integrated of the whole of chain alimentary, of producer to consumer.
Lady Speaker, in this Assembly has converted in species of tradition that deputies put in foot to say that name do not appears in assistance list of the previous day.
The Commission considered that factors -the application without precedents of the law, the relative conventions to previous sales of entrances for international tournaments and the constructive action of the *CFO- justified the *imposición of a symbolic sanction, more that of punishment.
Wanted to signal that the coasts for deputy that took part in said legal action were of order, oh surprise, of the 1.000 pounds, a quite greater sum that fine imposed to the organisers of Glass of the World.
Is a universal feeling in the Commission, reason by the that my colleague Mr. Go *Miert and collaborators of the Commission tried specifically take *algo effective bear, once and for all, avert in the future and also in 1998 the application of discriminatory practices by part of the *CFO.
*Cuando listened #some of interventions made in the course of this debate, #can not avert the feeling of that, sometimes, the first victim of football is the truth, because there #be had #one or two interventions loaded of passion, but that in general did not recognise the facts.
*Les remember that in meeting of Thursday 9 September, the Conference of Presidents had decided to subject the question to the Commission of Budgetary Control, so that it elaborated a report.
. Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the Commission received the past Friday the text of the second inform of the Committee of Independent Experts, that analyses the administrative management of the Commission and formulates proposed of face to reform.
In my modest opinion, like Commissioner with a long experience, have curiosity to know #which goes to be, in this precise moment, in moment of the truth, the behaviour of #all *nosotros in front of a new model of organisation of the #european integration.
The dissemination of information on the scope of threats of marine pollution - hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that they take the best measures of *mitigación possible and enjoy of the complete support and confidence of the public.
Gentleman President, appreciate to the Environment Commission, and in particular to speaker, Mrs. *McKenna, #as well as to members of Budget Commission, the work made and the interest that have devoted to this proposal.
Besides, the valid international agreements on protection of the Mediterranean Sea, of the Sea *Báltico and of the Sea of the North, in the that the Community is part *contratante, follow #all *ellos approach of not mentioning substance in concrete;
*Nosotros sustain, in the matter, the request of Mrs. #Jackson of no content with approving recommendations, but to happen to stage of a true managerial, that fix some precise criteria that #all States members will have to respect in inspections.
*Cuando get moment, my Group has intention to contribute, in breast of the Assembly and in the suitable forums, to a debate that expect that it initiate on the lessons that like Parliament have to learn of audition process.
In auditions, commissioners have shown so conciliatory in front of the majority of deputies that even groups that by reasons *extraeuropeas had promised to show aggressive have buried the axe of war with rapidity.
The next *CIG is the greater challenge to the that confronts the European Union like political and economic organism from the decisions taken during negotiations of the Treaty of *Maastricht that set up the process of the Economic and Monetary Union.
*Le ask that it was very ambitious in this direction and that reach that relation among the Commission and Parliament, as *usted had occasion to manifest in a meeting with the parliamentary spokesmen, do not add zero, but that it was a positive sum.
No *cuando overlook #all the warnings and proposes to commissioners on the that the *primer report of the committee of wise persons has launched serious doubts; without embargo, after conversation, in the commission did not take any critical question to Mr. *Lamy during his oral appearance.
has talked of the political balance of the Commission, that is not condition inscribed in the Treaties, but a requirement that demands the political prudence and also consideration to this House.
*Cuando commissioners do not have #all responsibility and #all the authority on #all the administration, #all the references to a responsible administration sound to hollow, and am safe that Mr. *Kinnock, to the equal that the majority of *nosotros, accustoms to carry better out of house.
Without embargo, is #likely that with frequency seat alone in debate table of the Commission, as *usted, gentleman *Prodi, do not has the lower idea on the interests of persons that live in the European Union, although it always talks of the #european soul and the has to flower of lips.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen deputies, no *les will surprise that the #belgian delegation of the *PPE #can not give approval *unísona to commissioner school, but for the next years will keep a constructive position to work with #all commissioner school.
Mr. *Fischler expressed *verbalmente the political commitment to keep the current General Direction of Fishing, modifying the statement that had taken by writing in questionnaire and accepting, therefore, keep the current General Direction of Fishing.
Therefore *le ask to *usted that take very fine note of *ello; and also ask it to Mr. *Kinnock, that is to left, like Vice-president commissioned of reform, since it is condition *sine *qua *non for the maintenance of the parliamentary confidence that have awarded to Mr. *Fischler in our commission.
The majority of the commission also declared satisfied with the answers of Mrs. Palace to indictment of the socialists in relation with investigation of subventions to crop of linen in *España.
That the Commission take reflection -*nosotros the go to take also-, and afterwards go to try -the two institutions of the European Union- get to a preparatory document to facilitate the adoption of agreements.
In summary, gentleman *Prodi, still #can *convencerme with an active measure, but #this will have to constitute a signal very *convincente for Parliament and the public opinion or of it contrary *yo go to vote against tomorrow, to the equal that #many #others, and my negative vote will not be a "no" to *Europa, but vote in favour of #one *Europa clean, democratic and transparent.
*Ello gave a quite unreal character to exercise since it #can not, and with reason, integrate drama of *Kosovo and his financial consequences, and finally because, by reasons that no *nos seem very satisfactory, #this denied to answer to worries expressed by Parliament in matter of administrative reform.
is not especially careful that Budget Commission and the Council of the Presidency talk on the foundation of an alone place- *C, while the European Parliament has 1776 places of this type.
In the first place, as I already said in my own intervention, my opinion is that the problem on coverage of the financial needs of *Kosovo goes to be with certainty #one of the essential questions of the Autumn.
*Yo said that we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission in spite of reservations that keep in relation with Palace Mrs., #whose innocence boast but #whose conception of the political responsibility in a subject that concerns to the community budget do not share.
Want to express my satisfaction regarding urgency of fulfillment of article 13 of the Letter of fundamental rights, urgency that Minister *Halonen underlined in intervention and that *yo share, so *yo also expect that the Commission take initiatives to the *respecto.
The protection of privacy is regulated in the Statement of the Human Rights, in the International Treaty on political rights and citizens, #as well as in the European Treaty on the rights of man.
By part, treats of security and of fundamental rights, is to say, of inalienable individual rights. On the other hand, treats of the protection of security and of the protection of these individual rights by part of the public organisms, and more in particular, by part of the public organisms that they have to create in *Europa.
But *presentimos, after the speech that have heard here this morning, that #can be it, since it that in the Treaty of *Amsterdam was by strength allocated to be "dead letter" or mere music celestial, earns relief public, favourable greater consensora, imposes of course by the need, by it that goes back credible a common space of freedom, security and justice.
Besides, because it gives preference to the community method concerning cooperation *intergubernamental traditional, it that *propiciará a new juridical identity or institutional #european, more effective, modern and next to the problems that until today go rotting, without resolving, by the *empecinamiento in the *soberanismo and in the nationalist juridical-fetishism.
sentence has at least merit to show that the European Parliament and the Commission go to support mutually to increase his respective powers and *pisotear the decisions of the Council.
#If it that pretended was to take *borrón and new account, is clear that attempt has failed because with these two gentlemen is impossible to go back to begin from zero. And do not forget that the #european citizens have right to that *nosotros, deputies to the European Parliament, control that members of the Commission are persons *intachables.
To the contrary of the #european right, that has tried manifestly disguise divisions by means of the virulence of attacks, sometimes personal and *injuriosos, against Commissioners, *yo *me propose to give preference to road of the *concertación and collaboration with the future Commission.
That the #european citizens recover the illusion and confidence in the process of #european construction depends now of the Commission that, under the direction of President *Prodi, begins today career.
By reason, in morning debate it #would be necessary to decide that Reconstruction Office install in *Pristina, and that of way was attached to Control Office of Stabilisation Treaty in *Tesalónica.
(Green\/*ALE) -. (*FI) Gentleman President, want to appreciate to the Council of Ministers his firm performance in the organisation of the referendum for the independence of *Timor Oriental, among things, sending a Delegation of high level, of the that formed part #some of colleagues in representation of the European Parliament.
During long the international community has allowed that they survived the called dictatorships of development, of Indonesian to the *Chile of the *Chicago *Boys, happening by Chinese and *Corea, countries in that, in name of macroeconomy, have tolerated that market reasons prevailed on reasons of the human rights.
supply of information will facilitate a lot the contribution of Parliament to development of an external politics of the European Union more effective and more coherent, politics that #would have to have from takes already long.
Alas have not been never in *Timor oriental but *me seat very next of village of *Timor, that comes suffering since Indonesian carried out annexation in 1975 and that has lost almost the third part of the population, murdered by the #indonesian, a proportion of deaths still greater that in the #ex *Yugoslavia.
*Cuando was appointed Secretary of External Subjects, Mr. *Cook proposed an ethical external politics that, among things, contained the obligation to impose a rigorous code of behaviour in matter of controls for armament exports.
The Council backs the celebration of an extraordinary meeting of the Commission of Human Rights and the nomination of investigation delegation that was sent to the zone.
The nuclear head office that goes to build in *Marruecos is related with desalinisation of water and *desconozco #if *Marruecos has problem that *nosotros pose in our presumptive on head office that goes to install in *Turquía, is to say, the problem of the seismicity, and precisely after the terrible earthquake of takes #few days in *Turquía.
#Can indicate the Council #which are States members of the Union #whose citizens do not require visa to travel to the #EE.UU. and how management thinks to make in front of said country with the end that the suppression of the compulsory visa affect to #all citizens of the European Union?
Gentleman President, as it mentions Mr. Deputy, #some of the countries candidates to the EU have requested in adhesion negotiations transitory periods to follow limiting the free acquisition of real estates by part of citizens and companies of the European Union.
Gentleman President, agree with Mr. Deputy in that it #would be convenient to include the minimum labour norms in the list of subjects of the next " Round of #Millenium" of the *OMC, and already in the *preparativos has split of the base that it is necessary to take out to debate these subjects.
Wanted to know #if the Council is had to study #some measures of this type with seen to demolish diet literally criminal, it that *nos #would avert, as in the case of the Soviet Union, cry 30 or 40 years after the tragedy.
The Commission takes a call to #all parts so that they respect the Resolution 1244 of the Security Council, #as well as the agreements and the military initiatives in whole, and wait that the deployment of the *KFOR and the *UNMIK complete fully without great delays.
Then it is necessary to pose also another problem: #Which have been damages *ocasionados by actions and events of *Kosovo in States that, inside the context of the Union *Europa, lived vicinity in his own meat?
Insist, nevertheless, in that the Commission and Parliament share goal: improve to the maximum rapidity and efficiency of efforts of the Commission on terrain in *Kosovo for the population of the region.
Expect that the European Commission take the initiative, with the narrow cooperation of Parliament, to convert in a more active speaker in Orient Half and do not keep to the *margen and allow that they are the Americans the that take the initiative.
The report has been elaborated by Mrs. *Morgantini, on the signature by the Commission of an agreement with Organism of public dramas and aid of Nations Joined for Palestinian refugees.
disposal has governed previous contributions of the European Union in the frame of successive agreements and has deserved reiterated praises of Nation Organism Joined, because it averts erosion of value of the community contribution.
The Assembly will be conscious that, in the context of the peace process in Orient Half and of the peace agreements of *Oslo, the subject of refugees left for conversations on the definite situation.
The budgetary plans presented to the European Parliament for consideration included initially the recommendation to reduce bottoms allocated to security campaigns *vial in *Europa in 1,5 millions of pounds (1,9 millions of euros).
Gentleman President, the resolution that finishes to approve on the politics of police cooperation, judicial and circulation of persons for the preparation of the next European Council of *Tampere reveals #some changes, apparently favourable, in the position of Parliament.
Said #this, the community Institutions have to, in my opinion, ask to the competent #russian authorities explanations of employment of bottoms allocated to development of the country and for needs alimentary.
This cathartic effect *nos #would allow definitely to the European Union formulate a new approach of relations with *Turquía and develop a more positive collaboration in a spirit of authentic solidarity, and #Grecia has to show to himself\/hisself same that is had to take part in this project.
Like this as, believe that it has to take an immediate intervention, have of resources demanded by the second and *tercer *MCA and can create the concrete mechanism, #such as the speakers have requested also, for the *blindaje *antisísmico and forecast of the pertinent damages of the earthquakes.
The Council of General Subjects of this week has engaged to approve and apply what before the regulations and asks to the European Parliament - and talk by mouth of the Council - that #take in considerations.
#can not justify of way, but, *Señorías, do not situate this type of revenges to height that the ethnic cleansings and the systematic terror that have existed in the last ten years.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, fears manifested takes instant by colleague, Mr. *Zimeray, are justified by the recent conviction to death of four persons, after some student demonstrations that took place in July; the *ahorcamiento, the past year, of man of 60 years the confirms.
Consider unforgivable, that are program #millionaire of roofs with solar energy and do not have invest at all in renewable energies, so much in *Bruselas as in *Estrasburgo, neither practise here type of energetic saving: for example, the halls of dispatches find lit day and night and is not possible *apagarlos, and similar cases.
To this *respecto wanted to say that, when seeming, only by my intervention has been possible that, for example, today was opened this café, that services are Wanted to ask that during session week building #can be used in #all capacity of Monday to Friday.
*Me seem excellent these initiatives to solve the small problems but, to trial -and is the of colleagues-, do not forget that they are small problems that will solve and are in front of *algo by it that it is necessary to congratulate to the institutions, to the #french State, to architects and to workers.
is not acceptable that elaborate to haste a report during the summer holidays to answer to query of the Council and that afterwards #this not even give by *enterado of the amendments that propose and much less consider the possibility of *hacerlas #his.
*Nosotros wanted to that from moment in that it believes the Agency remain absolutely clear that administration will be rigorous, that Reconstruction Agency with headquarters in *Salónica will be closely linked to the Stability Pact, #whose general barracks will establish also in *Salónica, and that the agency of *Kosovo will establish there like operative component of #that.
And the 80% of means allocated to agriculture delivers among the 20% of the agricultural companies. *Ello means clearly that takes years that the agricultural politics European has put of part of the alimentary industry in place to bet by the small agriculturalist and the quality.
In this context, without embargo, #can not ask to producers that sacrifice by a problematic that with frequency *les sees *rendidos and won, defeated in front of the market by extraneous faults and having in front term perspective very long to go back to win confidence conquered to base of efforts and with costs of production very often *subestimados or at least no valued fully.
Wanted to without embargo demand attention of the Assembly and of the Commission on look with frequency forgotten of #all this problematic as it is the resignation of the #european managers, of health and security of consumers especially national.
To sight of #all #this, estimate that in benefit of citizens and of consumers have to exist clear directives, because exhibition levels of human being to dioxin and the *BPC -that belong to category of dioxins- are the lowest possible.
In general lines requires it following: in the first place, in the legislative field, it is necessary to examine the community legislation referred to foods, to the *piensos, to the matters prevail, to additives, to preservatives, to substances *contaminantes, like the *biocidas, to labeling.
Like this things, do not comprise how the European Commission has been able to *recortar the initial budget of help programs to the fight against AIDS, especially in it that to the third countries refers.
*Me refer, as it is obvious, to the Agreement of *Lomé, to association agreement *algo exclusive and *algo special that always have announced that it was the answer of the European Union to the ancient colonies, #as well as to other realities, but that, in definite, directs to the #african continent.
To5-0018\/1999 of Mr. *H.-*P. #Martin, in name of Industry Commission, External Trade, Investigation and Energy, on decision proposal of the Council ((*COM(99)0404 - *C5-0099\/1999 - 1999\/0166(*CNS)) relative to help attribution *macrofinanciera to the ancient Yugoslav Republic of *Macedonia;
Which means that we need a change of structural orientation and that the political recover the primacy in this field and assume responsibility to promote an economic development and socially balanced truly stable.
Without embargo, do not believe that it correspond to the Commission define internally in the national budgets how goes to establish the global budget since, as it said previously, bottoms of the that are do not have in himself\/hisself same a concrete destination of #one or nature.
Regarding the report *Langen on the that take part more in concrete and sources of renewable energy, #everyone knows the importance of energies in the reduction of pollution and in the preservation of the natural resources.
Like conclusion, will say that the vote of these two reports constitutes guarantee for the #european citizens of the will of the European Union to protect the environment reducing our energetic dependency.
#One of the that know is the conversion of the thermal energy of the ocean, that uses temperature difference among the cold waters of the depths of the tropics and the warm superficial waters.
But in terrain of saving energetic the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental #can obtain better resulted that States members of the European Union, in spite of making efforts. In look performance is #a lot of greater.
Keep some special relations with *Sudáfrica is way to support his economic development, at the same time that strengthen the potential of the country to give a positive impulse to #all the region
To boost all #this, the European Parliament has to take advantage of #all the possibilities that *le offer in the frame of the political dialogue structured agreed and offer to *Sudáfrica the maximum possible support in efforts to reach stability.
Gentleman President, before that at all it wanted to give the thanks to the speaker by his excellent report, that begins with the following sentence: "After five years of debate, doubts, evasive, queries and negotiations, has got moment to apply Trade Agreement among the European Union and *Sudáfrica".
Confirms a clear determination by part of the EU to support change process and reform in *Sudáfrica and reflects the wish by part of parts to expand his political contacts, commercial and of cooperation in benefit of *Sudáfrica and, in fact, of #all the region of the *África meridional in group.
#This have been the subjects that today have debated, amen of, as in meeting of the Commission, look infinity relative to the procedure that, without embargo, no suits to mention in front of Parliament.
#All the political and administrative realities of this world, always has found a new strength in administration; here, by the contrary, the administration has grown by stratifications and not watching to the future.
With #everything, in my opinion, have three levels: President, the specific Commissioners on the subjects and routine that has to treat in the more fast and transparent form possible -by Internet or through communications by writing- because it do not deserves a debate.
My answer is yes, of general form, without linking to #such or *cual marries, #can fund with credits of the Structural Bottoms studies of prevention of the seismic risk so much in #Grecia as in countries, with condition that the #greek Government *nos ask it.
Said foundation will pipe bottoms through hundred of organisations no governmental to fund activities in the fields of the human rights, the protection of the environment, the social assistance, etc., #among others.
#- - (GIVE) Assisted with big interest to the debate of this morning on security of foods and have thus a question for Mr. Commissioner: is the principle of caution the that now it has to subject to proof in the Commission as a result of war of hormones with the #EE.UU.?
The Official Diary of the European Communities (*DO), that precisely spreads the community legislation, have a thrown of 20.000 copies for a population of 380 millions of persons. is not of *extrañar that access to information was difficult.
Simultaneously to the possible adhesion of the Union to the anti-doping world-wide agency, are convinced that we need a #european plan, plan that involve responsibility, with the Fifteen walking to rhythm to combat the *lacra of doping.
After my long years of experience like euro-deputy, *yo neither conceive the informative politics exclusively in the field of the "high spheres" , but that believe that it also has to be directed to the youngest, to boys, that absorb like sponges information that afterwards will use along #all life.
Like Commissioner, expect that this decision contribute to development of an economic and social sector fundamental for the #european populations that live of fishing and, in general, for feeding of the #european citizens.
Expect sincerely that confidence arisen among these two countries like consequence of distention *les give the possibility to attack with spirit that the shown in the last debates the difficult relative questions to security of the region.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, deputies #french, #flemish and Italians of the coordination of #european rights are favourable to the establishment with *Turquía of relations based in the reciprocal respect, the reciprocal advantages, the no interference in the inner subjects.
The first, that relations among the European Union and *Turquía are fundamental for parts in the present and in the future, in #all the fields and to #all levels and, second, that has to be priority for the European Union boost of intelligent way democratisation of *Turquía.
#If *Turquía accepts, together with the prerogatives, also the obligations that link, without exception, to #all members that wish to annex to the European Union, and #if it fulfils consistently the criteria and the calendars that derive of the common decisions of *Copenhague and of *Luxemburgo, then will be able to reach his #european goals.
The inclusion of *Turquía in the European Union #would be an excessive charge for the European Union and #would impose to *Turquía a political change radical that #can not fulfil in a predictable term and that, as I know, neither wants to make.
Gentleman President, the passionate and exciting character of the debates celebrated the past week in *Bruselas in breast of Group, #as well as the that they are in this hemicycle, show, #if it was necessary, the importance of the question that today *nos subjects.
Is truth that sight point is of big importance, but the economic and regional collaboration, that has to be considered in the group of #all parts involved, is a paramount factor to increase confidence and ensure peace achieved.
The Presidency #finnish understands that there #be possibility to achieve deep changes in the zone and will follow working with partners by peace and by the common interest through #all means to our scope.
deputies will remember, as it has said the Presidency, that the European Union is the greater financial donor of the world-wide help to carry reconciliation to the population of Orient Next.
In view of our important contribution to help to the Palestinians that surpasses the 50% of the total, the greater part of the future meetings of coordination of donors #would have to celebrate , in our opinion, inside the Union and be *copresididas by the Been member of the European Union that exert of host of the meeting.
Gentleman President, this proposal celebrates the fine news, hit of negotiations of *Sharm The *Sheik and the agreement on security runner for products, vehicles and the #palestinian population.
In this context, receive with satisfaction the decision of the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the cancellation of disposals of the Palestinian National Letter, that asks the destruction of #Israel.
In addition to the relative questions to sovereignty and security among #Israel and the *Líbano, the return of refugees will be of special interest for the *Líbano, country in the that the ethnic balance sees affected by the presence of 250.000 refugees #palestinian in territory.
Gentleman President, in the Basque Country have examined with interest #all peace process #palestinian, because in *Euskal *Herria also support the need to surpass the current political conflict through democratic agreements.
Have said to the eleven countries candidates that candidate status to adhesion is to time adhesion promise and #if #this is like this devaluates said status when conceding it to *Turquía but saying to time that do not goes to negotiate.
To reach the goals of the Union is very important to convince to the countries in roads of development of the advantages of a wide round and of the fine intentions that there #be behind posture of the EU.
For the #european opinion also is necessary to strengthen capacity of artistic creation in the audiovisual field, key sector of culture, and the Union has to answer to this expectation.
Have the will -taking out split of dimension, of weight in the world-wide economy and of the institutional progresses that have made- of *reconquistar sovereignty that the world-wide markets sometimes *nos contest and to contribute to #one *gobernabilidad global effective?
Defend the #european model of agriculture that covers by the same food production, the conservation of the familiar agricultural exploitations, of the rural areas and the protection of the environment.
As only a European Union with capacity to negotiate, will be able to reach that it get in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Trade in the process of globalisation to a better balance among the #european model and the North American *liberalizador.
First, the Commission already has declared that it do not has objection to that in the conclusions that will approve in *Seattle include the text on paper of the European Parliament in the organisation and realisation of the new round of the *OMC.
Wanted to believe it, but *nos prevents it the bitter experience purchased, for example, with ancestor of Mr. *Lamy, *Sir *Leon *Brittan, #whose commitments in Parliament of *oponerse to the American compacter resulted punctually broken: see the case of the law *Helms-*Burton and of the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
Gentleman President, is not more that X-ray of moment. In base to X-ray, believe that it proceeds to take an only call, and is the following: How thinks the European Commission keep joined to #all these loving hedgehogs, afterwards, time that feel around the table in *Seattle?
Pretend to expand liberalisation every time to more sectors and to more countries, included agriculture and the essential services for development and the improvement of the quality of life of the populations, like education and health.
Am convinced that Parliament do not goes to ratify a Treaty in the that they do not have a position elevated the principle of prevention, the protection of consumer and the sanitary politics.
Resort to taxes like threat without *combinarlos with subventions to adapt the most ancient head offices so that they adjust to broadcast requirements acceptable and generally without increasing investment in surveillance of broadcasts no *surtirá effect.
In name of the Presidency #finnish #can say that we consider important that the Union take progresses in the establishment of a common tax to energy, even have proposed the possibility that the countries that want to, #can advance more quickly in this direction.
#Which will be the criteria of territorial cast of the relative structural Bottoms to the #spanish State and allocated legally to the Autonomous Communities of the Goal *n1 1 in the period 2000-2006?
But my question to the Council is the following: thinks the Council *presionar to States members with taxes of execution of the inferior structural Bottoms to the #european average so that they execute better bottoms and prevent that it reproduce the effect "ball of snow" ?
How thinks to take the Council to promote the approval of a *quinto plan of action, with sufficient means and a precise calendar, and how measured goes to take to fix concrete goals and *mensurables in the field of equality of opportunities among men and women?
Subject: only Method in statistics of *toxicomanía The European Observatory of Drugs and the *Toxicomanías with headquarters in *Lisboa commissions to analyse statistics on *toxicomanía pertinent of States members. *Ello allows to study development of the *toxicomanía to scale #european and compare the national statistics.
Like this as, is urgent that the #european citizens #can understand that the increase of resources assigned to the fight against drugs corresponds, literally, to an increase of drug consumption and, therefore, that politics applied are a complete failure.
How measured goes to take the Presidency to combat form of cultural purification and to consolidate paper of libraries in plough of democracy and information?
Subject: peripheral insular Regions During the Presidency #finnish, goes to define the Council politics around the peripheral insular regions of the Goals 1 and 2, in relation with infrastructure politics, agriculture and employment?
Taking into account the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, thinks the Council now take all it possible to reach the adoption of a global community program of fight against poverty and #can indicate in how measured thinks to support actions of the EU in matter of accommodation and in favour of persons without home?
Subject: Access of the public to the meetings of the Council #One of the goals of the Presidency #finnish is that the majority of the meetings of the Council are public and accessible so much to citizens as to the media.
Have, therefore, a big responsibility to impose our political weight and the commercial agreement and of cooperation to detain war and procure that dialogue restart with President *checheno and with Parliament *Checheno chosen under supervision of the *OSCE.
*B5-0169\/1999 of Gentlemen *Frassoni and *Wuori, in name of the Green Group\/*ALE, on the establishment of a universal moratorium of the execution of penalties capital by the General Assembly of Nations Joined;
Gentleman President, *me ask #if the Commission #can give support to the proposal that presented so that the EU summon a meeting with the representatives of the *OSCE with the object to argue the situation of the #gipsy with #all #that that act in the zone.
The greater part of the problems with that *nos confront will fit in place of the frame established for the organisation of support and the restoration of society in *Kosovo, or was that *me seems that it suffices with the current organisation, but anyway *les will transmit wish.
Without embargo, the Commission knows very well that the conjoint utilisation of the aerial space by diverse users, civil and military, #can be the cause of problems of security, as it already is responsible in part of congestion and delays of the aerial traffic.
#That is, of course, our position, but has been accident of the day death rale of the nuclear industry, or have to follow suffering the nuclear terror before we achieve to put final point to this monstrous industry?
Gentleman President, *cuando in the last years have talked of employment of the atomic energy for the generation of electrical energy always *nos have referred to the dangerous reactors of the East, that are of manufacture #russian.
Regarding fuel utilisation *MOX in head offices *nucleoeléctricas, the pertinent decision the adopts the company of public services that it treat, after having received the timely licence of the national authorities of security.
#If we want to conserve the general advantages, social, human and environmental of a clean atmosphere, then norms fixed by the recent managerial of the European Union on broadcasts of vehicles and the quality of fuel have to respect rigorously.
*Señorías, the report and decision proposal that present and that go to explain in brief in name of the Commission of Constitutional Subjects refers to the application of the Agreement *interinstitucional on modalities of investigations *antifraude.
#All know that this regulation gets in a very timely and important moment, a moment of demand generalised of fight against fraud, and against the circumstances that take it possible, with the last goal of his total eradication.
The proposal of Mr. *Napolitano, proposal that, as *él same has said, was approved without objection #any by the Commission of Constitutional Subjects, constitutes a clear step, a very concrete step in this direction.
A decisive question for confidence of participants in the reliability of the juridical businesses celebrated by electronic road is the question of the juridical efficiency of procedures.
In the field of the juridical harmonisation is precise to find always a difficult balance among the necessary harmonisation, by part, and respect to the existent juridical traditions in States members, by #another.
In his first reading, Parliament encouraged a lot for adding an important additional goal, that consisted in tackling the problem of the *derramamiento of diesel in roads, that comes posing an every time greater risk for users of #the same, and very particularly for the *motociclistas.
Therefore, *yo expect that, on the base of the agreements that adopt Parliament this week, the Council and the Commission consider the possibility to establish definitively the procedure of the consultative committee.
In the past #this was a rather ambiguous sphere, but is to expect that now, with the introduction of these four amendments, have cleared the situation by it that refers to #all persons that use this type of facilities.
Gentleman President, *señorías, wanted to *sumarme to it said by the two orators that *me have preceded in the use of the word to express my gratitude and also my approval by work effected by the general speaker and by Budget Commission.
*Tercer objective: a reinforcement of means in matter of fight against delinquency and, chamber, a budgetary line that allow to adopt measures in the frame of the action plan of the Commission 2000-2004 of fight against drug traffic.
#would not have to run the risk to restrict the juridical protection in the European Union, especially *cuando continuously proclaims the will to create a space of freedom, security and justice.
imagination fault that has manifested up to now the Council has to give step to a more realistic consideration, also regarding the future competitions of Parliament, included competitions in the budgetary field.
Culture has not gone out in the budgetary process so very stopped as it had wished, but things *nos go now much better that with the proposal of the Council of Ministers and our figures *acercan now to level of 1999.
*Yo wanted to direct the following observations to the Council and to the Presidency of the Council: do not takes fault that *nos remember responsibility in front of the #european taxpayer, neither that also are forced to respect the budgetary discipline.
*Yo entrust in that the statements of today do not remain in an isolated gesture and that Parliament assume also the next year responsibility to examine *críticamente in #all the commissions #if resources consigned are properly.
In the *marasmo budgetary European there #be not place for two crocodiles: for crocodile of the European Council and for crocodile of the European Parliament, the *cual, after having eaten to the Commission demolishing to *Santer, wants now eat to the Council.
Once again, the Council confused the budgetary frame *plurianual, is to say, the financial perspectives, with the own budget: myopia interested that prevented the suitable political decision and timely and that *nos forces to processing *renqueante of the budget.
Reflects of reliable form the feel of deputies socialist and of other sectors of the Assembly that here attended to offer testimony in the debate that in the past partial period of September celebrate on the situation in *Timor Oriental.
Finally, in moment in that *Lusaka *nos remembers the human and economic disasters of AIDS in *África, are bottoms that *le have assigned, *contrariamente to affirmations of Commissioner *Nielson, *mezclándolas with health politics and natality.
#If we got to helps that *equivalen to a 50% roughly of the gross national product #kosovar, and #if *nos guide by the highest forecasts, this phenomenon #can produce , *me fear that the consequences, *inflacionarias and #others, on the economy #can surpass to the advantages of helps.
In this frame, underline that budget project of the Council represents less of the 1,10% of #GDP community, value already of by himself\/hisself low and, besides, very inferior to the maximum limit of 1,27% fixed in *Edimburgo and confirmed in *Berlín, it that justifies a deep reflection by part of the one who wishes much more of the European Union.
In the first place, *permítanme mention the extensive conferences of press that vice-president and *yo same summon immediately after the first meeting of Government Council month, #whose transcriptions, included the of question sessions and answers, are also available in page *web of #ECB.
function of our internal forecasts inside the strategy of monetary politics of the *SEBC differs, therefore, of function of inflation forecasts in a strategy directed directly to inflation.
To send a clear signal to the banking sector and to citizens, #ECB published in September a series of goals that expects fulfil the sector and that they had to contribute to some substantial improvements.
In actuality, do not seems justified an operative intervention of #ECB, since already there are indications that it is the general recognition of the problem by part of the private sector.
do not want to say with #this that it was indispensable the publication of the literal records, but #would be important that #can have of records *resumidas with the arguments -in favour and against-, that allow to appreciate reasoning that follows in practice the Central Bank European to determine inflation risk or of deflation.
To the Central Bank European *le will result much more difficult to adopt uncomfortable decisions, as for example not dropping interest types, but *aumentarlos, *cuando the economic situation go back more difficult and stability of prices see really loomed.
In his first months of existence, the Central Bank European has won confidence, but so that it #can keep firm in decisions more advance, in circumstances like the described, is necessary that follow consolidating systematically said confidence in the next years, and have *usted security, gentleman President, that it will put to explain for *ello with support of my Group.
Nevertheless, applaud the goals and coherence of the Report *Huhne like base to define the democratic responsibility of the Central Bank, on the that it wanted to say #some words, in particular on the subject of transparency and the democratic responsibility.
The third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union puts on the *tapete, of way stronger that in the past, the need of a more robust coordination and more articulated of the economic politics.
The editorial of the resolution #can be interpreted as #if it suggested that *cuando inflation tax situate underneath of the 2% then the system of the Euro #would be under the obligation to support the economic politics generals of the Communities.
Gentleman President, go to take three questions in name of my socialist mates of Development Commission, that are here present in spirit but that physically are in the own commission, voting the relative amendments to the World-wide Organisation of Trade.
Agree in that members of parliament are of course important elements, although #if we take countries like *Somalia, *Sudán and other similar places, are forced to accept the structures of the existent civil society and treat to help to that these structures convert in components of society civilised.
In this moment, and from this hemicycle of the new facilities of the European Parliament, my country has the privilege of *hablarle to *Europa, in head of the representatives chosen commonly by the fifteen countries that at present conform the European Union.
The international community is *clarividente and *nos watches with attention; *nosotros, from our own clairvoyance, observe equally it that occurs in the field of nations and know that it is precise to act now, that there #be not time to lose; know that it is moment of cooperation, no of confrontation neither neither of intervention.
Is suitable to award to the greater governmental authorities powers *transfronterizos to pursue to criminals, although the use of powers will have to be supervised by the European Parliament and the #european courts, of face to consolidate and defend vigorously the civil rights.
Finally, #if well the Council has announced the increase of competitions and of the mandate of *Europol, necessary instrument to struggle against delinquency organised, how say of the democratic control and *jurisdiccional, in particular regarding file constitution?
The extraordinary meeting of the Council of *Tampere presented even more difficult to confront because justice and interior subjects took for the first time to be treated in diary of the European Union.
abnegation and work in terrain has allowed to re-create a social mesh and has taken to retreat in the daily life racism, hate and contempt.
Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, when closing orator list of Parliament *me seems that there #be thing that *me comes to mind: *ustedes have talked of the spirit of *Tampere and *yo believe that there #be besides a signal of *Tampere.
is not *superfluo expect that, at the end of the year 2000, #can take out in the new Treated the institutional consequences of the decisions that #can adopt of here to then, with Colony spirit, for security and defence of the #european continent.
The first reform will appease fears of citizens that they produce increasingly transfers of sovereignty, and the *segunda #would have to encourage to citizens to take part of a more evident mood to hour to choose among the political options that *nos present in *Bruselas and *Estrasburgo.
#Some of *ellas the consider perfectly viable, for example, those directed to simplify the Treaties or the proposal that in the future the general norm has to be the qualified majority decisions in the Council and the *codecisión of Parliament.
method: Colony Council, the past month of June, denied to appoint work group restricted to prepare review work of the Treaty.
Consider that it more indicated had been can vote this amendment because, especially in a so delicate matter like security *vial, is to say, the protection of life of citizens, #would have been able to be very useful.
With the adoption of this amendment open the door to the resumption of discussion with the Council on the future statute of deputies to the European Parliament, with hope that said statute adopt what before.
The Governments of the EU have agreed to create a common space of justice to combat the common problem of crime organised, especially drug trafficking and the traffic of human beings.

Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, want to begin my intervention, like representative of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, in the debate on restructuring of companies with the message of employees of *Michelin, that, to my understand, comports three *noes, although it dislike to my colleague Mr. *Pronk.
In the first place, a direct links among the public helps and agreements that collect a reduction of the labour day with financial sanctions for companies that do not respect commitments, *cuando have received public bottoms.
Gentleman President, *yo celebrate that this debate develop today here because Parliament has to be permanently attack to the needs of citizens and be avant-garde in the #european construction; and, to fulfil this double goal, development of the social dimension of *Europa *me seems fundamental.
Already there are proposals of the European Parliament on the two directives to the that have referred, the directive on the commission of the #european company and the directive on the collective dismissals.
Forbids type of nuclear essays in place, also the nuclear explosions peaceful calls, the *cuales were object of a warmed up theoretical discussion in the birth of the Treaty of no proliferation of nuclear arms in the years 60.
The wonderful newspaper *International *Herald *Tribune publishes today a summary of intervention that made takes days in the Council of External Relations adviser of President for the national security, *Sandy *Berger.
This proposal that, casually, has obtained support of the European Parliament and of my country, *Irlanda, presents a new mood of thinking on how adopt effective measures that defend the cause of a world without nuclear arms.

Here have to act the different speakers to the most diverse levels and *me cheers that the Commission have made a really fine proposal to #mine suggestion, consistent in planting a clearly visible Link in his *Homepage.
Allow to *Turquía take part in programs "#Socrates" and "Youth" , in consequence, do not involves to award legitimacy to State that still has not given concrete samples of maturity regarding respect of the rights of minorities, but contributes to help to youngsters to stress his slow and difficult process.
The question is #if #this has to be treated here, or was after discussion in the Commission of Budgetary Control, or #if it has to debate thoroughly in discussion on reform of the Commission in whole in #all the notable commissions.
After discussion in Budget Commission and with the group of the competent commissions for opinion, have reached some as a whole satisfactory proposals for #all, but to coast to brush the limit of the *margen.
do not have the necessary majority to accept the inclusion of a reference to the annex in the own Internal Regulation, but still have to decide #if we want to add to Regulation the agreement *interinstitucional in himself\/hisself.
Regarding point 11 of the report of *Virrankoski, believe that Parliament, by part, already engaged the past spring to renew Regulation so that diets by trips will be rewarded in function of the real costs.
The Council introduces quantities allocated to the development of initiatives for the deepening of the Union *Aduanera EU-*Turquía and for the social and economic development of *Turquía, without posing the known political conditions, so that they approve later, and without *vincularlas to actions related with the earthquakes.

Gentleman President, so only some brief notes -since in name of my Group will take part to continuation colleague #Salvador *Jové *Peres- to say that #this is a subject that earns particular importance and a big actuality so much by it that means regarding fish supply as by the number of places of direct and indirect work affected.
The agreement has to, as, look for inside respect of the common identities, of sovereignties and of respect of it that we are, #one and #others, recognising that history has taken of *Marruecos #if no a cultural exception, at least a #mediterranean exception for *Europa, in general, and for *Francia, in particular.
To this *respecto, #would suit to take into account three factors: first, fruits and vegetables cultivate in the European Union in zones #where also employment is a need *acuciante; second, fruits and vegetables use frequently like coin of change in the commercial agreements with third countries and, third, in the last reform of this sector dismantled important public instruments of management of markets.
The problem of *Marruecos is essentially with *España, #everyone knows it, fleet #spanish is #a lot of greater, Spaniards fish in competition with the Moroccans; fleet #portuguese is smaller, by it that fishing do not competes with the of the Moroccans.
And, in name of subsidiariness principle, *eso is it that ask with seen to reflection on the review of Politics *Pesquera Common: a country member of Politics *Pesquera Common has to can *concertar bilateral agreements with third countries, always that no have agreements among the European Union and #that third countries.
The sector explains roughly with 40.000 workers and, therefore same, an international agreement like the agreement with *Marruecos exerts a fundamental paper in supply of consumers and transformation industries with products *pesqueros to reasonable prices.
Finally, note about paper of Parliament that will have to see to deputies like observers associated to #all negotiation procedures, so as to watch by the interests of fishing fleet #european.
Is to say, the elimination of the called material of risk do not contributes an absolute security, although it do not leave to be security measure, since the open animals in channel are susceptible to transmit infection.
Have got finally of condition period very demanding established by the European Union for industry of the bovine, conditions that fulfilled, and therefore the Commission has to apply *decididamente the lifting of the prohibition to exports of bovine.
Along the debate President of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, put of self-evident that bear *él security alimentary constitutes #one of the goals *prioritarios, and the Commission wants to and has to open a new page in politics of consumers.
A specific debate of Parliament that carried to the formulation of a political trial on the behaviour of the one who was, #would be absurd and especially no #would favour the good global operation of the #european Institutions.
Gentleman President, have enjoyed for real with #some of interventions of today, in particular with the initial speech of Mr. *Donnelly, that seemed to be criticism of the inability, by part of the #french Governments and British, to give #any solution to this commercial war that goes in increase.
#Such as it has announced it Commissioner *Fischler, the Commission will send to his *Señorías the pertinent documents this afternoon, before press conference, to *través of the electronic post, and also will be able to consult in intranet of Parliament.
*Le have been allocated 10,3 millions of euros, that definitely is a considerable amount, and not even have the guarantee to be able to have of sufficient resources in case that *Angola decree a biological stop for shrimp capture.
(*Verts\/*ALE). (*FR) Lady Speaker, the truth is that it is not order question, but is true that events *suceden and *me saw forced to adopt a decision Friday, *cuando no longer had nobody to answer to my questions.
#""the Committee considers that measures adopted by Realm Joined take that the risk for the human health of export plan with calendar established result at least comparable with the existent in States #european members".
Is or is not true, gentleman Commissioner, that takes month presented to the Commission of Agriculture of the European Parliament directive project in the that it said that before the 2003 #can not indicate the origin of the bovine in label?
For the first time, find around table, to level of the Union, #all agents: the Council, the Commission, the Central Bank European and the representatives of speakers of work market.
#This reflects clearly that the Central Bank, by part, is had to take part in an open and direct dialogue, #as well as to argue sight points and performance methods.
In *tercer place, *me #would enjoy to stand out that discussion showed clearly utility of this type of direct exchange, that allows to each #one of participants express, of direct form, sight points and receive the timely answers by part of the remaining participants.
The 500 millions of euros supplementary #whose unblock asks to the European Bank with the pretext to boost the creation of places of work and the one thousand millions for technology #SME advanced will go allocated officially to investment.
In society with division of work very accused is indispensable coordination of activities of the economic agents, well to *través of the market, well through the political planning.
How *sucederá in the future *cuando have a problem in our economy and have a grave shaken external or intern and it was necessary to talk with the social speakers and the other economic agents on #some measures maybe unpleasant that have to adopt in the #european level?
treats of element of a global plan of proposals presented by the Commission the past month of November to try satisfy lagoons of the sectors that remained excluded of the original directive on the labour day in 1993.
difficulties that now confront in Transport Council with the legislative proposal that the Commission presented owe directly to that they did not reach advances on the labour day in the sector of transport by road.
The length of work time forms part, by it other, of security and health in place of work, #as well as of competition conditions; looks, competitions of the European Union.
Gentleman President, beyond all doubt, adapt the length of work time of workers of ships with flag of third countries that use community ports to the length of the of ships community, is a positive measure.
Have, by part of the capital shipowner, an intensification of work and of exploitation of workers in the sea, with the corresponding *agudización of the problems related with health and security in the sea.
Believe that, #if well #all the that form part of this Assembly #would receive with *beneplácito the opportunity to guarantee work environment safer, no only for employees, but also for consumers and users of transport and other, have to watch by no *reglamentar excessively in sector determined.
#One of looks that more *les concern is that, as in *Irlanda -and also in Big *Bretaña, for example- exists an archaic system and of feudal type by the that the auxiliary doctors in period of training are apprentices -employ this word in wide sense- of the upper specialists, have fear to pose *demasiadas worries, because *eso #can affect to his future careers.
ratification of the instruments of the *OIT is, sure enough, a necessary condition to proceed to inspections on board of foreign ships that take scale in ports of States members, which *nos will allow, among things, avert disloyal competitions inside our own ports precisely.
In this frame, #can not by less of *sumarme to the conclusions of the Commission of External Subjects, Human Rights, Common Security and Political of Defence, because *eso allows a greater freedom of expression for those who work in the scientific and technological sphere in Chinese and in general.
Of mood, wish that the scientific and technological cooperation undertaken cover practical projects of cooperation directed to timely goals and that improve the execution and productivity of projects funded, #among others, by program of *cooperacion in matter of investigation, by program *TACIS and by program *INTERREG.
In actions undertaken up to now, already had taken upsetting in the formulation of projects of collaboration with countries of *Mercosur, association in the that Argentinian exerts an important paper, by it that constitutes like bridge head for *nosotros concerning countries of *América Latin.
In our opinion, *ello is due to the fact that the systems of technological development that employ in industry of car hamper global improvements of product owing to the high specialisation of laboratories of *I + *D of companies.
Have to recognise that, although I no longer am member of parliament of the all *inexperta, the multiplicity of sections in the that is *subdividida: strategic goal, operative goal, goals that expects to achieve, concrete measures of legislative character and no legislative, in reality no *me has facilitated understanding of the text and of it that wishes *comunicarnos the Commission.
In this moment have a wide community regulation in fifteen States members, fifteen national regulations different and, in cases, for example in States federal or almost federal, #a lot of greater.
Before happening to the last point of my speech wanted to *referirme to observation of Mr. *Berenguer *Fust. deputy has signalled that defence of consumer #can not go in detriment of the inner market.
Have tried -and expect that in measure have achieved it- create this balance to avert that defence of the interests of consumer and the protection of consumer go in detriment of the inner market.
Without embargo, the #european strategy for employment, #such as it has elaborated, goes putting in practice little by little from the summit of *Luxemburgo and characterises by some debatable ideological foundations and by a little dynamic conception of the institutional procedures.
Thus *nos seems indispensable to evaluate hit or the failure of the #european strategy for employment with help of indicators that measure simultaneously number of unemployed inscribed and the levels of life and the quality of work places created.
Had account that to scale #european politics in matter of employment are political of suggestion, of indication, of impulse of coordination among States members - therefore, no exists a true effective power and *decisorio, which, after all, supposes *algo positive in name of subsidiariness principle, but a quite limited power - believe that Parliament #would have to be involved fully.
do not go back to open now the debate of the day: the answer is the answer that have *resumido, that remembers the terms of investigation that proposed and that #all accepted, and that it was made by the General Secretary and that has given this result.
In the first place, estimate that intervention, the common intervention of the community Institutions of States members, in look of offer politics to increase employment, is important but no sufficient.
In definite, because we follow thinking in bottom that the market goes to resolve a problem that is not a problem that #can be resolved by the market because it is not a circumstantial problem, is a problem of model of society.
The main obstacle to the creation of employment of quality and with rights is the existence of a Stability Pact with criteria of nominal convergence that impose limitations to the public investments and condition the economic and social politics.
has accepted my amendment to keep an annual rhythm for the review of the guidelines so that States members no wane in the active promotion of employment.
Also consider *algo problematic the fact that the proposals for the guidelines of the year 2000 begin to treat before they have carried out entirely, or not even have set up, the concrete measures of the previous guidelines.
Have of sufficient time to be able to treat also this so important report for the future of the European Union already speakers have taken creditors that report was treated in a suitable time?
Believe that #this do not has felt from sight point of the national economy *cuando knows that nitrogen oxides and particle broadcast belong necessarily to curve and *cuando modifies #one of the two toxic elements follow automatically consequences for the #another.
proof cycles for the register of values of broadcast of vehicles will have to be, logically, in the most brief term possible, a representative reflection of the real state of circulation.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that is today for debate on gas broadcasts in the commercial vehicles weighed prolongs, in my opinion, our continued efforts in *pro of the improvement of the quality of the air in *Europa keeping mobility of citizens.
Have lost the moral or religious limits, and indignation capacity no awake as it was not in front of facts so visible like the #blue illness on face, or take publics through the media.
actions of program *DAPHNE have to explain also with support of the *ONG, as *nosotros same propose in amendments, with the of the social communication, because women, that explain among the #european citizens more reluctant in relation with the European Union, have to know and comprise that programs like *DAPHNE exist and refer directly to *ellas.
And especially, how measured has intention to adopt to facilitate a political agreement to the *respecto, an agreement that is fundamental so that the Commission, the Council and Parliament take a definite decision in this matter?
Gentleman President, *me #would enjoy *unirme to complaint in front of the fact that it still have not presented by part of the Commission a review of the relative proposal to information and query of workers.
In this context, has to put especially in the pillory politics of the Council since in the international Conferences of the countries taxpayers makes continuously costs to charge of the #european budget without concern also of the corresponding income.
Already exist wide zones of consensus on the *cuales #can contribute to the improvement of finance of the Union, but the result in the vote of Budget Commission shows that they exist some concepts on the *cuales consensus is far to produce .
In #this it is necessary to study of special way the granting of the contributions, #as well as the possibility to create a new system of own resources linked directly to citizens without that *ello suppose an increase of the fiscal pressure.
#This means that tasks like enlargement of the Union, respect of the human rights all over the world and the creation of some general conditions to surpass the grave unemployment #can not make already with this frame.
The 11 March vote especially in our resolution, section that said: "Thinks that income system has to be fundamentally free of exceptions and special rules,", etc., etc. Know well it that the Council in *Berlín took of this resolution and on how based the Council agreement of *Berlín.
But before demanding more autonomy, have to take advantage of #all saving potentials in the budget of the EU and explain also to citizens of the Union reason *nos allow costs for two Parliaments and do not find systems simpler that *desgraven to citizens of the Union and no the tax even more.
Gentleman President, consider necessary reform of the system of own resources with seen to a strengthening of the principles of transparency, equity, solidarity and cohesion, with extension to the sphere of the community income.
But also say with clarity that, in *contrapartida, expect of States members that increase of the corresponding mood measures for control of the own resources and that do not look for more excuses, is to say, that control measures apply really.
Also believe that the Commission has been more hit when averting the reference to the nuclear energy in proposals and wanted to *aconsejarle that *atenga to approach, because it is the proposal that more #can cause divisions and, of course, *nosotros #would not agree with *ella.
An important part of this strategy is fixation of dip *jurídicamente *vinculantes for the renewable energies, but also is very clear that it has to have #one *externalización of the internal costs in relation with the traditional energetic production.
pressure of the market also affects to broadcasts of the public services: resistance foci more effective to a free competition *desenfrenada, the public companies are loomed.
Finally, the speaker surprises, with reason, that the Commission leave totally sideways the nuclear energy *cuando #this contributes to reduce CO2 broadcasts, even #if energy has to be safer and more respectful of the environment.
In conclusion, believe that it #can learn a lot of an exchange of opinions among States members in matter of energetic politics and support the call of Mr. *Chichester so that the Commission put of relief examples of optimum methods of integration of the environmental goals in the energetic politics.
The proportion of sources of renewable energy in the European Union will increase inside ten years until a 62 percent. In fact, results decisive plant development combined for the common production of electricity and heat that use coal and gas like fuel.
Expect thus that the Commission, *cuando present a new proposal, read his own communication on the *potenciación of the presence of the environment in the community energetic politics and contribute actively to consolidate the employment of sources of renewable energy.
First of all, the of security of supplies and the energetic dependency of the European Union, dependency that goes to increase and that runs the risk -*nos says- to reach the 70% in the year 2020, with #all the political risks that of *ello derive.
The European Union has fixed like goal increase part of these last of the 6 to the 12% for the year 2010, but is precise to find the financial means and, today day, is far to reach it, to judge by the last discussions in the conciliation commission.
Undoubtedly, *Señorías, east is a debate to the that it is necessary *dedicarle #all attention, and expect that, along the next months and, of course, before it finish the mandate of this Commission, #can develop it with *plenitud, with transparency, with intensity and with quality in discussions, as it has been the case of discussion of this report.
husband -Dr. #Rhys *Jenkins, at present general doctor and that has a labour day limited- worked in the past more of 100 hours to the week in training period for be doctor.
With regard to this last subject, the initial proposal of the European Commission proposed that doctors in period of training went in in the field of application of the Directive by means of a transitory period of seven years.
In this way will take possible the creation of a juridical space European that transmit at last to the #european citizens in #all the EU a common feeling of juridical security and guarantee a unitary civil state in #all *Europa.
Up to now have arisen problems in marriages *binacionales in the European Union by the fact that documents that certify the civil state when contracting marriage have not been recognised of mood by #all States members.
Is hit to entrust to the Court of Justice the task to define the notion of parental responsibility, *cuando regulation proposal foresaw that it took reference to the internal right of the Been member interested?
So that it was not a vain word, circulation of persons in the European Union has to go accompanied of the necessary measures in the sphere of family right.
Now that the application of the directive on nitrates poses when seeming problems in *tantos States members, is had the Commission to proceed to a new *concertación on improvement and progressive application with seen to reach norm requested for nitrates?
Gentleman *Dell' #Alba, signalled that four countries, of the twelve countries interested in the Goal 2, had been object of a first decision of principle of the Commission, of the eight countries that remain, the situation of the Federal Republic of *Alemania almost is finalised in discussions that have had.
From 1997 the Commission has the committed of the execution of action *DAPHNE, allocated specifically to the fight against violence that suffer women, teenagers and boys, to the that *sucederá program (today same approved) *DAPHNE - 2000-2003, that has goal.
The Commission expects the opinions of Parliament and of States members to elaborate action proposals back with seen to the achievement of the goals of the communication to the that finish of *referirme.
At the end of this year, no only will be able to evaluate advances of the national legislation to protect to the victims of violent offences, but also the concrete measures that each #one of States members are had to apply.
In effect, the Commission has loaned, from takes varied years, a special attention to development of the provinces of the north of *Marruecos, with occasion of the execution of the technical and financial cooperation with Realm of *Marruecos.
#If I achieve backrest by part of the Commission, it that pretends is to promote group of high level #where #would take part the main civil managers, and even #would have also that have soldiers, to help to the Commission to develop the suitable orientations.
As it will know the Assembly, the High Representative enjoys of a high and very deserved international reputation for having defended values that inscribe among it better of the #european history of this century and #whose lack has been also the *causante of it worse of history.
The at the same time Minister of External Subjects and Boss of Defence of the European Union, Mr. #Solana, said well to the clear that the meeting of Monday in *Bruselas was decision so that the EU -as it said representative- occupy in the world-wide scene place that *le corresponds.
keeps attitude twisted and liar on the situation of *Kosovo in the political context and of the international Right and first of all action shows how the small countries have seen stuck to car of allies.
And, in this sense, *me #would enjoy to know #which is the opinion that *le deserve relations among the European and Chinese Union, especially to the light of the commercial agreement recently concluded among States Joined and country.
Colony decisions do not owe *conducirnos to that day *nos find in situation that Swiss, my *segunda homeland, #where after studying the threats of the year 2000 got to the conclusion that they were very prepared to face up to dangers that no longer existed.
The *CPN exists still, but the problem was and follow being that there #be not neither in the Commission neither in the Council structure able to take advantage of of effective way experiences and knowledges of the *CPN and of organisms.
*Nos have endowed, after Colony Summit, of new instruments -#one has to see with the common strategies- that have to mean, without doubt, change in depth in mood to focus the external politics.
*Les #can say that, by part of the European Union, morning and the day after tomorrow will take all it possible so that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in *Europa exert an important paper, to the height of obligations, in moment in the that it goes to sign a new Letter of Security in *Europa.
Like this, for example, the fundamental labour norms and the social clauses #would have to contemplate in the frame of a forum of mixed work *OIT\/*OMC, and #this #would have to incorporate and take in consideration in the debates, without modifying nevertheless rule of the *OMC.
In *tercer place, that respect denominations of origin of the traditional community products, so that we do not see more this authentic piracy that practises with impunity with the community marks, as, by it other, *sucede at present in *Sudáfrica with Port wine, sherry, the *uzo or the *grappa.
Development Commission wants rules of the *OMC that do not hamper labeling plans ecological neither the shopping of biological products by part of the public.
The excellent report of *Konrad *Schwaiger -#worthy of consensus and of a majority support- leaves clear that it that *dirime is *algo more that the commercial politics, it that is in game is the participation in foot of equality of #all the countries, the social progress and respect of the human rights.
#This has to include, like minimum, the automatic parliamentary right to subject to approval any agreement of the *OMC, #as well as an a lot greater access to summaries of negotiations in breast of the Council.
To time, the Group *ELDR has resisted to #all the attempts to overload the present report with a list of the purchase of specific requests of the sectors.
Need a free access of tariffs for the less developed countries, no only for practically #all products - is sentence that leaves opened a giant lagoon so that the EU follow protecting his own agriculture - but for #all products of said countries.
Boosted by this recent precedent and #waiting for a true balance of the cycle precedent, *nos seemed urgent to expect before *lanzarnos to body discovered to negotiation #whose advantages are entirely without testing and #whose rules of the game, with evidence, do not seem #the same for the European Union and for our main partner and competitor, States Joined.
Report (To5-0052\/1999) of Mrs. *Haug, in name of Budget Commission, on decision proposal of the Council (*COM(1999) 333 - *C5-0092\/1999 - 1999\/0139(*CNS)) relative to the system of own resources of the European Union
In *tercer place, wanted to that the Table *me cleared #if reason by the that goes to proceed to the vote of the amendment *nº 31 before the amendment *nº 9 roots in section 2 of article 130 of Regulation, or was, that amendment moves away more of the original.
Had been better to find a solution under form of a mechanism of generic correction, for example, by means of the introduction of band for the national contributions to the EU.

In conception, respect by the fundamental rights of workers has like reason to be distribution more *equitativa of growth benefits that contributes liberalisation of exchanges.
*Yo *le answered it same that go to say today here, that this is not moment of the solutions neither of the proposals, but moment to see of how goes to occupy the Conference *Intergubernamental and #which is method that goes to follow in works.
Results *inquietante, alarming even, it that is in the field of the external political call and of security, vehemence with that leaves sideways the up to now civil character of the #european integration and pretends to create a military Union.
In the first place, is indispensable that reform that wishes was democratic and *democratizadora, is to say, that subordinate the *burócratas to the representatives chosen and #this to his national public opinions and that strengthen his democratic legitimacy by means of the participation of the national parliaments and do not remain *substituida by associations of doubtful representativeness or of expert suppositions.
By reason, the left #nordic will vote against of the greater part of resolution proposal that, among things, involves more shots *supranacionales, that limits the influence in the diverse treaties and that increases domination of the great states.
Believe that we #would have to learn the lesson of error of the past and recognise that the importance of enlargement in particular, the reunification of the #european family, is *algo that societies of our corresponding countries have to know during the celebration of the *CIG.
This report tries to continue development of the Union like an Alliance of States centralised, and do not takes in account at all of how mood will influence enlargement so intense in the institutional development of the Union.
As in this case *nos move in the constitutional sphere and like the Treaty follows being the upper norm of our internal rights, in the future it will be necessary to attach to a greater juridical precision.
Is important that #can have approach integrated that it tackle #all looks of reform, from the substantial questions related with the decision by majority until reform of the institutions and the treatment of essential subjects.
Are in front of a substantial modification of the national sovereignty all over the world since freedom of action of the countries is limited, so much to out as to inside, and capacity to elaborate political and solve problems sees restricted by the international relations and the *interdependencias and transnational interactions.

*Nosotros, citizens and deputies of the European Parliament, are extremely concerned because we do not see concrete signals that the Commission go to present a proposal of nature during the Presidency #finnish, since *nosotros of fine wins had begun processing.
#Which is the opinion of the Council on federalism in that the different States members renounce to the right of veto and to the criteria of qualified majority to facilitate the adoption *supranacional of decisions?
enlargement of the frame of decisions that are adopted by qualified majority in breast of the Council is #one of the subjects that will be debated by the representatives of the Governments in the Conference *Intergubernamental, that will summon at the beginning of the year 2000.
My parliamentary commission has encouraged a lot for preparing the answer of Parliament to the proposal to time to fulfil term fixed by the Council and to time so that the Council #can *examinarla on 2 December.
Therefore, gentleman President, believe that with the amendments that have introduced in the Commission of Constitutional Subjects fulfil the goal to accommodate a decision of the three institutions to the own characteristics of the #ours.
Gentleman *Prodi, Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, will expose sight point of the Greens and the European Free Alliance on *Eurodac. Have to admit that after the introduction of the speaker *Pirker nuances introduced by the previous orators have been of my like.
So that any unilateral solution, or solution of administrative character that did not contemplate in #all dimensions the authentic problem of public health and the medical looks of the subject #would constitute a *craso error.
*Nosotros are adherents no only of the total transparency with regard to the operation of #all the #european institutions, but also to the election and to the *revocabilidad, in any moment, so much of #all #that that today are deputies, as of #all those that possess responsibility, independently of the hierarchical level that it treat, including the Commission of *Bruselas.
Besides, had account of the course *desfavorable reserved to the amendments that have presented with my colleagues of the socialist delegation #french and the Groups *GUE\/*NGL and Green\/*ALE, *me have abstained, lady Speaker, in the vote of the report of Mr. *Schwaiger.
This absence of balance #can analyse like a will to hide, according to assessment of villages of the countries *adherentes to the *OMC, evidence of the effects of the *desreglamentación of the world-wide trade.
This dimension of a just trade based in the absence of a *dumping qualitative, environmental, social and fiscal, #if well it mentions in plane of the principles, is not confirmed, with #all consequences, like a goal *prioritario of the #european negotiators.
*Yo have billed the principles for *ello in a dissident opinion, *aneja to the Report *Dimitrakopoulos-*Leinen, and the Group *Europa of Nations has developed consequences presenting *veintiuna amendments, that have been refused, alas, by the majority of Parliament.
conviction consists in that the future belongs to a *Europa without borders among villages unified of extreme to #another of the continent and released of the can in fact of the industrial and financial groups, indispensable condition for a real control of villages regarding institutions.
#- - (OF) In the frame of reform of the main institutional fields of the Treaties the proposals contained in the Report *Dimitrakopoulos-*Leinen plead by enlargement of the decision by qualified majority in the Council.

repatriation of persons displaced is in course: before yesterday, of the total of persons displaced, around 65.000 had returned, and the #indonesian Government *nos has ensured that the process of voluntary repatriation will finalise inside 100 days.
Therefore I understand, gentleman President, that *nosotros, like European Parliament, have to manifest, in occasion and in #all #that in the that produce fact alike, a firm and indeclinable commitment with the right to life, as we take it in the text of this common resolution.

*Ello means that countries like *Francia and *Alemania owe *redoblar efforts in the field of treatment of the *toxicómanos whereas a country like the Low Countries, for example, has to put more obstinacy in the fight against the excessive presence of drugs by cause of the "*coffeeshops" and against tourism of drug.

reason exhibition and the explanation that today *nos has given the speaker are clear and establish the long path that Canarian has followed in *Europa to get to incorporation process to the European Union.
In case necessary, the Commission will present a proposal to the Council based in Article 299 (2) on the necessary measures not to engage the existence of some local activities particularly fragile.
From three years ago, more specifically, have expressed in varied occasions to the Commission worry by distortions of competition to world-wide level, aggravated by the fact that *Europa has imposed always an unknown rigour for opponents.
Up to now, in spite of the varied calls made in this sense because the subject is not new, the European Union and the Commission have not taken at all effective to put end to this indirect subvention in *Corea.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, industry of the construction and the naval repair of the European Union confronts grave problems, as it already has said here, it that shows that the formulas applied takes some years no are the results promised.
To the contrary of it that said the European Council in 1998, *cuando *reglamentó the new relative norms to helps to the naval construction, at the end did not improve conditions of international competition.
The reality is the that it is and, regretting it a lot, gentleman Commissioner, #if they do not adopt urgent and forceful measures, this sector, like other industrial sectors of the European Union, goes to go to the derive, for keeping the owed composure in way to talk.
*Yo wanted to also *sumarme to conviction that is here, in this #european forum, with regard to split of the truce by part of the organisation ETA, and want to express my total rejection to utilisation of violence to achieve political goals.
Of course, is very positive can listen now a big number of opinions on this important problem, but also #can observe that colleagues begin to manifest likewise wish to take part and, therefore, *yo believe that we #would have to begin to work usually in the frame of the agenda. The Commission is present.
Commissioner commissioned of education and youth will put programs *Socrates, #Leonardo and Youth to disposal of training, of collaboration among youngsters, so that the anti-doping fight was *algo wished by youths of *Europa.
Are yielding activities and, considered from sight point, believe that the Commission #can at least try regulate a bit the sector and work conditions, since, as it has said very *atinadamente Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit, #if sportsmen dope is because competitions demand it.
As *usted finishes to say, sport occupies an important place in the #european daily life and, therefore, has to occupy it also in the European Parliament, as it said President *Prodi in his inaugural speech.
First of all exist subjects specifically mentioned in *Amsterdam, #this is, the future of Commissioners, representation of States members in the Council and the extension of the vote by qualified majority.
*Yo wanted to remember likewise the importance that the Presidency summon a new #european Conference that *insufle new life to this forum and that the countries that in the future will be members of the EU take part from this time on in remodeling of the European Union.
The Conference *Intergubernamental, the *concretización of the external politics and of common security and the realisation controlled of enlargement are subjects that require a preparation in depth, so much by part of the aspiring countries to adhesion, as by part of the European Union.
And worry is still greater *cuando to defend the review that wants to take, is to say, the of the famous institutional triangle, resorts to the argument of efficiency and no to the global vision of the #european project.
With regard to the widest subject relative to the realisation of the inner market, *permítame say also that during the Presidency #finnish have received #some strategic documents very important, and the Community #would owe really *darles #a lot of more priority of the that *les gives in these moments.
The contribution of this report for the future is that no only occupies of political decisions, but that also of paper of society in the creation of a climate in the that the human rights have permanent and deep rooting popular.
Since the European Council confirmed in December of 1997 that *Turquía #can opt to the entrance in the EU, has come working in creating conditions to loan financial help of face to promote the economic collaboration and *acercar to *Turquía to the EU.
Although it had *algún shy attempt by part of Government #turkish, the recent sentence to death pity dictated against the leader *kurdo *Ocalan has moved away all possible political approach of *Turquía to the European Union.
Also want to manifest, nevertheless, my special gratitude to the #greek Government and to Subject Minister External *Papandreu, that have stepped brave, also from sight point of the political situation intern.
Believe that the European Parliament has to keep posture; have to *propiciar that *ingrese in the European Union no only *Turquía, has to *ingresar also village #turkish in the European Union, and have to take part so that in this path village access to the rights that it is deprived.
The electrical head offices, incineration facilities of waste, cement ovens and cars offer possibilities to hour to reduce monoxide broadcasts of carbon.
The subject goes much more there of the *benceno and carbon monoxide and, therefore, has to be analysed in a wider frame and from a technical perspective; the Directive 96\/62 defines the environmental air only like the "air acclimatise" .
And also want that it analyse, in the report that the Commission has to present to the Council and to the European Parliament, #if the reduction that #can have to broadcasts of CO2 has to to the technical measures of the industrial or to habits of consumers.
Therefore, allow that we complete the directive these three points, so that we #can have of a truly effective instrument to control fulfillment of the voluntary commitment, that in fact is experiment for the European Union.
Gentleman President, has checked that substance index organic harmful in seaboard and in high sea of the Gulf of *Finlandia increases, in general, eastwards, which reflects the influence of the poured *contaminantes pertinent of *Rusia in the index of harmful substances in the *Báltico.
But there #be a very important point that have to take into account: in reason exhibition specified that it guaranteed the external quality of materials; without embargo, point *d) of the Annex *VII treats it of mood very generic.
experience *nos has shown that, from determined sizes, plant do not has possibility to survive in a half, as it occurs in zones of the south of *Europa, in that drought conditions are very extreme.
The euro do not constitutes #one dip in himself\/hisself same, but an instrument to service of citizen, of a strong economy, of employment, of the international position of the European Union.
The considering *K, in the that it collects complaint on the nonexistence of practical advantages immediate of the banking euro, is a trace of the high hopes that had the majority of Parliament and that, apparently, continues having.
With reason insists the speaker in the need of an accurate preparation for the introduction of the euro and *nosotros go to see that the euro will obtain really confidence of citizens and of citizens and no only the of the markets since , meanwhile, finds already *asentado in #this.
But is not less true -and also has put of relief along the debate- that moment of the reality, moment of the truth, will be *cuando go in in vigour coins and notes: on 1 January of the 2002.
The situation of the market, no only regarding negotiations of the *OMC, and the new understanding of the traditional habits by the new persons will modify also the contents and the importance of the subjects in the commission.
Seen that -and already has remembered this morning- according to data facilitated by the Commission, the 60% of products *pesqueros that consume in the European Union are mattered, #would be necessary to back considerable and amply aquaculture that represents an important economic opportunity for the maritime communities.
Nevertheless, is extremely important that the proposal treat also the requirements in matter of information that on the quality of the air has to provide to the public opinion splitting of a very accurate follow-up of level of *benceno and of monoxide of carbon.
opinion surveys show, in effect, at least in *Francia, that the percentage of persons that propose to open account in euros in a next future, diminishes regularly from 1 January 1999, and today only affects to a small minority.
But the European Parliament wishes *sacarlos of error and *preconiza once again information campaign that, quote the resolution approved, "answer to the practical questions and explain the basic meaning of the monetary union".
Regarding the period that initiates on 1 January 2002, in that they will circulate simultaneously two coins, period that, in the terms of the Treaty, #can extend until six months, share the opinion of Mrs. Speaker and of the Council *Ecofin, according to the *cual this period #would have to reduce to two months.
Change the *OMC affects, finally, to mood of current operation, that follows based in diplomacy of the summits and of secret in moment of the citizen irruption in the subjects of the world.
proof is the supremacy in the taking of decisions of some #few *decenas of rich countries. proof is the increase of inequalities among rich and poor countries, and also in the interior of the own countries.
*Europa, finally, do not has to forget to defend our specificities no only economic, but also cultural and social, because globalisation of uniformity, of the *achatamiento and of exploitation do not has to form part at all of the model of #european development.
Now well, #all know that, without a special deal for agriculture, will not be possible to guarantee a minimum of community preference, neither, therefore, the guarantee of the primary productive function of agriculture.
have put of self-evident two things.: the first is that in the future will follow contemplating this *mescolanza of interests in the frame of the international negotiations, and wanted to *sumarme to posture of economists notable that affirm that #this has not been more that the beginning.
Now well, for *nosotros, no treats to organise better the continuous release of exchanges, but to give primacy to defence of the social and environmental rights and allow to #all the populations control by himself\/hisself same and decide future.
The present report claims the resignation forced of a neglected and #amateurish Commission, and has revealed a catalogue of irresponsibilities of States members that are had to criticise, but no to act against of fraud and of irregularities.
To finalise want to underline that the Commission follows thinking -as it says the report that *usted *nos presents- to use as main indicator of hit of his financial management utilisation grade of the financial credits assigned in the annual budget.
Gentleman President, the report of 1998 of the Court of Accounts, that has been debated in #all *Europa except -until today- in this Assembly, shows the clear need that the Commission and States members intensify efforts in the fight against fraud.
In my opinion, is hit that it exist a temporary distance among the publication and the debate here in the Assembly so that #all deputies have of the possibility to know the whole of the report.
Has been an especially bad season for the Commission and a particularly difficult stage to advance by #all the normal channels, since had elections, difficulties of the Commission, #etcetera.
The subject of finance and of cast of the financial charges has to be the subject of a debate in the widest frame of the regional organisations of fishing.

Wanted to give the thanks to *Willi *Rothley, the speaker, by the excellent preparation of this report and by the initiative that then also had arisen of Parliament. But also *le give the thanks to the Commission and to the Council by his substantial approval.
Believe that the report of Mr. *Rothley has to be approved in group, since it is commitment of high level and the synthesis of a series of stimuluses and innovative concepts, fruit of collaboration among the distinct institutional instances.
According to this agreement, Swiss authorises a maximum number of community trucks of commodities of more of 28 tonnes that will be able to cross Swiss until the year 2005, date in that this country, adapting rule to the community, will not demand permission #any for trucks inferior to 40 tonnes.
To the project of application of transport agreement among the EU and Swiss that starts now knot hope that in the future was easier the *superación of the alpine central space.
To the invite to *Turquía to an increasingly narrow cooperation, the Union acts of agreement to his fundamental mission to consolidate peace and to boost fulfillment of the human rights.

The step that has given in direction to the opening of negotiations with six new States candidates and recognition of *Turquía as Been candidate form indispensable part of the #european politics to consolidate stability and the welfare in our continent.
After the unanimous decision on the enlargement process #can not and do not has to *subsistir doubt regarding seriousness of our will and the will of *Turquía that they fulfil it prompter possible the criteria of *Copenhague.
treats of minimum progresses, but *les guarantee -and #this is the important message that want to give- that in this sense the Commission and President of Parliament have kept a same line to expand the presence of Parliament.
*Yo expect that the Commission loan an authentic support in this context, in the sense of the contribution to peace and to conflict prevention in the region, which is, in effect, much more important that troops decided in *Helsinki.
reforms allocated to boost a dynamic competition and flexibility have to be compatible with the requirement of the maintenance, but at the same time also of modernisation of the systems of social security.
work has not finished with the Summit of *Helsinki, that has developed of way very satisfactory regarding this subject and in the that #Grecia, especially, has kept a very remarkable attitude and *Turquía also has acted of reasonable way to end of accounts.
But suits that we say here that we do not accept that the European Parliament remain in a position *subalterna in any process of debate so important like a review of the Treaty of the European Union of this importance.
In the budgets that are, the European Parliament increases number of new civil servants of way that is not in accordance with the financial austerity. is not it, at least, in comparison with the increases of the last five years.
#All *nosotros have to *adaptarnos to this new and -create *yo- hopeful methodology of work with the Commission, that is the free debate, but, as it knows His *Señoría, in accordance with the regulations this free debate, in occasion, has to see directly -and therefore it has created- with the statement that the Commission finishes to take and the subjects in *ella tackled.
Taking into account the important consequences that #can have this subject, the Commission will take follow-up of the process and file will not close before this institution have security that they fulfil the principles of transparency and of equality of deal.
Maybe His *Señoría wanted to pose this question to the diverse States members, boost the participation in the inferior grades of category "To" to watch by that, with the step of the years, have more women available to end to assume places of direction.
#If *usted pretends to fund *Kosovo, #if it wants to respect commitments *algo precipitated that President of the Commission has purchased regarding this region, as well, *dénos the budgetary means to be serious and coherent and *dénos the possibility to review the financial perspectives.
career by the world-wide prices and the heaves of performances have put in danger it more esteemed that have: the quality of feeding and the survival of employments in the rural zones.
had not been much simpler to accept before appeals of Parliament and have averted #all precipitations of last hour, that do not benefit for nothing seriousness image and efficiency that supposes in the #european institutions?
is not very healthy, as neither it is it the fact to devote the 50 % of our debates from this afternoon to talk of a province of the #serbian State that is not member of the European Union.
nurses and doctors of the #french hospitals, that are the summit of competition, are today in strike because the budgetary austerity comes to *recortar the hospitable costs and the sanitary costs.

Regret that the Presidency #finnish of the Council withdraw now, since Finns also aspire to the nomination for a new mandate of member already accredited of the Court of Accounts.
The crisis of the Commission that finish to leave backwards has left *sobradamente patent, in effect, *cuán necessary is to have of an effective mechanism to demand responsibilities to civil servants of the EU that commit grave errors of management or even lacking graver.
Consistently, the editorial of regulation proposal by part of the Commission and of the Council has taken in getting, and even so it has been judged of little concrete and of incomplete, since it do not includes execution procedures.
#This will contribute decisively to improve competitiveness of our car industry in a world-wide plane, at the same time that will ensure a greater security and respect to the requirements of the environment, for benefit of consumers.
Gentleman President, wanted to signal that security measures deployed this week with reason of the visit of President #french have been really exemplary. *Nos congratulate that order and security have been present in moment.

Think that this environmental problem is of magnitude that is able to interest to the majority of citizens and to the public opinion, since it exists a true restlessness by the climatic change that is.
Without being against of the principle of a *imposición on broadcasts *contaminantes, create, nevertheless, that these measures have to respect two principles: by part, encourage for guaranteeing the fiscal neutrality and, on the other hand, involve to the group of the world industrialised or, at least, to the *OCDE, not to create distortions of competition or of *dumping ecological.
The publication of the Green Book on sustainable energy in *Irlanda has to be seen like a positive contribution of the sector of energy to the debate on possible solutions to the threat of the climatic change
But this need, as it expresses it the conjoint resolution presented, no means that the European Union *desinterese of the future of territory so linked to history and even culture.
This general attention of *Europa is the best practical guarantee supplementary that we #can give, the best form that have, on our part, to ensure that *Macao will see protected specificity, that we follow treating to *Macao of a specific mood, without *diluirla in a general magma.

. (*FR) With occasion of the debates that preceded to the meeting of *Seattle, #many had thought, in this Assembly, that *Europa had to begin for asking a balance of the previous cycles and that had to effect diagnostic together with the countries in roads of development, before launching to a new cycle of liberalisation.
*Seattle is a failure for #that that wished to continue blindly career to the generalisation of the *librecambio and the *mercantilización of the world and is a victory of the citizen movement in diversity, of type that the that had conducted to rejection of the *AMI.
The *Cnuced is the frame with greater legitimacy to treat the question of the foreign direct investments, inside respect of the democratic right of States to legislate in environmental and social matter.
Proposed even a moratorium for the start of negotiations, with seen to allow the realisation of said balance and to concretise reflection back on roads that follow the international commercial relations.
As it also results unavoidable, finally, outline a new commercial order -in the frame of a *mundialización based in progress and in solidarity- that respect the fundamental political rights, of the social progress and of the environment.

Like deputies are the direct democratic link with the population of the European Union, and Right Commission of Woman is a direct link with organisations and representations of women.

The foundation of the amendment 8 #can not admit in measure in that the committee in question fulfil functions of politics Committee *aduanera. will Go back on point inside moments.
In addition to *ello, in my report consider the possibility to complement the system of *tarificación based in the social costs *marginales with measures in the field of taxes related with transport. More in concrete, propose that said taxes coordinate to scale #european and that, in case, reduce.
Apart from *ello, is fundamental that launch informative campaigns in the that transport system proposed promote in front of the population like a respectful sustainable system with the environment, leaving clear that no treats to happen once again invoices to motorist without justification #any.
By part, do not loans the owed attention to construction costs, capital and maintenance and, on the other hand, includes without differentiation #any the *imputación of the called external costs. Among these costs appear #among others damages *ocasionados to the environment, saturation of traffic and accidents.
For me the solution is simple. Of the studies gives off that in actuality motorist deprived already pays the costs of infrastructure of transport that *le want to impute in concept of general taxes, imposed on fuel and taxes on vehicles.
Of course, #can think that #this is an imperfect system, but -is a fact- has imposed in history like the only able to avert chaos and a still greater absolutism that the that they are imputable to #one or sovereignty in particular.
By have not known to create the permanent forum of the big *Europa, formed by some open cooperations from the *primer moment to the SIN, on questions so vital like security and the external politics, our continent goes back to divide .
Results obviously legitimate to aspire to achieve harmonisation of the distinct disposals in the sector of transports, especially #if of way guarantees a more flowed operation of the inner market.
As definitely they know his *Señorías, States members #can authorise a maximum weight of 44 tonnes for engine vehicles of three axes that form part of vehicle combined of five or six axes to end to avert that similar vehicles deteriorate too much roads.
The report that today presents is #one of these reports of the that members of Right Commission of Woman seat proud, because sure enough it bases in a wide consensus and in collaboration of #all members.
Although in the field of this juridical foundation that, go back to repeat, *nos seems rigid and too much *restrictivo, violence is first of all, and reiterate it vigorously, rape of the human rights, reason by the *cual action against violence have to execute from approach *multidisciplinario.
Nobody *nos has said #if it is truth that truck that went in by mouth #french already was in flames to the entrance of the tunnel, and *nos entertain in reckoning a small difference of minutes, #one or two, among the #french intervention and Italian.
Was days 6 and 7 April *cuando perished 25 civil victims of militia armed that answers to the name of «*Meraputi» with the active collusion of the mobile brigade of politics unit of *elite of Indonesian.
Gentleman President, *le ask that it send protest note to Dr. *Mahathir about the deficient political trial that it has been object *Anwar #Ibrahim, protest note in accordance with the numerous resolutions of criticism that has approved Parliament in relation with *Malasia.
The creation of a court *ad *hoc is desirable, without embargo, never will rid of suspicion that it treats of a special court that already has anticipated, by like this say it, sentence and that has not offered to the imputed the guarantees that, even an imputed like *Ta *Mok, deserves.
Mr. *Port, that has to charge investigation, has received a total and boundless mandate and freedom to add resources or to use resources for ends, as it wish it.
Also owe *preocuparnos by the possible consequences *nefastas of the fact that the Commission resort of form generalised to services of a pertinent temporary personnel of the national public administrations or of industry.
It that, in general, deduces of the report of Defender of the #european Village is that confidence of the #european citizens bases in transparency, in dialogue, in clear juridical norms that *les allow to defend rights.
Gentleman President, the idea to approve program allocated to warn violence exerted against boys, teenagers and women is a generous and noble idea that #all, of course, #can subscribe.
Nevertheless, also have left clear that *nos concerns especially the modification of the juridical base. Said then that *eso *nos #would water considerably party and has blurred *algo happiness, since violence against boys and women, gentleman Commissioner, is not, of course, only a risk for health.
Have received, in day of yesterday, censorship motion against the Commission, the whole of #whose members resigned of charges of collective form on 16 May 1999.
The purpose of censorship motion, in the parliamentary Right, is to check that an Executive has lost confidence of the majority of the Assembly or, in case of rejection, that keeps confidence.
The public information on the criminal nature of acts and weight of the penal performance have to substitute to silence and to the *mansedumbre that still *les accompany with *demasiada frequency in our nevertheless developed societies.
Are desirous to see how resulted will give the guidelines on employment that the Commission agreed in the conference of *Luxemburgo and #some of the debates on the Social Bottom European and age workers advanced.
speakers, Gentlemen *McMahon and *Schiedermeier have carried out an excellent work no only in the preparation of report, but also to hour to prepare the conference of the third age in #whose conclusions bases amply said document.
To illustrate my words, stand out the fact that index of *autoabastecimiento of the American market has happened of level #zero to roughly the 165 %, whereas the *autoabastecimiento of the #european market of *lisina happened of the 84 % in 1991 to the 54 % in 1997, and tendency is to the 38 % in the 2002 #if they do not produce changes.
As it is #likely that corn using for production of industry of starch follow selling in States Joined to an inferior price to the of the community cereals, seems logical no only keep the current device of compensation of the American damage, but reinforce it considerably.
As it knows His *Señoría, for being #one of the authors of the new Regulation, section 3 of article 9 has that the relative questions to the rights and privileges of the ancient deputies require a decision of the Table.
Gentleman President, finish to know that the Council of Ministers has taken the decision to incorporate to the #european administration to employees of the group of *Schengen that work for the Council.
In relation with the monetary politics, insist in the need of independence of #ECB, so that it #can fulfil of the best possible way his committed in matter of stability of prices, and ensure the favourable conditions for growth and employment.
Is necessary to congratulate then, that in #day of elections, so much Parliament like the Commission have been able to face up to the requirements of the economy and resist of form relatively *honrosa pressures of the public opinion, of the media and of pressure groups.
Lady Speaker, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, *cuando listens to Mrs. Go *Lancker, that do not wants to have recipe book *neoliberal, #can not less that say that *nosotros neither want to take of the economic political-orientations book of socialist tales.
pretends with #this guarantee that the great orientations are test of big *envergadura to put of self-evident the will of States members to coordinate in practice, Mrs. *Lienemann, the economic politics using the instruments created to this end.
Finally, Mr. *Blot, *usted manifests fear that *me allow luxury of not sharing. *Usted fears that coordination of the fiscal systems, after the monetary union, delete also #one of the two residual possibilities of strategy against the famous asymmetric crashes.
On this subject the Commission of Budgetary Control has accepted today, before the start of this debate, a report that will be smart to be voted next Thursday together with the report on the regulation.
Is to expect that the next electoral contention treat also other important political subjects, without embargo, is now *cuando has to rid the battle of the great reforms while it still have the political will for *ello.
In this moment results that fraud and theft are form of life, engineering, and now delinquency organised is an elegant delinquency, that proceeds of the best means, that studies, that works to steal.
But act with independence, is or is not utopia *cuando States members have judicial systems in full crisis, *cuando many times the own judicial system, influenced by the executive power -because every time it respects less the separation of powers of *Montesquieu- leaves to prescribe cases absolutely flagrant of fraud in the that are thousands of millions in game?
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen colleagues, under my Presidency the Council of Ministers of Economy and Finances adopted on 15 March 1999 a clear position: understanding, swims of tolerance for fraud and corruption in the Community.
On observation formulated by Mr. *Brinkhorst concerning the question of the agencies decentralised -to the that also has referred Mr. *Kellett-*Bowman-, is essential that the Council tackle this question, on the that Parliament and the Commission agree.
Expect that the new Commission was able to learn the lesson of events that have lived so that it manage well mandate and that the failure of today clear the path to hit of the morning.
Takes more of a year, on 31 March 1998, the European Parliament decided to elaborate a report on the granting of the approval of the management to the Commission for the exercise of 1996.
do not approves the management for 1996, accounts close, and only will be able to concede the approval for 1997 -and #this finishes it to say *usted, gentleman *Bösch, with reason- *cuando have corrected deficiencies. have criticised It *nosotros and finish it to criticise also *ustedes.
By reason, neither #can close, without more, accounts of the budgetary exercise of 1996 while, for example, have not formulated claim in the case of nepotism that have ascertained.
Is true that the coincidence of this entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam with the last session *plenaria of the present Parliament do not facilitates things, but are convinced that the loyal cooperation among the institutions will allow to resolve the possible problems.
In our global assessment, #if we had followed road of no foresee unanimity, #would have had difficulties of principle a lot greater that the that will have to hour to take happen the proposal in the Council.
Roman *Prodi exposed to State Bosses and of Government his first reflections to the *respecto in his informal meeting of 14 April in *Bruselas. Is foreseen that this exchange of opinions continue in the European Council of Colony of the 3 and 4 July.
The fact that we are here debating ratification of a new President of the Commission, six months before *cuando corresponded according to the calendar is a reflection of the change of functions and perspectives of the European Union.
#This is #one *constatación important, gentleman President of the Commission: in *Europa, in the countries and #european regions #where no exists incarnation of the European Union, #where the European Union is not *solidaria, follows existing war possibility.
*Deseándole, nevertheless, that carry out a good work, expect that *usted #can resolve the challenges of the construction of *Europa having very present the problems of the environment, of health and of peace that are integral part of the rights of citizenship.
Agree, gentleman *Prodi, in the need to strengthen paper of the Commission in matter of cooperation inside the *OMC, without embargo, want to alert against the risk that for achieving #this throw by the embroiders the social dimension and take like hostages to consumers and the environment.
Go to repeat it again clearly and in no uncertain terms: have to strengthen strengths of the market, but also have to have clear that, in model, the market only #can work #if they reduce to the minimum unemployment and the social fractures in society.
In consequence, only want *decirles that *me seat responsible of the great tasks assigned to the Commission that have signalled. Share fully wish that the Commission go back, better said, assume definitively paper that the Treaties *le attribute -initiative paper and of political proposal- and that exert it with big transparency.
Believe that disposals approved have a circumstantial character, relative to find a solution to the problem of the exercise 1996, and never is well modify the general texts to solve a problem in particular.
The Group *Europa of Nations has affirmed in reiterated occasions conviction that it exists a direct relation among the reduction of the type of VAT and the improvement of employment.
Have voted sure enough in favour of this report, in particular, by section 1 -#can remain , gentleman *Dell'#Alba, remain instants-, in particular, as it said, because of section 1, with regard to the that, sure enough, do not argue that it do not adjust faithfully to the reality, but that, in our opinion, has a political meaning very clear.
Likewise, day, took #ours and attach to our report reasons of the decision of 17 December 1998, reasons that condemned to the Commission and #would have to have conducted, from stage, as *nosotros proposed, to censorship by part of the parliamentary majority.
*Yo wanted to highlight it once again with firmness and *me *congratulo that finally no only have achieved hardening of sanctions of the EU against *Yugoslavia, but also ratification of the embargo of the EU against oil.
*Nosotros also are adherents that it take all it possible in the region, but it true is that they exist pressures and, therefore, *yo urge to President of the Council to that it watch, together with Subject Minister Inner German, to achieve a greater cast and cast more *equitativo of charges.
Gentleman President, in view of the last speech, costs pity remember to this Assembly that ten years ago that practises the ethnic purification in *Kosovo and that refugees were expelled of homes a lot before NATO initiated bombardments.
Needs a new fact because bombardments no longer have effect: or continue bombing things that already have been bombed until this moment or bomb cities. The path of war is forbidden, no exists.
Think that it has been inability sample of the Council have not been able to adopt decision, and think that in some sense has been to deny to accept the consequences of acts.
The previous requirement is, without embargo, in the first place, that *Belgrado do not have doubt on the determination of the international community and, second, that comprise that a military solution do not offers perspective for Serbian neither neither, very personally, for Mr. *Milosevic.
Prepare it *apresuradamente without help of the High Representative and without the reality neither query structure with Parliament is, to trial, a sample of immoderate pride.
The current war in *Kosovo has shown once again that capacity of military intervention of the EU in case of crisis, that so much has defended in this House, is a peremptory need.
The international community has launched by the embroiders peace principle to sight of the massive attempts against the human rights and the ethnic deportations committed in *Kosovo.
Even the research of political solution tried by *Kofi *Annan in meeting with President *Yeltsin is condemned by those who fear that #if the logic finishes imposing , in front of the *despropósito and the absurd that *retroalimentan, will result damaged the military prestige of NATO and will remain ridiculed politics of #Clinton bear *Kosovo.
Is necessary to split of the northern dimension in the external relations to hour to create a common specific strategy in the that relations with *Rusia exert a fundamental function.
Also it is necessary to take into account that we have to give the step to defence politics (in this sense am clearly adherent of integration of the *UEO in the European Union) to be able to answer like this to the challenges to the that *nos confront in this moment.
To #all which adds, besides, another fact: how *les are, in fact, to the colleagues? Pretend that they vote project, that purportedly has to resolve existential problems, without having had opportunity to examine it in commission, without that the political Groups have had at least the opportunity to examine it.
Gentleman President, the report of colleague *Rothley shows aptly a series of lacks, insufficiencies and even errors of the statute project for deputies to the European Parliament that *nos has presented the Council.
Add, nevertheless, that am totally against of *europeizar function, because in this hemicycle represent to *Flandes and no to species of *Eurosuperestado, because I am totally contrary to the fiscal advantages that comports the #european statute and because I follow being adherent of a national fiscal statute that *nos grave exactly it same that to voters.
#can not accept on no account game point of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens since it do not involves thing that postponement without date of this question.
Ladies and gentlemen, first wanted to *transmitirles information: in the votes of this afternoon, Parliament has confirmed his opinions about the proposals of the Commission in the that modifies the procedure, owing to the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
*Eso is a giant step and have said to the principle of the debate: #can not avert the impression, since we were in deadlock, that always in the year, in the that change of Parliament *nos *sobreviene promotion wave.
By moment, the *APG no endows the initiative *URBAN of the Community, but the decisions in this matter will incorporate in budget proposal in a back stage of the procedure.
Therefore, wanted to *concentrarme in substance of this subject, that is, #such as they have affirmed it Mr. *Sindal and Mr. *Swoboda, a subject of essential importance, in it that my *respecta, and in measure in that it affects to politics of development of the public transport.
Through Internet provider #can offer to customers services without additional costs happening by #all borders, and consumer, without having to displace , #can compare services among the different providers of his own country and of countries.
This right #can exert only in two cases: #if agreement signed before consumer had of the contractual conditions and #if *le has incited of disloyal way to celebrate agreement during reflection term.
Regarding the #another amendment, that is the famous 22 to article 4 on retractation right, *me add to enlargement of term of thirty days for agreements. Put for example the that in said amendment mention -that *yo #would call of high risk-, as it is the of insurance *vitalicio or the of retirement pensions.
Is true that, increasingly -and #would have to be even more frequent and data that has given Mr. *Whitehead are interesting-, #would have to use the open field by Internet for contractings, even of the financial services, sector on the that consumers show more reluctant in actuality; and is true, gentleman *Whitehead, that *never, *never, *never, *at *the *expense *of *the *consumer .
It last is only a recommendation, more did not want Parliament by #a lot of that *yo regret it, but with time perhaps producers perceive #this like a possibility to obtain better opportunities of commercialisation of products in #all parts of the inner market.
#If the solution #can not be repair or change, buyer has still the right to a suitable reduction of price or to the cancellation of agreement.
The only object of the proposal is to ensure that in place that consumers take shopping in the European Union, enjoy of a minimum level of guarantees and #can appeal in resource in country of origin.
In front of the insistence of this Assembly, the free repairs or replacement also will include sending costs, drama hand and materials.
With difficulties that the population has to take out his agricultural products of there and difficulties that had euro-deputies to get to these populations, no *me explain, *cuando there #be catastrophe, how is possible that #can *afrontarla without sufficient means.
Gentleman President, to be brief, because of the big volume of subjects that have to debate in Plenary this afternoon and had account of the late hour, propose *limitarme to some #few pertinent observations on my report, that has been elaborated in name of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer.
Want to express time with clarity, that in Parliament *nos have based always in the affirmations of scientists, as for example affirmations of the *ESPEGAM, that has defended the clear position that while it did not have *ADI for babies, has to apply a strict value of *cuasi zero.
*Le say sincerely, and *eso knows it of the previous debates: had preferred that it had renounced to the directive on foods for sportsmen, since #this *nos carries to #one *desinformación, since it will be very difficult to reach clear disposals for the different sports, since feeding differs a lot according to sport type and will be difficult to propose determined foods for determined sports.
do not want *referirme to *ellos, but yes wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to indicate it following: by #a lot of that *nos have taken to advance *Amsterdam in the practical parliamentarism, do not have to overlook that *nos is missing still enough to reach a real parliamentarism in the European Union.
hit of the procedure of *codecisión, in the first years of operation, went definitely, for the last Conference *Intergubernamental, a clear signal to expand his field to almost #all the main legislative activities.
The decision did not have at all that see with the fact that they went pictures of homosexual or no -question that do not know-, but simply with the fact that the content of exhibition considered offensive for part of the Assembly and of persons that *transitan by *ella.
*Quinto: the preparation of our institution for the next #european elections; some elections in the that do not chooses to the *pariente poor of the community institutions, but to Parliament that citizens see for the first time endowed of big can and able to exert it.
there #be not alive democracy #where there #be not an alive parliament, neither alive parliament that do not arouse distrust and discomfort of turn executive.
On the one hand, because it exists the need of more *Europa, exists the need of a greater paper of *Europa in the world and the historical context-politician *nos shows it, and #if no will exist institutions renewed and a strong political will, this need of *Europa will not be able to fulfil specifically.
Lady Speaker, gentlemen Presidents, estimated colleagues, in this Assembly have seen that the operation of the Presidencies is not a question that depend so much of the corresponding country or of aptitudes of leaders but of the dynamics of the Union.
Believe that Parliament, in November resolution to the that has alluded president Of #Giovanni, proposed *algo original, and is *algo so original like simple: resort to the community method, to method to the that are *habituados, to prepare the institutional reform.
Now is moment to give body to identity of the #european defence, at least #if the European Council comprise it that there #be in game and converts Colony Summit in hit.
For example, the Federal Republic of *Alemania already has presented plan and is in realisation, has put to disposal two one thousand millions of frames for a special program for the creation of 100.000 places of work and of training for youngsters stopped.
Parliament has been informed to regulate and totally on progress of works with Diary 2000 and the suggestions of Parliament has been included in considerations of the Commission and of the Council.
Without embargo, go to call attention on the last example of disposal to commitment of the Council in front of Parliament, to know, the *prosecución of the community initiative *URBAN, that has reached to instances of the European Parliament.
In this way, no only strengthens the sustainable development of the rural areas but that besides takes possible the *codecisión of the European Parliament in agricultural questions, as these costs go to reflect in the future like costs no compulsory.
citizens of *Europa (the of the fifteen countries members and the of the countries candidates to adhesion, the of *Europa oriental and the of *Chipre) expect and demand that the European Union was a real Union, political and social, with prestige and strength, and that like this #can exert a leading paper worldwide in front of the year 2000.
The answer of the majority of this Assembly in day of today is not to the height of commitments regarding his own constituents neither of the expectations of the public opinion.
Have voted in favour of the amendment presented by the Liberal Group about the question of wages and compensations of Parliament because it is the only possibility to reach reform so *trabajosa and demanded as it is #this.
Expect with interest assist to the evolution of this subject, but #can not give my support to the directive in his current state and thus *me have abstained in the final vote in that it has approved the text.
By the contrary, the proposal has to build on the base of minimum rules, that make possible to the countries members the maintenance of norms more strict and *les give freedom for *hacerlas even more rigorous #if like this they wish it.
In my country *nos ensured #one and time that the European Union #would not be *militarizada, and without embargo, are #many the reports that have happened by Parliament during the five years that have been here that indicate clearly that the EU advances in this direction.
Like proof, an emblematic passage: «the examination of the common strategy regarding *Rusia inscribes in a political context that has modified with intervention armed of NATO against the Yugoslav Federation.
The big majority of my political group goes to give his affirmative vote to the Agreement *Interinstitucional on the financial planning to half term and, of course, go to give it also to parts of Diary 2000 that require of assent.
Expect that commitment of Mr. Go give *Broek to examine the possibility that it have a special line in the budget for finance of *Chipre take reality, because we #can not have two weights and two measures.
The conclusion that extract to the *respecto is that #if it do not reaches definitively plant the #european interest above the national interests, will not reach to get to politics of economic cohesion and social really advanced.
This informal procedure is a continuous exchange of information, a fruitful dialogue that has taken possible the inclusion of the priorities of Parliament in the definite text of *Berlín, although they remain #some requirements that will be negotiated in back meetings to *Berlín.
Likewise, Parliament receives with big satisfaction the approval of appeal that the Union assume an active paper in the promotion of a durable peace and of prosperity in *Irlanda of the North.
The first priority was to guarantee the continuation of Bottom, and the Council reached to approve the opinion of Parliament that the basic goals of Cohesion Bottom follow being today so important as in 1992.
These projects will mark a real and tangible difference in the lives of millions of citizens that live in the most remote regions and less developed of the Community.
A *desliz of Parliament, or simply a no responsible exercise of competitions, #can *llevarnos to approve #some amendments that prevented to close tomorrow this important regulation and that the #european regions #can not, in consequence, program performances for the first of January of the year 2000.
Although no exist determination *porcentual for credit assignment, *nos have put of agreement on a strengthening of the positive politics of labour market and of the specific helps for women.
Thus, is even more important that -and east is also hit of Parliament- have of some generous transitory regulations that guarantee that they do not produce some painful and *contraproducentes interruptions of helps and that the regions have six years of time to adapt to changes.
To reach it intensify contacts with the Commission and the Council, multiply dialogues *tripartitos, and even celebrate an informal seminar with the Presidency and the Commission in *Viena to treat of flexibility.
Budget Commission has supported the proposal to include capital deprived in finance of projects of networks and has posed the possibility to increase said participation of the 1 % until the 2 %.
Increasing the possibilities of persons to keep work place, to achieve work place or another better is *algo that we #can take with help of the Social Bottom European.
The Presidency goes to restart the subject after consulting with partners, especially with *Finlandia, in the frame of the second Committee of Cooperation EU-*Ucrania that will celebrate in July and will include it among the official subjects of conversations among the EU and *Ucrania.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, with spirit constructive that, glimpse, *subyace in answer, #can *concretarme exactly how will take the European Union to contribute to the cessation of violence and how measured will adopt also to contribute to that combat corruption in *Argelia?
Without embargo, no treats of an isolated fact but of an assessment of general character that tongue #swedish seldom uses *cuando the #swedish representatives negotiate in the Council.
Subject: Member of the Commission, competent for equality of opportunities among men and women In accordance with articles 2, 3, 137.1 and 141 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, equality of opportunities among men and women has to be #one of the greater worries of the European Union.
Also have thought to ask #if it has argued how goes to take to boost actively equality of opportunities among men and women after the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, *cuando #all the groups, also women, want to use article 13 on discrimination.
After the shy proposal of the Commission, the agreements of *Berlín have supposed course backwards in limitation of helps to the great exploitations and the increase of support to the small and average.
Is of receipt, in moment in the that #all legitimately sue more *Europa in employment and in general in the structural reform, in the enlargement process of the EU, in help *solidaria by #one *Europa greater, celebrate like hit of *Berlín that #all want to that in the future *Europa *nos cost less?
The truth is that the budget do not goes to give for this «rural development», that #would be, in fact, form to balance the most disadvantaged regions in relation with the most favoured.
Some final words on the Common Agricultural Politics and the resultant reform of *Berlín, is to say, the absence of reform: *Berlín no *reequilibró neither promoted, in fact, investment of the existent discriminations among productions and agriculturalists.
And is truth that regarding Diary 2000 pose important *interrogantes: the #european agricultural strategy, future alimentary, the structural politics, finance of *Europa, by not mentioning the opening to the East.
Also is undoubted that the fact of *dedicarnos to introduce zones of free change in the international market represents a danger -for example, Mr. #Martin mentioned it takes moment regarding the *viticultores, alluding to the case of *Suecia and *Irlanda, that have converted in viticultural zones, it that *les allows to obtain musts concentrated for perhaps manufacture industrial wines.
*Loyola of Palace has hidden that the 550.000 tonnes of increase of quota *lechera do not have right to premium and, in the *vacuno, the increases will not compensate the reduction *pactada of the 20 % of prices, producing a reduction of incomes in this sector of some 30.000 millions of pesetas.
The fact that negotiations have translated in results in moment that coincides with the resignation of the Commission constitutes a sample more of performance capacity of the European Union.
Gentleman President, go to use ten seconds of my lovely time to congratulate to Commissioners and to President here present, especially by stoicism to be here with *nosotros to hour of the night.
In renunciation have influenced convincingly pressures exerted by Fishing Commission of Parliament, #whose unanimous posture has exerted paper swims *desdeñable to hour to revoke this decision.
Always has been a grave and serious problem that the European Parliament has watched often with distrust, also because no always resulted clear #who was manager and of how way was possible control and information by part of the European Parliament.
Means that paper of the Commission remains *inalterado, but also takes *algo easier, because the Commission no longer sees situated in front of a uniform front of States members that say: Yes; only want to go back exactly to *aquello that already had agreed in our common position.
Wanted to *agradecerles to #all cooperation with Group, #as well as to Parliament and to Mr. *Hughes, the one who has been an excellent president in #everything it relative to this question, very *perseverante, like the skaters that begin career with a bit of slowness but that, to base of continuity, reaches an excellent result when getting to the dip.
Himself\/Hisself wanted to, gentleman President, take advantage of this debate to say two things that *me seem important: first, reiterate observation that has taken Mrs. #Miranda that the #mexican Government has to assume commitment to withdraw this unilateral rise of tariffs.
Without embargo, believe that the conclusion of the agreement will facilitate continuity of dialogue around these questions, which will plant to *Europa in a much more favourable position that #if it had not gone out forward this agreement.
modalities of participation, as for example observer statute, did not respect the legitimate wishes of *Islandia and Norwegian to follow taking part in the process of taking of decisions in matter of *Schengen in the future.
Apart from the association agreement that finish to describe and #whose draft *les have remitted takes little, the Protocol of *Schengen foresees the approval of agreement that determine the juridical relation among Norwegian and *Islandia, on the one hand, and among Big *Bretaña and *Irlanda, by #another, in the fields of the *acervo of *Schengen that apply to States.
No fits doubt that control has to develop of an effective mood, and is necessary to demand to Norwegian and *Islandia criteria that demand to States members of the Union in #everything it relative to border control and to #some looks of the fight against delinquency.
But to the contrary of it that occurred, for example, with the directive on author rights in society of information, in occasion have had the opportunity to keep a brief debate *esclarecedor to the *respecto.
My question to Commissioner *Liikanen is #if, nevertheless, results acceptable form in that the amendment 48 has been formulated by the Commission of Juridical Subjects do not convert like this to Internet servers in *censores?
And since, as it said a famous writer of my country, «the morning is uncertain», take advantage of occasion to hail and express my gratitude to #all the colleagues, civil servants and interpreters with the *cuales have shared these five fundamental years for the #european construction.
*Ello no means, without embargo, that the institutions do not have of the sufficient autonomy to decide to increase the requirements contemplated in the Treaty in determined occasions, especially *cuando is in game character *vinculante of the maximum type of increase, #such as it stipulates article 203.
Takes a year decide to approve an interim agreement so that, in the meantime, #can negotiate the global agreement. And in moment said explicitly that we #would not approve the global agreement until they had not stipulated #all elements that compose it.
The Government *laborista did not lose time to hour to establish some new strict criteria for the public life in Realm Joined *cuando got to power two years ago.
On the other hand, subscribe the idea of simplification of the financial management. Create likewise indispensable to hold responsible to States members and control utilisation of subventions agreed in virtue of bottoms; of it contrary, the risks of fraud will multiply.
The future of the rural world presents more uncertain by what the Commission and Parliament, permanently concerned by *apropiarse of new fields of competition, procure to make an urban politics integrated, without taking into account subsidiariness principle.
Believe besides that the best way to reach a more efficient finance of the #european politics raisin for concentrating said finance in measures absolutely more important, in place to create *minipresupuestos that *engullen too much money of States members.
treats of #that that expand to infinite the field of the community regulation, and that today, under the effect of the bureaucratic and administrative obstruction that have caused, demand simplification of the existent procedures.
Later, has to summon an international conference on the *Balcanes under the auspices of the *NU and of the *OSCE with the goal to stabilise the situation in the region and to guarantee in *Kosovo the establishment of an advanced autonomy inside the current borders.

Gentleman President, lamentably, to the equal that in December of 1997, have to go back to *ocuparnos of rapes of the human rights in *Djibuti, in particular of the situation of the political prisoners that no only find subjected to illegal arrest -for *nosotros unacceptable-, but also to vexation type that, in #some cases, has *ocasionado death of #some of *ellos.
The Government of *Djibuti engaged to respect these principles also through participation in the Agreement of *Lomé, #whose article 5 foresees that part signatory has to fulfil the principles of respect of the human rights and of democratisation of country.
Gentleman President, lady speaker, *Señorías, wish first of all congratulate to the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens and, in particular, to colleague *Gebhardt by the excellent work that have taken together and by the tenacity that have shown in the conciliation procedure.

since statistics of sake exchanges *intracomunitarios always are necessary, has created *INTRASTAT, and companies have been forced to provide the necessary variables to allow that organism make said statistical.
By it that refers to the first proposal, relative to the reduction of the number of variables collected, the conciliation procedure allowed to get to a satisfactory result in relation with the initial proposal of the Commission.
And do not deny that the content of the proposal of the Commission of principles of the years eighty deserves my support. Said of mood, subscribe the content, but do not approve method *intergubernamental.
costs derived of mechanism installation of interception run to charge of operator of telecommunication network. To avert distortions of competition is indispensable that these costs are similar in #all the inner market.
agreement project will constitute the juridical frame for interception of #all telecommunication forms in the EU that results necessary to put in practice surveillance system EU-FBI.
Mr. *Schulz has said with clarity it that Mr. *Schmid has exposed by writing: this recommendation of the Council do not modifies in it more minimum the juridical situation in States members.
Lady Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, before at all wanted to congratulate to Mr. *Hoppenstedt for having known, in his last intervention, *llevarnos with precision to the essential point of the question: take compatible to man, nature and the modern technician.
These two bodies are program detailed of activities and communication strategies in accordance with communication lines of the Commission and the report of the Commission of Culture.
*Señorías, our political activity is not *desenfrenada, but the #can compare to train, no to train of high speed, but to commodity train, but trains do not advance #if there are not rails, and these rails are the that avert that *nos divert.
By reason, #can say today, with independence of where *nos seat in this Assembly, it following: #if it exists a political justice, even in this European Parliament, this political justice has taken reality with the election of #Nicole *Fontaine for Speaker of the European Parliament.
*Cuando gave by closed the assembly to finals of May, had an unanimous backrest and a strong ovation of #all plenary by form so glorious in the that has conducted the sessions along the last term of office.
With contribution to the peaceful conclusion of conflict of *Kosovo, the civil power that is the EU achieved to advance a fundamental step to a Common External Politics.
The preparation of a #european Letter of fundamental rights that decided in Colony has by object guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens receive in the #european field consideration that have in the national field.
Is evident that the last events that have observed in the *OMC and form as they go to develop the new negotiations and, in particular, the designation of the General Director wanted by the Americans for the *primer cycle of the *OMC are of very bad *augurio for the #european interests.
The last look, the subject of *Kosovo, has shown also, *me seems, the #european impotence and his total diplomatic dependency and military of the dominant military power and of NATO.
With regard to criticisms to the institutional reforms: have tried *hacerlas advance and *cuando kept my first intervention here to the *hacerme load of the Presidency of the Council was not still at all clear #if we went to obtain really the approval for a Conference *Intergubernamental.
The challenge that have in front of #all *nosotros is in reconstructing the credibility of the European Union in front of citizens and in ensuring that #this comprise the advantages that the European Union offers to his daily life.
#Any one that say today that we have to approve or refuse the Commission, the one who say #this here in Parliament or out of Parliament, is it as the «*hearings» are an important part of the whole of the process and, time passed, will be able to decide freely #if we give assent to the Commission or no.
Go to take all it possible -at least my political Group- so that in the frame of audiences foresee also a sufficient time for candidate and candidate as hour and average, #such as it is foreseen up to now, is not sufficient but that need at least three hours so that we #can keep a fine conversation *decisoria.
The Commission is defender of the Treaties and *usted has employed the concept of the Government, a concept that *me enjoys personally because it involves that this Government has a parliamentary responsibility and has to answer also in front of Parliament.
Lady Speaker, in September will have audiences and, as I already have said, do not wish to anticipate how have to develop , but the big preference of my Group is that in September -subject always to reservations that it will be necessary to see it that goes *sucediendo- will have to take a decision and *desembarazarnos of a feeling of crisis.
The tragedy of *Kosovo, and in sense more general the tragedies of the type of the *sucedida in *Yugoslavia, are fine sample that stability and peace brought by integration of *Europa still do not issue rays much more there of the external borders of the Union.
The launching of the new coin of the euro definitely will help to reduce the commercial costs of small and medium enterprises when converting operations *cambiarias in eleven countries in *algo of the past.
To boost the competitive capacity, growth and employment, the #finnish Government proposes, aptly, favour coordination of the economic politics, of employment and structural and complete the inner market.

Gentleman President, gentleman President in exercise of the Council in day of première, gentleman President of the Commission, *Señorías, formulated the question on the case *Bangemann because I believe that it poses a question of enormous actuality, that is the ethical behaviour of the public charges.
In this context, *nosotros, also deputies, have to struggle by some clear statutes, some rules of the clear game and *elaborarlas, as it do not serves of a lot throw stones to the roof of the other and not seeing that #one sometimes is under ceiling.
Are the that #would say, and have, create *yo, reason of part, that disposals of article 213 of the Treaty and references to honesty and discretion mean for #any one that comprise the criteria required in the public life, little more #would need to say, or at all.
By discounted that it had wished that #ours *primer find during the period of the Presidency #finnish had occurred in circumstances, which *me had allowed to expose #all the essential priorities of work program.
Thus no fits the lower doubt that legislation of the Community has to be reformed with the end to guarantee that the quality of products of animal origin was entirely reliable.
*Déjenme *decirle *algo to President of the Council: in #some parts has said that the Council was concerned, as the crisis of dioxin has put of self-evident that effects affect to #all the Union, and that the Council wants to act of transparent and responsible way.
Think that in an economic and ecological disaster of #this *envergadura has to have value to look for and signal the causes and in case also to the guilty, no by any inopportune form of grudge, but to avert that they repeat this type of problems in the future.
And here want to remember, for example, how the community institutions have not followed the recommendations and requirements of Parliament, that asked the prohibition of meat flours and bones in the animal feeding.
Therefore, propose it following: open of course investigation, but first take a study in depth of the systems to face up to the sanitary and alimentary panics of #all States members, beginning with an evaluation of the #british system.
The possible reforms are *reexpedidas to level of Fight Unit *Antifraude and of the own Roman *Prodi, that yesterday *nos explained that it went to fix almost all modifying the internal operation of the Commission and proposing a code of behaviour of members.
#This #would have supposed, for example, apply disciplinary measures against the organisers of the European Championship of 1996, because in occasion, the followers benefited of plans of sale of entrances that favoured to fans of the country with regard to fans of foreigner.
The organisers of the *Eurocopa 2000 that will celebrate in *Bélgica and in the Low Countries, for example, already have put in contact with the Commission and, in consequence, have adapted sale system to the requirements of the community legislation.
#If Commissioner *Kinnock *me is #if *yo believe that the European Commission #can really help to football of better base that the anonymous societies multinationals that only look for benefits, #would vote by the European Commission.
Lady Speaker, our ancient Socialist colleague #belgian Mr. Of *Coene and *yo head the group of 30 deputies to the European Parliament that carried the case in front of the Upper Court of #París the past year.
#If the Commission had pursued this *incumplimiento of article 82 with energy that pursues the *incumplimientos in other fields of industry, this fine #would not have been of 600 pounds, but of 6 millions of pounds or more.
With occasion of Glass of football World, *Señorías, have seen to thousands of *Zidane and of #Marcel *Dessailly in small, that displaced of the popular quarters of *Marsella, of *Tolosa and of *Estrasburgo to applaud exploits of the big *Zidane, of the big *Dessailly, and also of the big #Owen, of the big *Beckam, of the big Say #Pietro.
Is wise, given the circumstances, demand to the great football quantities of money and deposit it in arks of the European Commission, or it wise is to take measures that guarantee that in the future will not go back to produce discriminatory sales of entrances for football or any #another international tournament?
*Nosotros pay expensive, maybe, the not having been able to take it, but *le #would ask to Parliament an analysis *sosegado of the second inform of the Committee. And afterwards that, after the explanations of Mr. *Kinnock, comprise that the Commission will need *algún time, and that they are *ustedes time a bit more generous.
Forty-two years after the creation of this institution, it is necessary to remember to the ancient School, quote: the need "to hold responsible to commissioners, from the preparation of a proposal until application" .
Because the financial Regulation never has elaborated it quite the right of agreements" . #One #can not leave to have the worrisome impression, *cuando reads sentence like #this, that reasoning is incomplete.
And, to end of accounts, theory of the independence of the Commission, credited by the federalistic, but that conducts to weaken controls, has not provided *acaso a favourable terrain for irregularities and frauds *impunes?
Especially, the Commission promises to displace systematically of the traditional dependency of the #ex financial control-in front of to a system integrated of financial management in the that responsibilities of individual civil servants are clearly clear-cut, evaluated and reinforced.
Consider urgently necessary that the recommendations taken to this *respecto by the Report of Experts, and with independence of the statements that have taken commissioners designated, are collected in program of the next conference *intergubernamental and impose by road of the Treaties.
is not moment to go in in details, as in the Commission of Budgetary Control, thanks to the proposal that have made, will have opportunity to follow of wall the task of Commissioner *Kinnock.
Gentleman President, debate wall report of 200 pages that contains an exhaustive analysis of the structural operation of services of the Commission, and only have been able to have 48 hours to read it and *reflexionar on #the same.
will Be *ustedes of agreement *conmigo in affirming the importance of this community frame of cooperation with the that it pretends to back and complete the work of States members in the field of the accidental marine pollution, precisely with the goal of *hacerla more effective.
Of it contrary, in front of the first crisis that *sobrevenga in front of lack of inspections of a Been member and of a #european logic of inspections, will resort to an independent agency, that will be necessary to create to manage the question of feeding, for example, as we #can check it *cuando debate said question.
Create firmly that Parliament #would have to give all support to this report and that #would have to issue a message so much to the Commission as to the Council that have the intention that these essential measures are not diluted or weakened in form.
The consequence #would be that production #would displace to the country #where governed the worst environmental norms; the environment #would be then the big loser and #would punish to States members that yes take seriously the environmental legislation.
do not go to occur it that *le has occurred to this spiritual leader of Occident that is Mr. *Stoiber, President of the Government of *Baviera, that did not achieve that minister *Sauter was goat piacular and accepted to resign and has had to resort to the corresponding Parliament.
offers that *nos formulates, substantially demanded by my Group, constitute a clear commitment with the #european integration and #all intention statement to representation of citizens that has Parliament.
The euro is an instrument, an intermediate stage: is condition, a half to be able to carry prosperity to #all, so that it #can happen to politics that are the fundamental chapter that have in front of *nosotros, and the final goal, #this is, more growth, more development and more employment.
Because it has mentioned *usted with #everything hit the word "responsibility" like key concept, no only in the *primer report of the wise persons, but also like need to solve the problems in the future. collegiate Responsibility, but also individual, of members of his Commission and -think also- responsibility of civil servants.
Gentleman professor *Prodi, is *usted man of big talent, is surrounded also of men and of women also of big talent: professor *Monti, gentleman *Barnier, gentleman *Busquin, that survived #where lady *Cresson dropped by jam pot, and this full Commission of talent goes to have early the big appointment of *Seattle.
The vote of Thursday is an important opportunity to send to the new Commission warning that the principle by the that it guides *Bruselas #can not be attitude that here it has not happened at all.
The nomination of Mr. *Kinnock and of Mr. *Patten underlines clearly the impression of that the nomination for the Commission is in effect prize of *consolación to compensate the political rejection in his own country.
This morning, gentleman President, has affirmed that wishes a whole and effective administration, some competent and free commissioners of suspicion, a political program for the next five years in total communication with Parliament.
Like person and like President of the Commission, explains *usted with confidence even of deputies of the Union that see with a big scepticism to squad, which means that *usted personally will be able to have the affirmative vote of Group in both votes.
Gentlemen Presidents, the world, from *Kosovo until *Timor Oriental, needs to *Europa, the *Europa of the Institutions of the Union, and the European Union needs a fine relation among the Council, the Commission and Parliament to enjoy of #all confidence of his *conciudadanos.
*Nosotros, deputies #greek of the party *Nea *Dimocratía, further of reservation, *le will give the vote to his Commission, in the first place because we expect that they respect *ustedes commitments contracted here the past week, and second because we agree with the content of statement of today.
Parliament has interest in defending powers of the Commission and mainly right of initiative, without which weight of the Governments and of the national bureaucracies #would be overwhelming.
Especially is a scandal that take to happen to man like the right hand of the ancient President of the Commission, Mr. *Delors, the one who is responsible of training of the criticised services of security, in front of Parliament without that it receive at least an alone critical question.
Never have to allow that a government use the Commission like house of retreat of politicians that - using term affine to consumers - have exceeded caducity "date" or as *recompensa political to ancient friends or even to export to *Europa a national embarrassment.
*Nosotras want to that *usted commission to reach significant improvements in income, in access to power and to money, and that #one to our fight against the daily discrimination of women and against violence.
Due to the fact that we had to leave time to the delegations of other commissions, neither deputies of my Group neither our commission neither members of the delegations had sufficient time to formulate #all the questions that wished to candidates *Liikanen and *Lamy.
Also in look, *yo #can affirm in name of my Group that the Commission seems to have the firm will to regulate in the round of #millenium, #among others subjects, questions like norms *agrosociales and also the #european environmental disposals.
Gentleman President, *le appreciate that *me have mentioned, even unintentionally, because *yo have got to the European Parliament like leader of the Party of Pensioners that has gone in for the first time in Parliament to represent the needs of the greater persons.
*Me remembered to a famous duet of humorists of Realm Joined - *Morecombe and *Wise - in the that #Eric *Morecombe *aporreaba tail piano and took noise frightful, and *André *Previn *le said "*te #this *equivocando in #all notes" , to it that *él answered, "notes are #all well, the problem is that no the touch in the correct order" .
With regard to Category 5, the #sad side is that we do not see that the Council propose solutions on mood to resolve the problem of pensions in breast of the institutions.
In this context, is important that the European Parliament, #whose action this last year has been remarkable, take to hear voice after the resolution adopted in session *plenaria of April that already established the political frame that now precise.
As it said before, the *concretización of a space of freedom, of security and justice is a fundamental goal for *acercar the Union to citizens, and this question forms part of the daily worries of citizens of the Union.
On the other hand, *me cheer that the Popular Party European, with support of the friends of security of this House, have reached to impose initiative in spite of the Group of the *socialdemócratas, that denied to examine the subject.
A lot has said about the suitability to take the most difficult life for criminals, but the harmonisation of offences and sanctions is an ambitious project.
This type of attempts against the free expression, leaving sideways to citizens, *cuando prepares the space of security and of justice, awake suspicion that space will not be so free and transparent as they demand traditions.
The countries members of the EU, like previous condition to reach peace and security in *Europa, have to work more actively by peace, security, economic growth and democracy in the bordering poor countries to the EU.
Is evident that want that prime ministers offer protection against threats like delinquency organised, drug traffic, terrorism and the sexual offences, but also have to occupy of the threats of discrimination and racism.
Ask applause for *ellos so much more what that news of another grave tremor of earth, in northwest of *Turquía, Monday, so only some weeks after the tragic events that have affected to this same region, *nos has inspired a big affliction.
In name of the European Parliament, wanted to express charm deeper to the Big National Assembly and to village of *Turquía by the grave losses that *les has supposed this natural catastrophe.
#If they establish social and economic rights #whose finance was too much dependent of the public sector, simultaneously with the improvement of the social level inside the Union go to grow also the walls that *nos separate of the external world.
politics rather will have to relate *decididamente with development politics and cooperation, that, with the step of time, lady Speaker of the Council, and had account of the economic means that have arbitrated, seems that it has not obtained results.
Estimate that the Commission has to recognise also that the content expanded of the procedure of *codecisión means that Parliament has authority in directive promulgation and regulations of the European Union that correspond to 38 economic sectors and social different.
The procedure of *codecisión covers a wide range of activities, with inclusion of activities of the sector of transport, regional subjects, social questions, initiatives in matter of employment, structural finance, protection of consumer, public health and the environmental worries.
*Me am to the global autonomy, to the capacity and exclusive competition that keeps the Basque Country in fiscal matter, of collection of #all taxes, taxes and public exactions, #as well as in the budgetary looks and of public cost.
Neither have been able to give our seen well to this Commission for the following period since #some of candidates have not engaged *unívocamente to assume the total and individual responsibility that corresponds to charge that occupy.
intervention of President of the Commission puts end to #all work in the commissions, in the that has had the opportunity to appreciate the political positions of the diverse Commissioners.
Concerning the external politics and of defence, has underlined the insistence in the federalistic path and of strengthening of the militaristic positions of the *PESC, instead of the decisive stake by cooperation politics.
The strong pressure exerted on deputies of the European Parliament so that they approve the new Commission, allowing of form that go back to normality" in activities, it is necessary *contrastarla with the deep doubts and reservations that characterise to #some looks of squad of *Prodi.
During winter of 1998\/1999 the European Parliament reached age majority, caused the resignation of the Commission *Santer and of way established place that *le corresponded in the political order European.
#This shows that Parliament and Budget Commission act with total responsibility in economy questions of the European Union and in development of different political, and also is proof of adaptation capacity to new situations.
Besides #this #would take that intervention of an international strength of peace #can not consider interference in the #indonesian sovereignty, but help of the international community to an independent State and sovereign.
The socialist Group demanded from the beginning the end of the economic help of the World-wide Bank and of the International Economic Bottom to diet of *Yakarta.
Now well, in the context of catastrophe that is *sucediendo there, Indonesian has happened to convert in a symbol of it a lot that diet without scruples, feeble and brutal is able to take to impose his can and control on #all the that, to trial, challenge authority.
How *sucede with the institutions of *Europa -the European Parliament, the European Union in group- that *nos prevents that we answer to the crisis of the world like villages, constituents, citizens wanted to that we answered?
The Security Council of the UN has adopted this morning the decision to send troops of pacification in an immediate future, and will allocate #some strengths of crash to the zone of urgent mood.
The deployment of the humanitarian help is urgent, and priorities are the protection of the deported to *Timor Western and access of the *ACNUR to the zone, #as well as the start of food distribution and utensils by aerial transport.
#would Be particularly interesting to listen the reactions of #París, *Berlín and *Madrid and of #many places #where has interpreted Colony decision like step more directed to implantation of a common defence.
How attitude has the Presidency #finnish concerning law preparation secretly, because in actuality the Council of Ministers do not has his the same more that in *Beijing and in *Corea of the North by it that refers to law approval on citizens secretly?
The international community has engaged to apply in whole the resolution 1244 adopted by the Security Council of the UN, by means of the *cual tries to create a *Kosovo democratic and multinational inside borders of the Republic of *Yugoslavia recognised internationally.
Gentleman president, believe that the answer of President in exercise and the debate on the previous question have contributed data on the selective way with that the called international community tackles the existent problems all over the world, among *ellos the situation that reigns in the *Balcanes.
Know that it is not necessary to convince to this Assembly, but like direct and main participant in the task of *paliar suffering and reconstruct normality and like coordinator of efforts of #others, the European Union has to assume the maximum possible responsibility.
Mrs. *Pack has shown especially *valerosa when ordering the disaster organised by the Council and has proposed a totally logical solution, is to say, establish the agency in *Pristina and *vincularla to the stability pact in *Tesalónica.
For *ello will stand out three looks: In the first place, for an alone dispatch do not take fault two organs of government; second, the taking of decisions has to produce #where make work or Agency of Reconstruction of *Kosovo; and in *tercer place, collaboration with the local population is important, and of form expresses cooperation *pluriétnica as it has stood out.
Logically, therefore, the agency has to have operation base there, although to hour to defend this option, am safe that nobody will forget the arguments so *persuasivos that Mr. *Cohn-*Bendit has presented in the debate of today on previous experiences.
Therefore the commission approved the need of a continuous and rigorous support to refugees and has accepted the *décimo Agreement *CE-*OOPS for the period 1999-2001, that has subjected to the *dictamen of the European Parliament and that represents a big contribution.
Gentleman President, this report has been approved by unanimity in Development Commission and Cooperation, and with tarpaulin, with the two amendments presented by Budget Commission so that all do not remain only in words, but that have a financial economic-plan.
For example, have taken fine note that #ours Assembly finishes to refuse the original editorial of section 6 of the resolution, that considered impossible to make the space of freedom, of security and of justice keeping the rule of unanimity in the Council.
The *socialdemócratas #danish in the European Parliament *nos have abstained in the vote of the resolution proposal relative to the increase of integration in the space of freedom, security and justice.
Besides, neither support the wish that the summit of *Tampere was the starting signal for the celebration of a new governmental conference on the increase of integration in the judicial field.
As it will know the Assembly, the financial situation general in *Rusia has reached a true stability from the spectacular fall of the rouble in the markets of international currencies in August of the past year.
Cover likewise, in opinion of the Commission, to the important exit of capital of *Rusia, that obviously has contributed to time to drop the level of international investment and has braked the economic growth.
In front of similar panorama, a timely measure of President *Yeltsin as it is approval of the proposal of #russian law on money bleaching #would reassure to the international community.
Likewise, as a result of the visit of the Presidency #finnish and of Commissioner go give *Broek to *Turquía on 26 August, is at present a financial package of 30 millions of euros to contribute to help activities and reconstruction in course.
Entrust in that support initiatives to short, half and long term will suppose a continuous help to the population of *Turquía and are safe that persons of #all the European Union will join to *nosotros in the wish that the arduous tasks of *restablecimiento of the communities and of morals succeed.
#The same reaffirm, finally, wish that dialogue continue only in measure in that it allow advance in the field of the human rights in country, so that, in particular, suspend the execution of convictions to death that have been pronounced.
Meanwhile, the international situation continues deteriorating and the reiterated international calls to the #burmese authorities so that they take measured directed to boost democracy, the human rights and reconciliation remain without a significant answer.
These activities #would owe likewise support the mixed military Commission attendant to organise the deployment of maintenance strength of peace and strength of *imposición of peace.
As well, in dispatch there #be not neither a window neither air taking and do not know #if photocopier, extremely noisy, produces hurtful broadcasts for health of person that commissions of #the same.
To take advantage of of an efficient way building, have to procure celebrate here in whole our session *plenaria, included Friday, so that afterwards have #all a week, in the that, #such as it has proposed #ours colleague, Mrs. *Ludford, #can *dedicarnos of way especially intense to #ours *circunscripciones electoral.
#Any one that know #which is the political activity of deputy, and reservation of #many of conversations and of performances, #can understand that #this is, possibly, the deepest defect and more structural and that, as it said Mrs. Speaker, possibly do not have solution.
My main request is that, as it needed change of the treaty for *traernos here in the first place, with security #can *presionar in our political parties, governments, to achieve change of the treaty that *nos move away to #all of here and spend money in *algo useful that persons #can appreciate.
#Any one that already have exposed to the use of new buildings, as it is my case, knows that it is necessary shooting time; inside six months, these details will have forgotten.
Equally, foresee that the beautiful carpets colour cream put in #some of stays of the commissions will be *irreversiblemente full of stains and dirty inside 3 months and will be unavailable, being an election of the colour poor and little practical and in last instance a waste of resources.
#If States members begin to act of mood, #can get to a situation in the that determined articles #would be forbidden in each Been member of the Community in different moments, and no will exist guarantee that it work properly the only market, by #whose creation and consolidation so much *nos have encouraged in Parliament.
Lady Speaker, gentleman President of the Commission, #if the *PPE did not wish that this debate took place in day of today was not by not to consider it important, but simply to be able to clear a series of things and *oir to a series of experts before pronouncing .
Has to follow contemplating consumer that withdrawal of agricultural earths in the EU, or was, renunciation to cultivate cereals, while they incinerate animal corpses and feeds to livestock with animal flours?
In the debate have to take into account -#this is important - #all the problems of agriculture and prevail quality agriculture, #as well as assign space to the question of relation among technical control and democratic control, aroused by Mrs. *Roth-*Behrendt.
The second is that, given the *prevalencia of AIDS in *África and knowing that thousands of youngsters cross the Mediterranean to go in, through *España or of countries, in *Europa, and taking into account also the incubation period of illness, that goes of six or seven years until twelve years, #can reckon that #one third part of youngsters is affected of AIDS and is in *Europa.
The third consideration in *pro of a favourable vote of this proposal is the relatively scarce quantity of help, that did not has to disturb the economic plans of the Commission.
Second, that, logically, will correspond to the budgetary authority, to *ustedes like Parliament, to the Commission in proposals and to the Council in decisions, take the decisions that estimate timely for the year 2000 without that, without embargo, in this moment prejudge #which is the definite solution.
Parliament aspires to that include in article 5 of program *ALTENER a reference to the new procedures for the exercise of competitions in matter of execution, so as to reinforce the participation of the European Parliament.
No suffices with seeing the figures, totally insufficient, that go to devote to the renewable energies, #would be necessary perhaps also devote a bit of time to examine the financial energies that devote to energy forms, in particular to the nuclear.
Together with program *SAVE, have in *ALTERNER *II form to show to the public of *Europa that there are rational forms to confront the challenge of the climatic change: energetic efficiency and sources of renewable energy.
In contrast with it that occurs in the great energetic companies, #where are hard-working, this fact means that #if we launch program and boost sources of alternative energy, at the same time will contribute also, like Europeans, to that employment politics receive greater attention.
Gentleman President, lady speaker, lady Commissioner, wanted to manifest my gratitude to the speaker, Mrs. *Ahern, by the dynamism with that has prepared program *plurianual 1998-2000 of promotion of the energetic efficiency *SAVE *II for the *segunda reading, continuing the work of the ancient speaker, Mrs. *Bloch *von *Blottnitz.
A greater energetic efficiency will involve, in the short term, lower consumption, the protection of the renewable energetic sources, a lower dependency of energy imports, #as well as a lower environmental pollution.
The Commission goes to present in brief -is included in diary of the next Council of 2 December- the action plan on energetic efficiency, and then will have occasion to argue more in depth these questions.
Already have swept the institutional racism and intolerance and prejudice legalised have been swept and now relation of the European Union with *Sudáfrica goes determined by recognition of attainment *transcendental.
have produced substantial advances in schooling of boys, in the medical service of vicinity, in access to the drinkable water and in electricity service but remains still a lot, a lot for taking.
Gentleman President, although we recognise that Trade Agreement, Development and Cooperation among the European Community, by part, and the Republic of *Sudáfrica, by #another, contains certainly valuable elements, share doubts of the speaker *Kinnock and have #some questions and suggestions for the Commission and the Council.

The European Union has 20 millions of unemployed and with 60 millions of poor and there #be not in the guidelines measure *vinculante directed to prevent dismissals and reduction plans of staff.
Consider that question turn constitutes an elementary parliamentary right that, in contrast with points of the agenda is guaranteed also on purpose in the Treaties, and, in consequence, wanted to insist in that question turn make in whole.
Gentleman President, *cuando the European Parliament in the autumn of 1998 agreed the continuation of the Program Car-*Oil, the calendar foresaw that the subject #would go back to Parliament to time to make possible a decision of the Council in the spring of 1999.
Personally, believe that the Council foresees in his common position #all a series of disposals very important as, for example, the reduction of values limit for carbon dioxide in a 30% in comparison with 1996 from October of the year 2000 or of the 2001.
Without embargo, #can accept the definition of the World-wide Organisation of Health, in the that says that health is not only the absence of illnesses, but a state of physical welfare, mental and social.
In January adopted a conjoint decision in the that established an action plan to promote the safest use of Internet and, therefore, to protect to boys of violence and of pornography.
The Commission, likewise, undertakes actions in the social and educational fields with the idea to improve quality of life of boys and the opportunities for development and education.
Are in an absurd situation in the that States members have to promote it that it is better for boys in legislation and in politics, but in the Union no exists a legal obligation to protect it that it was better for boys.
And while all #this *sucede in the world in roads of development, in Occident, purportedly civilised, violence, the abandonment and the sexual exploitation of boys, by means of the international networks, are hair-raising dimensions.
In session period of the past month, *usted, lady Commissioner, *calurosa and convincingly affirmed that it is will of the Commission strengthen the rights of employees regarding information and query on destination.
Finally, Gentleman President, the Commission of Budgetary Control thinks that *nosotros also to half of term have to go back to study a new system of own resources, because #if it goes to have more countries the current system #can result too much complicated.
The agreements of *Berlín are a combination among the total level and the composition of cost, the political reforms and the system of own resources.
In *Berlín, admit, in effect, the principle according to the *cual #some rich countries, the of the north of the Union, paid too much, of there a new weighting of the proportional parts of finance of States members that will have like consequence a greater participation of *Francia by quantity of order of varied thousands of millions of frank.
Only a new approach of the question of the own resources, that do not increase the fiscal charge borne by the taxpayers and that go back more transparent, simple and rational the system #can give conditions of affirmation to the European Union.
The only real justification of aberration is to recess the #dutch bill, although the balance -to use terminology of the Council- goes inflated in favour of arks *bátavas by the effect *Rotterdam.
*Acaso thinks that we #can continue long with tax *conributiva so limited *cuando the European Union purchases every time a greater number of responsibilities related with the *prolongamiento of the monetary union, enlargement of the Union, the take into account the foreign political responsibilities and of security?
In practice, this ceiling depends of the agreement among organs, that results clearly inferior to the of cost politics of agriculture #This is another clear indication of the parliamentary responsibility in relation to the budgets.
With regard to the *PRS 5 *permítanme that *me direct also to the Commission for *decirle that of course knew that we were a new Parliament and in spite of *ello presented in the summer holidays a supplementary budget *cuando were not at all in situation to react because the new Parliament was not still operative.
In consequence, the committee of the Commission commissioned of the nomination has made a selection and *les #can ensure that today *les will deliver in the course of day candidate list that has been elaborated by this last committee.
*Me allow to observe that it is a budgetary political reality that in the course of an exercise, of the execution of a budget, arise events that do not allow a total utilisation of #all the budgetary lines.
Want to retort to Mrs. *Dührkop *Dührkop that, of course, the priorities that Parliament determine in the budgetary procedure and for the budget in #if, are scales that has to follow the Commission when acting in the frame of the execution of the budget.
My parliamentary Group takes a call to the Commission and to States members so that they introduce said tax of form coordinated so that no have disloyal competition inside the Union; tax, of course, do not has to *repercutir in citizens.
#can not *hacernos charge of the nuclear waste, in spite of that have proposed diverse imaginative solutions, included the of *enviarlos to the Moon, and the truth is that, #if we suited with Mr. *Chichester in that the nuclear energy is a solution, #would be in another planet.
The communication of the Commission on the strengthening of the environmental integration in the community energetic politics is very #worthy of *beneplácito, given his realistic approach of the question.
#This supposes -taking into account the point of environmental sight in his owed form- that States members prepare his own national strategies -since it is a question of decisions of national type- with sufficient time for the replacement and *recolocación of investments.
*Yo was not favourable to the approval of the amendments subjected to the vote of our Assembly, that had delayed the entrance in vigour of this text and, therefore, the set up of investments and the industrial strategies.
My Group will go back to present amendments that presented in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market to try advance more still, so that the systems that go to establish result more accessible and opened for professionals.
The own speakers check differences so marked in matter of right of persons among States members, it that explains the strong reservations formulated in the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens.
point: to me also *me has got this study of the Institute for Risk Analysis of the Senate of university of *Viena that analyses the question of *Yaslovske *Bohunice under a different perspective.
Only *Europa and, gentleman Commissioner, *le appreciate that it have comprised it, only #one *Europa joined #can go to meeting, no only of the countries that ask to go in in the European Community, but also of #all #that that have of nuclear facilities no satisfied with security norms for *ayudarles to resolve the problem taking into account his own imperative economic.
*Usted has indicated with reason that owe *tomarnos seriously the scientific considerations and childbirth of the fact that graziers #british are interested in selling it more quickly possible a safe meat and not expecting two years until they #can take it.
Believe that His *Señoría #would consider wise on our part have taken part in evaluation mission of the World-wide Bank and expect to that civil servants, that have taken part in said mission of evaluation, present reports before resorting to the budgetary authorities for *pedirles concrete quantities of bottoms.
Of mood, company "*Mitilinaios *S.To.", with upper investments to 52 millions of dollars in mines "*RMHK *TREPCA", face up to objections and difficulties and suffer pressures, with the last purpose to cancel his contractual and real rights in mines quoted.
The *KFOR is all it possible in circumstances extraordinarily difficult and deserves #all support to try, for example, watch by that no have a repetition of the type of atrocity against edicts that, by misfortune, has *desbaratado life in *Kosovo in the past.
Exist diverse modalities of finance in the national levels and of the EU -#such as the structural Bottoms and the *agromedioambientales- and #can use to help in the reconversion and in the management of his social repercussions during a transitory period.
The report of the EU will exert an important influence in development of the sources of regional resources, and thus it #can not arise split among the old and the new programs.
Simply want to say that in these cases, will show pragmatism to be able to adapt, according to demands of the national authorities, programming of the Goal 1 or of the Goal 2 to help to these countries to reconstruct .
How is had to take so that the countries that do not contemplate in legislations the prohibition to exert violence against women in breast of home also have norms?
#One of the essential elements of the communication of the Commission is precisely ratification by #all States members of the Agreement of the Council of *Europa of 1983 and #can inform to His *Señoría that the quoted agreement was ratified by *Alemania, *Dinamarca, *Finlandia, *Francia, *Luxemburgo, the Low Countries, Realm Joined and *Suecia.
But no only #this #would be necessary, but also promote dialogue with the main actors, no only aerial companies and users, but also with the aerial controllers and #all airports, etc. Is to say, #all actors that take part inside this complex world of the aerial traffic.
Monday, in the Council of General Subjects, ministers left very clear that had political will to decide in *Helsinki on #which has to be the collective military capacity of *Europa for the missions of *Petersberg.
Is evident that the Commission is not fan school to bosses of personnel and is evident that want to work by hit with the High Representative and with Parliament to guarantee that *Europa has security politics and of defence that needs and that citizens want.
Since it has referred at length to responsibility like High Representative for the External Politics, #would want to mention look that believe that it is important: our external politics and of common security will be, fundamentally, projection and development of our inner strength.
Equally, do not extract like only lesson of this terrible experience the requirement to be able to range more troops, to be able to increase our military costs and to advance by forced marches to the *Europa of defence, besides, in the frame of NATO.
Thus I request to the Commission that inform to Parliament with character of urgency on conversations relative to Chinese adhesion and, in particular, of how #this #can affect to our *preparativos bear *Seattle, so that Parliament #can vote tomorrow the report of Mr. *Schwaiger with full knowledge of #all the notable data.
Therefore, repeat, #if the regulation of the world-wide trade is means of life of persons and damaging the environment or the protection of animals, have to modify the regulation.

Gentleman President, gentleman Representative of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, so much my colleagues like *yo same have received with relief the day before yesterday the statement of the Council of External Subjects of the Union that condemns *vigorosamente the disproportionate use and *indiscriminado that takes of strength in *Chechenia.
Also were #many the that regret, with a majority of the #european public opinion, the contrast *sobrecogedor among the *estruendo of bombardments and the prolonged silence of the governments of the European Union.
In spite of his own moral ballast, the European Union has to act with #all strengths so that it get to a solution of the crisis of *Chechenia following guidelines that the Council and the Commission have exposed here.
The European Union asks a negotiated and -joyous exit #that that believes in the possibility of negotiation- while in the *Cáucaso the Russians distinguish among bandits -#that that ask the independence- *cargándoles perhaps of the #islamic colours, and the fine, or was, the that collaborate with *ellos.
In reality, neither has been free trade, since the International Monetary Bottom has endorsed the risks taken by the North American investors and *les has compensated the losses that has originated the free trade of capitals.
deputies to the European Parliament of the Communist Party of #Grecia will vote against of the Report *Schwaiger, because it ranges with aggression plans of the big capital against workers and villages of #everyone.
#There is other international treaties, like the celebrated in the frame of the World-wide Organisation of Work, of the World-wide Organisation of the Intellectual Property and of the agreements *multilaterales in matter of environment.
And, from sight point, gentleman President, and to finish, wanted to offer #all support and collaboration to Commissioner *Lamy in the purpose and the points of strategic sight that has very present for *defenderlos in *Seattle.
Without embargo, with the approval of the Report *Schwaiger, Parliament will decide and will declare tomorrow that the concept of the protection of the environment has to take in consideration in #all the fields of the world-wide trade, no with an ambiguous disposal, with a "#can" or a "#would have to" , but with "owe" imperative.
The sum of #all elements *nos carries to recommend negotiation cycle wider - and *me cheer of the enormous coincidence of points of sight in this sense among the Commission and Parliament #such as it deduces, gentleman *Schwaiger, of report.
In any case have the mandate to admit, in the frame of an international negotiation, the *cuestionamiento of power of the Governments of the Union to regulate or act in these fields.
. (OF) Gentleman President, the Commission of Constitutional Subjects debated thoroughly this report during varied sessions and *yo believe that today we present to Plenary a report with a substantial content with seen to reform of the Treaties.
In the first place, request reform of #all the institutions and organs, included, therefore, the Court of Justice, the Court of Accounts, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
In this sense, request that President of the Commission #can interpose the question of confidence in front of the European Parliament and that incorporate to the next Treated the called "procedure *Prodi" , or was, the possibility that President #can *destituir to commissioner.
Specifically, ask that it reinforce paper of Parliament and establish the principle of the vote by majority in the Council in #some fields in the that the Treaties already assign a key paper to *Europa, *salvaguardando fully subsidiariness principle.
#This will exert an important paper in the *preparativos of the Conference *Intergubernamental, and have to say that backrest with taste the general goals fixed in this report on the construction of a more effective Union, more transparent and more democratic.
But #everything *ello, gentleman President in exercise of the Council, taking into account an essential thing: not losing of sight it that have meant the European Communities in these years neither it that it is more important in the Communities, that is the principle of integration.
Gentleman President, #this *CIG will have support of two parallel processes: "the happy world" of a new politics of #european defence and the definition of the #european citizenship in the preparation of the Letter.
Never will accept that the executive power in the EU was now for another governmental conference #whose core was transfer of power of the constituents and of representatives to enclosed offices in *Bruselas.
The *segunda amends analyses the subject that the Treaty state of two parts: the constitutional part, that analyses the fundamental principles and the institutional disposals, and the small letter that treats on politics.
To succeed, the institutional reforms have to situate , *me seems to me -and say it with experience that conserve in the memory of the previous negotiation- in a political perspective wider and try answer joints to this fundamental question: "How will have to *hablarnos?
In the first place, the institutional reforms #such as they planned in Colony: the composition of the Commission, Commissioner by Been member in it that to *nosotros refers; the weighting of the votes, that has to save proportion with the number of inhabitants; and the votes by qualified majority.
The third question is that we have to establish a fine legal base in the new Treaty for the adoption of a #european regulation relative to the opening of the administration and to transparency.
Want to say here that reform a treaty in name of efficiency *me seems operation of very *poca ambition in front of the #european project and fear that so only was a simple game of power to allow that a small group of countries #can constitute in directory and conduct and direct the #european project.
Besides, has presented appeal with arrangement to article 112 of Regulation, that remits to article 60, *cuando results that the report of Mr. *Napolitano, as it says very clearly in the *considerandos of said report, remits to article 181, because *versa on the inner Regulation of Parliament.
Besides, in consideration to the national penal right, efforts for *uniformar the common definitions, the foundations to dictate cars of processing and penalties, have to limit in a first stage to #some sectors determined of special importance, #such as the illicit market of drugs.
Is to say, that no treats to fix in concrete a start of negotiations, but to ratify the quality of candidate to adhesion and to consider measures to take in consequence.
#Can indicate the Council #if these restrictions imposed by *Turquía are compatible with the principles of the European Union and #if it accepts that the interests of fuselages with pavilion of States members of the Union result prejudiced by a country that aspires to integrate in #the same?
*Me ask also why the European Union shows so *tolerante with infringements committed by *Turquía, and accepts that the interests of the Marine *Mercante #european are *lesionados by a country that do not hesitates in looming even to the *superpotencia, States Joined, to defend trade of banana.
The *segunda observation, and question to time, that want to direct to gentleman representative of the Council is the following: to diet of *Milosevic do not recognises it the European Union; says, before even that the own political strengths of *Yugoslavia, of Serbian, pronounce to the *respecto, that just elections #can not celebrate .
efforts deployed to reduce money bleaching have to intensify by means of the fast adoption and subsequent application of the amendment recently proposed for the directive on money bleaching.
By #everything it aforesaid entrust in that have the potential and #can have of the political will to face up to the new challenges in the perspective of the strategy of the European Union in matter of fight against drug for the years 2000 to 2004.
#If we vote on the original text of section, #if we finish the vote on the amendment, in moment will propose that it vote on the words "*and *socially-*balanced" of the #english text by separate of the rest of the text.
From now on *me #would enjoy to ask to Group that took favour to verify how many deputies #can present to individual title amendments in session *plenaria; 15 different deputies of the *PPE have presented amendments of this report, suppose that in name of the Group, before wasting time in the session *plenaria.
In the current situation, have opted for voting in favour of the whole of the report in the final vote, since vote against #can interpret like that we do not want that it regulate the fight against fraud.

Finally, gentleman President, our intention is the that the Commission and the Council #can take correspond to convictions and to the political speeches the suitable financial expression and technical of support to the process of independence and reconstruction of *Timor Oriental.
Therefore, *me seems that the proposal of the Council in front of Nations Joined, by important and positive that it was the initiative, is truly shy because it appeals *textualmente to that States that still keep death pity -quote *textualmente- "restrict progressively the number of crimes for the that it imposes" .
Another problem is that the #albanian leaders or the that believe to be it are not able to build jointly a future for this country, for homeland. Therefore, is important that also take a call to the supposed leaders.
Therefore, is indispensable that the mission of the EU in *Moscú at least examine this case. But also is important that take part in dialogue from a point of political sight, that recognise character merely politician of the process and that #Alexander *Nikitin was put in freedom.

Therefore, gentleman President, east is bottom curtain of the report that tomorrow will be voted in Plenary of Parliament and to the that, like speaker, have presented two amendments that justify with it that have explained on the elections in *Luxemburgo and with the words that have pronounced.
Wanted to *recordarles, so much to the Commission as to the Council, a beautiful sentence of jurist #german of the past century. #This said that the legislator has to think like philosopher and talk like peasant, simple and clearly and comprehensible for persons.
But without forgetting that modifications constitute explanation in mood *ociosa -and has reason Mr. *Rothley-, because a directive in any case #can affect to the international Right deprived neither to procedure rules.
#If to #this add an international dimension in the that the victims find in a foreign country, the problems #can multiply : languages and different procedures, inability to identify or locate to third, by not talking of formalities with the insurance companies.
Have to remember that this number is very small, *equivale to two daily trips for country, and that the sum of #all permissions of automatic attribution along the five years do not reaches at least the 7% of the total.
To *través of #the same the European Union establishes forms and terms for the progressive elimination of substances that exhaust ozone coat and *le ensure that no *subestimo at all dangerousness of the current situation.
*Ello nevertheless, the report of Mrs. *Hulthén goes back to propose the amendments that were not approved shortening indiscriminately the calendar for the prohibitions of production, commercialisation and the use of the distinct substances.
In actuality is indispensable labeling by two reasons, first because they do not know exactly the dangers for the public health that proceed of alimentary products produced from *OGM or derivatives and consistently is reasonable to follow of wall path in the market.
Of mood, invites to the Commission to that it prepare a proposal on a long-term basis that it integrate closely politics for the sustainable development from the point of economic sight, social and ecological, the *cual will have to present to the European Council in June of the 2002.
Has been première in style, because it has been able, in a historical moment, loaded of signs, of face to the new #millenium, to aim a creative perspective for the European Union in front of the challenges to the that it confronts.
My Group, by mediation of this Assembly, will work together with deputies and together with the Commission to try convince to the next #portuguese Presidency so that it was more ambitious in reform, without thus leave to respect the calendar.
Have to expect that it have village that *atreva to say no to the penultimate treaty before the Constitution and believes crop broth so that the unification and centralism are substituted by the *Europa of democracies and of diversity.
Among disappointments find again some important questions from sight point of development of the internal market and of taking system of decisions of the Union.
Regarding the question of #if they will attend here Defence Ministers, neither #can answer negatively, but it is necessary to take into account that the Council of General Subjects commissions of these questions and, #if it is necessary, will take part in #the same Defence Ministers.
And *nosotros know that #that is the essential problem, because it is a problem related with nature of the European Parliament, because no treats of Parliament that work with the normal constitutional systems of countries.
To opinion, the best alternative is road differentiated: cooperation in matter of security, development of the Union *Aduanera, permanent political dialogue, instead of *promulgar candidate statute to adhesion that in last instance *carece of value and that will contribute rather to create problems that to solution.
The decisions of *Helsinki are of a big transcendence for the future of the Union, specifically, the decisions on the strategy for enlargement, on the Conference *Intergubernamental and on the External Politics and of Common Security.
will fund new programs: in the agricultural sector, of help for infrastructures and in the fields of transport and the protection of the environment. #This will allow to pipe to States candidates by the path of approximation to the Union in important looks.
Said #this, *yo want to manifest my gratitude to the speakers, Gentlemen *Bourlanges, *Virrankoski and *Colom -although report do not debate today-, and especially also to president and to members of Budget Commission by the intense work that have developed during the last months.
The budgetary games for the Environment Commission refer in general to quantities very small, but *nos have allowed to initiate the preparatory investigation that *nos will help to formulate the question of competition in matter of health according to the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
President Roman *Prodi has expressed the position of the Commission on interpretation of the decisions of *Helsinki today in the morning here, in front of Plenary, and to this statement remit regarding the position of the Commission.
Gentleman President, in audition of Commissioner Mr. *Vitorino, *le said that had joy to see that it was the only Commissioner that had concerned to talk of education like *algo important to incorporate to the *tercer *pilar.
In opinion of the Commission, the Letter that will present to State Bosses and of Government has to contribute an authentic value added and the better form to reach it is to centre in the resultant fundamental rights of the own Union.
#This do not involves that the rail transport do not have advantages in the long distances, since, with security, - and *eso also concerns a lot to Mr. *Messner - surroundings, the environment, suffers less damage.
The current committee of work has shown to be an important forum for the debate and for information exchange and experiences on quality politics among States members and the countries candidates.
Create -after investigation carried out during 18 months by newspaper of Realm Joined, as a result of investigation of the Commission- that time constrains and the car industry want to now find a solution for this question.
By part, kept attitude too much *vacilante in relation with the formal statement of the Agreement *Interinstitucional and contracted international commitments of character *plurianual, but instead in a *primer moment manifested the intention to resolve only, like a *primer step, finance problem for the year 2000.
Therefore, *nos have pronounced in favour of a reasonable review of the financial perspectives for varied years, and the proposal of our general speaker, gentleman *Bourlanges, that asked a review like this for chapter 4, went in the correct direction.
Therefore, #would have to initiate serious negotiations in the budgetary look and the Council #can congratulate that the European Parliament was to the height of responsibilities in relation with these budgetary subjects and also there #be *politizado in look.
The *margen financial necessary for *ello #can establish in the frame of the decisions of the European Union, specifically conceding greater importance to the exhaustion of the maximum limit of the own resources in function of the gross inner product.
The sense of rejection to vote the Report *Bourlanges is to time the to report character limited and *irrisorio of help considered, but also and especially report politics of the western powers in the *Balcanes.
The Commission values efforts made by Parliament and in particular by the speaker and by Budget Commission, and also efforts that has made the Presidency #finnish of the Council.
#All the future challenges -enlargement, competitiveness in the international transactions, level *persistentemente high of unemployment- are related with the financial subject. The Court of Accounts #can modify, besides, his committed in look.
Therefore, keeps in foot the call to States members so that they also designate women for this task, as sure that among so much even in *Europa will have run the voice that women know of accounts; value to signal deficiencies have had it always.
paper of the Court of Accounts consists in examining #all income and costs to see #if costs have been legal and normal and #if the financial management has been serious.
Finally, *me #would enjoy to ask to the representative of the European Commission, so much with regard to this last point mentioned as to the report in general, #if it goes to have really in account the recommendations formulated in the frame of query, time approved by Parliament.
In previous years, *me have seen forced to ascertain, to the equal that #many other active colleagues in *Europa Oriental, that utilisation of bottoms of the EU in the frame of *TACIS no always was the most effective.
Gentleman *Valdivielso -expect that it treat of misunderstanding because of error of translation-, *yo believe that continuity of project *TACIS in favour of democracy is very important precisely in *Rusia and that it is precise to select with care the fields in the that sure enough it #would have to suspend program *TACIS.
In *tercer place, in my opinion, help #would have to direct , in greater measure that until today -and am now, for example, in the granting of money, that has *carecido of a clear direction and of control during long time-, instead of to *Moscú, to the common citizen, to the most disadvantaged Russians.
And finish underlining that the *dictamen satisfied on this recommendation will allow to the European Community adhere fully to the Parallel Agreement and confirm leader position in harmonisation and in enlargement politics of the markets.
Also *nosotros coincide with the Council in the sense to tend bridges to the countries in development. But tend bridges to the countries in development means two things: not trying trade with *ellos purchase-sale of quotas and no *recortar neither development bottoms and of help so that they #can take measures in the direction that *nosotros pose.
The question of the climatic changes and the corresponding apocalyptic visions are a forceful way, world-wide, to call attention on the dangers of pollution.

*Yo do not want to take part, by means of the approval of a proposal of community taxes on energy, in implantation of a principle that limit sovereignty of States members in fiscal matter.
The behaviour of each #one of *nosotros, consumers, has consequences in the climate, and the energetic tax, tax on carbon dioxide, is method so that price convert in ecological label.
*Nos concerns can express our opinion *cuando believe that they are measures that loom continuity of right State; and #would not be faithful to the promises that have taken to the population of *Macao and *Hong *Kong, #would not be loyal to values, #if we do not protest *cuando *nos seem that said values see loomed.
#Can accept in principle the *segunda splits of the amendment 12, on condition that term fix in 30 June 2002, and the amendment 15, on condition that the date for the prohibition of the use of *hidroclorofluorocarburos virgin fix in 2008 and that the prohibition of the use *hidroclorofluorocarburos recycled fix in 2010.

The European Union has to represent engine paper in the future discussions. In effect, as it has seen very well, the European Union has known to impose like an indispensable intermediary among States Joined and the *PVD.
The competent commission has to appoint a speaker, the speaker has to elaborate a report, and the modification, #if it accepts, has to be approved by a qualified majority of our Assembly, majority that comprises more of half of members.
Even here in the European Parliament has said that exists the general goal to boost equality of opportunities for men and women in #all the political programs and in #all the political sectors.
#can make, besides, an exhaustive balance of means that *Europa, as #such, endows from takes varied decades to build sex equality, especially in matter of compatibility among the familiar and professional life, #as well as to combat maltreatments that suffer women?
But, nevertheless, want to underline, as already they have taken it #some orators, that fulfillment of commitments of the platform of *Beijing forces mainly to states members, forces mainly to the governments. The horizontal strategy of the European Union finds in second flat.
Last night, as I create, the Agriculture Council no only adopted a position on the resolution of the Report *Papayannakis, that results *algo precipitated, but that besides, create, modified the juridical foundation of the text on the that Mr. *Papayannakis elaborated report.
The effects of *Seatlle also have weighed in this decision, by the fact of *privilegiar the principle of caution and prevail health of citizens before that the rules of the market.

#All parts #would have to collaborate in a #inspired environment in confidence and abstain to undertake actions that #can put in danger a solution of the problem of the *Sáhara Western based in respect of the human rights and of democracy.
Besides, the Presidency #finnish took a statement on 21 June 1999, in the *cual reiterated support of the EU to the peace plan of the UN and to actions related with #the same.
Besides, efficiency of work of the Council #would see affected notably, #if the meetings of the Council left to celebrate during a week to month and, therefore, it was necessary *insertarlas even more tightly in the remaining weeks.
Eight hours, as aptly it has said Speaker in exercise of the Council, #would have to be the maximum limit allowed in #all the European Union for the transport of animals alive.
But go to create frame of legitimate practices; try to fix rules for a healthy competition, of mood that each, in accordance with possibilities and faculties, #can advance to the future with the best perspective.
do not believe that the amendment *nº 18, relative to the obligation of debtors to deliver change letter in the case of long periods of contractual payment have possibility to be accepted by the Council.
But in name of the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to that *nos cleared -as it is not present the Council #would appreciate that it took it Commissioner *Byrne before initiating the debate- how have to interpret the statements and the conclusions of the Council that have in front.
5) The Council has examined work document prepared by services of the Commission to the *respecto -14015\/99- and has taken note of the existence of a big majority in favour of bottom of the text;
*Les call attention, to be precise, on the fact that the optional diet of country, or of countries, do not converts like this without more in the compulsory general diet of #all the Union.
Is a state of things absolutely scandalous that are here seated in a parliamentary Assembly with the ninety percent of his empty seats, a week before Christmas, examining a regulation that nobody knows how and when will go in in vigour, with a Council that *nos is with contempt.
Regrettable only has taken in #one #few countries, whereas in countries is *muchísimo set up this decision. In these countries not even has begun to build labeling system.
Likewise are behaviour of the Council and the behaviour and posture of the Commission. For labeling of meat of *vacuno the Commission *nos has presented two proposals.
Is regrettable that the debates on these so complex and important questions have had to celebrate in the frame of an urgent decision with an almost impossible term to fulfil.
Obviously, the use of *BST #can cause change of habits of consumers. In this way, the existent disequilibrium in the sectors of milk and the dairy products and meat of *vacuno #would finish aggravating even more.
In this sense follow entrusting in support of *Europa, support that go directed to the preparation of the *timorenses, with the exact understanding of the universal values, not to betray, in last instance, suffering of village.

No to the Commission, undoubtedly, #such as it showed it in *Seattle, neither to the Council, that in *segunda reading takes cut *funesto of 450 millions of euros in the compulsory costs, neither -alas- to Parliament, that, by means of speaker, pretends to question the existence of the compulsory costs.
The simple fact, gentleman President, gentleman Commissioner, that *me direct to *ustedes in #german tongue shows that the fixed price of book do not constitutes a problem of field exclusively national, but type subject *transfronteriza that affects also to diverse linguistic islands, in addition to to *Alemania and to *Austria.
In resolution proposal, my Group underlines that books are first of all cultural sakes, and do not have to, as, subject to competition norms of form that the rest of commodities.
Already indicated that, regarding the specific case *alemano-#austrian that it is object of a procedure, alas, #can not go in in details; without embargo, *les #can guarantee that during the first three months of my mandate *me have employed in depth in *reunirme with parts and in looking for possibilities of a positive solution.
Remain here equally comprised the elimination of corruption, the solution of the social problems linked to the #asian economic crisis and the need of *relanzar the national economy, seriously *quebrantada.
In this moment, two citizens of the EU expect the execution of death pity: Spanish in the *Yemen and Italian in the #EE.UU. This last, Mr. *Barnabei, will be executed in the year 2000.

#can not *asociarnos to protest against arrest conditions of the political prisoners in *Djibouti but affirming clearly that, #if well the *carceleros are in country, the true responsible find in #some of the official palaces of the French Republic.
In the last months, has carried out by part of the Government a systematic weakening of the *Contraloría General, weakening process culminated in a pact that celebrated the Government with an ancient party of the Government.
As we already have heard, in this moment do not have to *preocuparnos by health of gentleman *Jarquín, but will observe with attention that receives a suitable deal, and *nos concern especially informations according to the *cual family in particular daughter has been assaulted physically.
But it that it is absolutely unquestionable for any impartial observer is that here it that has wanted to take is to avert precisely investigation of corruption with the collusion, besides, of the *sandinistas and to remove of in half to the one who went to be the boss of the opposition in the Republic of *Nicaragua.
*Permítanme that on the subject of women in *Kuwait say in brief that the Commission, to the equal that deputies to the European Parliament, is very disappointed by the result of the votes of 30 November in said country.
The Commission has followed with big worry the course of events that have conducted to the arrest and imprisonment of the *Contralor General of *Nicaragua, gentleman *Jarquín. *Nos have joined to the initiative to east concerning the *troica of the European Union, of 18 November.
Besides, States members of the Union and the European Commission have adopted and supported a series of additional initiatives for the promotion of ratification of the statute.
So much in plane of the private sakes and of the public sakes in matter of dramas and heavy infrastructures as in plane of the economic instrument, the needs are enormous: of order of six *millardos of frank French, as it has remembered.
Already know that from takes years no longer exists a budgetary line in the budgets of the European Community allocated to confront the natural catastrophes that produce in the countries of the Union.
Are in accordance with the procedure, although it is true that #would have been much better #if we had had the opportunity of *debatirlas in the commission and, as it said at the beginning of the week, *ello #would have constituted an optimum opportunity to argue the subject.
Therefore, has to be *prioritario for the institutions put means so that data are increasingly complete, more reliable and faster, by it that the agricultural statistics have to be increasingly flexible, more harmonic, more merged with the #others statistical fields with possibility to incorporate new sources.
This file has history and, in reality, today, it that *les propose is to conclude file that opened in 1991 on loan of 1 *millardo 200 millions of euros to the new independent States, in moment of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
*Tayikistán is sure enough the poorest country of the new independent States, that has to stabilise totally, since a bit to the equal that *Chechenia and by reasons, is a country that #can put in danger to #all the region, mainly by his strategic position regarding *Kazajstán and to *Uzbekistán that they are countries very rich.
reasons are the following: the financial contribution of the community will continue being high in a region #whose stability has worsened, so much by the #russian financial crisis as by the current situation in the north of the *Cáucaso.
Gentleman President, ignore #if it treats of a technical correction but finish to discover that I do not appear among deputies *luxemburgueses in Record of Wednesday, relative to the report of Mrs. Palace *Vallelersundi on verification of powers.
article 158 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, that constitutes the base of cohesion politics, has suffered an erroneous translation in #any of the official tongues of the Union.
The EU goes to pose also in the future to the #sudanese Government questions of human rights with the purpose to reach of said Government a change of attitude also regarding slavery.
The EU is of the opinion that dialogue among Indian and *Pakistán is the key for the solution of Cashmere conflict, that taxes especially relations among countries.
do not go to tackle here, with #all the depth that #would deserve the case, the problem of *Gibraltar, that is colony of a Been member inside another Been member partner of the European Union, which is an anachronism in the threshold of the century *XXI.
Gentleman President, the resolution on the improvement of the institutions without modifying the Treaties constitutes #one of elements contributed by Parliament to instrument the European Union for the future.
Like this things, the mental reservations, distrusts and tendency to enclose #can increase, in place to diminish, and *influenciar conflicts among the parties and the political representatives creating some *disgregación and *algo of insecurity.
Have treated to work like speaker in this sense and, to said end, *me were very useful works of the Commission of External Subjects, Security and Political of Defence, #as well as the amendments presented.
By it that refers to the particular case of Malt, *me *congratulo of the recommendation of the Commission according to the *cual the critical examination of the #maltese legislation #would have to begin immediately, so that negotiations with country #can initiate before the end of this year.
Only #can reach progresses limited in relation to the process of general adaptation and to the execution of priorities in the short term relative to collaboration for integration.
Regarding *Hungría #can be very brief: Important progresses in #some areas, especially thanks to the approval of a package of general reforms for the administration of justice, #as well as to the conclusion of the structural economic reforms.
Without embargo, in #some areas, like the of the protection of the environment, the process of legislative harmonisation is rather slowly, and also planning of the regional development finds still in his initial stage.
Likewise, goes recognising increasingly the risk that the agreements, #if well companies fulfil with the juridical conditions to be able to receive to exemption by category, in the practical finish *surtiendo effects of *falseamiento of competition #if they sign among companies with a strong position in the market.
In *tercer place, have a question on transition period for the agreements in course; *me ask #if the agreements signed under the current diet will be able to execute entirely under this current diet or #if *les will apply the new diet, in #whose case pray that it indicate from when.
. Gentleman President, *Señorías, in the first place, want to congratulate to Defender of Village and to services by transparency and rapidity with that have *rendido explain on activities, no only in front of Parliament and Request Commission, but directly to citizens and associations of States members.
request right #can exert it #all residents of the European Union -and no only citizens of the Union- #as well as the organisations based in the European Union.
*Yo *me incorporated to Parliament in March of this same year and from then no have left of be member of said commission. *Ello *me has allowed to observe of wall until how point Mr. *Newman has encouraged by the well of citizens.
Is, without embargo, it that *sucede in this case. Of the annual report of Defender of the #european Village for 1998 gives off that institution appears among the most operative and the most efficient of the European Union.
#There is a deep international ignorance about family right and about it that *sucede #if marriage undoes and boys have to go to live to a country that is not the of his usual residence.
Wanted to propose to Plenary that, given hour, immediately after the report of Mr. *Valverde, advanced in the vote on *Kosovo, to express the position of Parliament on this subject so important.
deputies to the European Parliament of the *PASOK represent a country that suffers directly the consequences of war and that, from the *primer moment, has loaned help in drama of the *albanokosovares that have seen forced to abandon homes.
A safe public opinion that it only will have attacks of rockets and by aviation -but no participation of military strengths of fight that #can have drops in terrain- #can support by *algún time bombardments, in name of conviction of the unfair and abominable diet of *Milosevic and of barbarism against #Kosovar.
Have wanted that it reigned the right in the international society and today consent, of way more *humillante, an abuse of North American authority, without that it mediate any mandate of the UN.
has wanted to invent the principle of the selective humanitarian interference, because it punishes to *Milosevic by the ethnic cleansing, but ignores the problem *kurdo in *Turquía and opens *inquietantes stages for the hot zones of *Europa: *Córcega, *Irlanda and the Basque Country in *España.
intervention in war, under control of NATO, do not translates, as, an absence of #european politics, but an erroneous #european politics.
This political error inscribes inside a logic that traces back to the option that the following day to the fall of the Wall of *Berlín effected #all a generation of leaders and of #european managers.
For example, the amount of the *gravámenes on vehicles #can vary in 3.000 euros to the year, exist nine distinct varieties of rates for transports by railway and coverage grade of the costs #can oscillate among a 0 and a 100 %.
Am convinced that in this community normative stage the approach differentiated will be more effective and besides will respect totally the legitimate papers of the normative sectors of transport in other political planes.
#All know that this sphere, the question of rates by road use, of lines *férreas, of aerial lines or of maritime lines, is *plagada of obstacles and that progress, especially in the political plane, #can be of a slowness *penosa.
Besides, the Council has not accessed to the request of Parliament to foresee fiscal advantages with idea to boost the moods of alternative transport.
Is known that entities of traditional credit are, already of by yes, authorised to issue electronic money, in application of the group of the banking directives, and by this new service #can cost of the #european passport.
Also is possible that this logic base, simply, in the easy #obtaining of benefits, in place to take into account service character of general interest that #would have to have the banks, for #all a series of consumers.
Create, as, that gather conditions to continue work, and #if *me allows to express a personal wish, #this consists in that Mr. *Prodi integrate to Mr. *Monti in his new squad; *ello #would not take more that benefit so much to the Commission as to Parliament.
Without embargo, is not possible to create by law an only financial area to the by minor in that the basic banking transactions are economic and effective, #such as it occurs in the national systems, although performance frame shows how #can carry forward this process.
#This *nos forces to reiterate that, regarding transport system, the election *prioritaria of the European Union has to be the to move big part of the heavy traffic of road to the railway.
In particular, after the closing of the tunnel, are reservation cancellations *hoteleras in Valley of *Aosta. Therefore, exists also an economic look, related with tourism, extremely important for this region, that will have to be taken in account.
In it that to the consequences of the closing of the tunnel of the *Mont *Blanc refers, the Commission will employ #all means inside the field of his limited competitions to procure that development of traffic do not see seriously altered.
The truth is that *Birmania possesses supports very important, in particular -and regret the absence of Commissioner *Brittan- *Birmania is firmly supported by Chinese, so much in the economic plane as in soldier, and *eso is it that *le allows to follow repressing and preventing any type of democratic development.
Is true that Mr. Go of *Broek, that do not has attributions in the field of Competition Politics, #can not but read *aquello that services of the Commission, is to say, services of Mr. Go *Miert, *le had noted.
After debating a report of speaker on politics of the European Union in May of 1998, approve a resolution on the improvement of the operation of the #european institutions.
actuality *nos remembers day the political lagoons of the #european construction and the inability of the Union to face up by himself\/hisself same to the majority of the great challenges that *le present.
Expect that the government occupy that information campaign programmed was plural of form that inform so much on the advantages as on problems of adhesion and that information was available freely for #all Malt citizens.
cooperation is likewise #one of the master keys that characterise relations among Request Commission of the European Parliament and Defender of the #european Village.
Without embargo, the speaker goes too much far when demanding that it also include in the system of *tarificación transport deprived no commercial in car, in name of a just cast of the costs among #all users of infrastructure of roads.
In this context #would have been interesting that the Commission *nos had specified how much collect States of the EU in concept of taxes on vehicles, imposed of consumption on petrol, diesel, etc., and how proportion of taxes collected invests afterwards in infrastructure and works of repair.
Equally agree with Mrs. speaker in asking to the Commission that define the priorities on the plans selected, to end to use with the greater possible efficiency the available resources.
The Commission appreciates also the important paper that the European Parliament exerts when including the fight against violence in work program of the European Union.
competition in matter of juridical protection of consumers has to attribute , to end to guarantee the internal coherence of the text approved, to the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Inner Market.
Of here that it consider very grave the decision that takes *usted, gentleman President, very grave in the current context -although this was not so grave- and very grave also for the future of Parliament and for the future of democracy in *Europa.
Was as it went, Group has presented knowingly amendment so as to embezzle the juridical protection of consumers to the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens.
Gentleman President, have two functions: in the first place, like original author of the document directed to change the structures of the commissions and, second, like president of the commission commissioned in this moment of politics relative to consumers.
In this end of the century *XX, violence in #all forms exerted against boys, teenagers and women has gone taking an increasingly worrisome look.
Thus it is indispensable that program of community action #can inscribe in a general context that at the same time keep a strong social security and allow an economic growth that generate put of durable work.
But statistics do not reflect to #that that by retirement anticipated or measures do not appear in unemployment statistics, is to say, that unemployment of age persons is, in reality, higher.
*Señorías, now, in name of the Confederal Group of the European Unitary Left\/Nordic Green Left, and, by the maximum time of six minutes, go to give the word to Mrs. *Ilivitzky.
#This has to so much to the lower level *salarial of women -that women suffer, therefore, by double game- as to the fact that the professional careers of women are shorter and discontinuous owing to assistance tasks.
*Me allow to remember that this situation is resulted of the granting taken to States Joined, in moment to sign the Treaty of Blunt, of a right to soya import to the Community with a type #zero.
The Commission always has protected in that the reduction of prices *redunda in benefit of competitiveness of the EU. Suppose, as, that #can conclude that reasoning also applies to the sector of starch.
Equally wanted to express my gratitude to the Secretariat of this commission, that has taken always an excellent work so that regulation was to the height of the needs of the parliamentary work.
Lamentably, #this has not been always the case and to the concrete reason finish to allude on purpose now President of Regulation Commission, #Ben *Fayot, #as well as colleague, Mr. *Corbett.
colleague, Mr. *Corbett, has alluded to that in Parliament existed an opinion to take of this contractual text, relatively clear, *algo different of it that appeared and figure in the text of the Treaty.
Regarding the positive looks, wanted to underline that we have not taken a modification *ad *hoc limited to the frame of the exercise of 1996 but that have reached a valid reform for the coming years.
Is precise to vote institutional reforms oriented to the promotion of a dynamic competition and of flexibility together with the requirement of the maintenance, but also of modernisation and of the systems of the social security.
In the last months have had from time to time strong debates on #if we #would have to choose among having politics expansionary as it wanted the Group *Socialdemócrata following the example of Mr. *Lafontaine or #if by the contrary #would have to follow the rules that have agreed.
Consider urgently necessary that keep the three more important points, in concrete, the pact for stability and employment, politics *salarial oriented to productivity and the need to make structural reforms.
In these conditions, as, have to avert #all potential division in the interior of the Union and *esforzarnos so that adhesion to the Economic and Monetary Union of #all the countries members was a reality it before possible.
Definitely, #this #would not be possible #if #all participants in this project -the Council, Parliament and also, after #some initial vacillations, the Commission- had not collaborated with a very constructive spirit.
Wanted to stand out especially the constructive paper of Commissioners #Anita *Gradin, *Karel go *Miert and #Mario *Monti, but wanted to *elogiar also on purpose to the Presidency of the Council, to speaker, Mr. *Bösch, #as well as to the secretariats of the three institutions by the enormous work that have made.
In the analysis of the Annual Report of 1997 of the European Court of Accounts the Council has had also in account #all the 25 specific reports that have presented in the course of the year 1998.
During the approval process of the management and to the light of the report of the Court of Accounts, formulate a series of questions very *inquisitivas to the Commission.
Expect that, *cuando the Commission attend again in front of Parliament, accept and use like plan of work these questions formulated in work document, in particular on politics in matter of staff, on the Offices of Technical Assistance and #Leonardo and form as they manage *PHARE and *TACIS.
Of course, have worked a bit with an amicable pressure, especially, by part of the Presidency of the Council and of our Assembly, so that the Commission comprise of time that #can not deny, without more, things that are on the table.
treats of work document excellent and, of course, *yo personally share the philosophy of the approach, that is a clear philosophy and that, to time, specifies the essential points.
*Nos seems important that the #european citizens do not have the impression of that the Community is conditioned in adoption capacity of decisions like consequence of the entrance in vigour of the new Treaty or of the parliamentary election.
attention to the elderly, work for handicapped persons and projects of environment, #etcetera, to the equal that Mrs. *Thyssen neither want to take election and leave freedom to States members so that they choose among the possibilities that offers the proposal and so that they watch it that better *les avenges with needs and possibilities.
Finally, have to underline that #if, as I boast, #all *nosotros wish the fast adoption of this proposal by the Council, so as to fulfil terms signalled by Mrs. *Thyssen, is to say, the entrance in vigour on 1 January 2000, #can not admit the amendments.
Therefore, in measure -appear #if it was not like this- #can share aspirations that are the #mine, in an assessment of political realism in a matter that affects to employment and in that urgency is maximum.
In point 8, «Presentation of documents», in the *subpunto *ab) mentions decision project of the European Parliament relative to the Statute of Deputies to the European Parliament and to continuation appears a reference «*C».
Is truth that is a subject linked to Diary 2000, but do not find reason that endorse urgency asked by the Council, since disposal has to go in in vigour during the year 2000 and, in consequence, there #be sufficient time so that the new Parliament #can *examinarla.
The Treaty already has gone in in vigour and his first consequence is a greater participation of the future President of the Commission and of the European Parliament in the nomination of the Commission.
Wanted to underline also that expect that it have a political balance, is to say, a balance of conceptions and political opinions and also balance that reflect paper of the main political strengths in Parliament.
Finally, expect truly that in case that it assume *usted power, in any case work urgently in favour of a #balkan initiative and also review the calendar of enlargement politics to the light of the current events.
Is interesting because it is socialist and because it is #french. Interesting because it is socialist and affirms that the problem of employment will be able to confront only #if it guarantees, especially, growth goal and establishes in a 3 %; interesting because it is #french and affirms the need to begin to consider to the Council of the euro integrated by 11 members as *primer test of economic government European.
In consequence, challenged by an international crisis that goes back to put in cloth of trial certainty of the end of the *II World-wide War, #this is, that war was impossible in *Europa, have to *dotarnos of new political programs and necessarily ambitious, #if we want really go back to find soul of *Europa that *usted so much mentions.
require new approaches, under form of a participation reinforced of States members; subsidiariness also in the execution of the #european tasks discharge of work to *Bruselas and reinforces consciousness of the *corresponsabilidad of #all, consciousness that up to now has not existed.
This speech, nevertheless, #can not take it with *cerrazón, no #can it take with a continent that puts his own limits, although it has converted in greater: have to take it accepting the challenge that, in this case, is also responsibility.
will Happen to form part of history of village like destroyer of Serbian and no is more that repeat experience that already lived before #others that placed in front the adjective «big» to the name of nation.
Also has seen that the idea that NATO #can constitute alternative to Nations Joined -although it only went for a region circumscribed, but that extends much more there of *Europa- has shown to be an erroneous conclusion; *yo always went of #that seem.
#Everything *eso means an enormous and costly effort, in addition to the military borne by States members to contribute thousands of millions of euros that will need to fund #all measures of the international community.
Therefore, take advantage of this opportunity, in name of the Commission, to ask to Parliament and to the Council that facilitate to the Commission in moment the instruments and bottoms necessary to take our contribution to #that *tremendo imperative that we will have to confront together.
Have written #one and time to the competent persons, is to say, to President of the European Parliament, to President of the Commission, to NATO and to Mr. #Clinton.
In similar conditions, the only military victory possible runs the big risk to be a victory *pírrica, far of conditions of a just and durable peace, that is it that ask in these moments.
war that scheduled to win in two days but that after five weeks has not waned. war initiated to save to persons of the ethnic cleansing and that has given like result refugee million.
The countries of the Union have to be had to support Plan #Marshall for the region of the *Balcanes to reconstruct cities destroyed and also to counter hate that, of mood, goes to remain during generations like broth of crop for new conflicts.
Of mood, do not create absolutely neither by instant, treating of a so gross character as *Milosevic, that was sensitive to measure like the unilateral cessation of attacks to begin to negotiate.
In the twelve last months there #be had the establishment of the euro and deserve an external politics that was to the height of the perspectives created in the rest of the world by our monetary union.
Although it result painful, there #be not explanation for a #willing Union to argue war no by oil, no for achieving can, but for *oponerse to perversion of the ethnic purification in heart of *Europa.
Forget, by account and risk, that *Constantinopla was, during centuries, the first capital #european of culture, *cuando ancestors of the Council of current Ministers were in ruins of a past glory.
Have sinned, in senses, by *complacencia: often say that justification of the European Union is the to rid of wars inside borders of *Europa and forget it that is *sucediendo just in front of borders of *Europa and responsibility to the *respecto.
This circumstance demands diversification in the interior of the Union, the *cual #would owe to time centre around a union among States, confederation, in place of a union of States, a federation.
Gentleman President, in the meeting of the Conference of Presidents of this afternoon get to an agreement to treat to organise the vote so that it was a clear vote that show #who is in favour to put order and #who no.
For example, the subject of the *inelegibilidad and of the incompatibility, limitation of the number of mandates, the reduction of the number of deputies, the *superación effective of conflicts of interests.
Budget Commission thinks, and *yo share this opinion, that the goal of not using more of the 20 % of the total game of administrative costs for Parliament, a goal that certainly are from takes years, has to fulfil without fail.
Is to appreciate that the administration *nos have ensured that it will be able to fulfil #all the additional tasks that arise after going in in vigour the Treaty of *Amsterdam, #as well as the that originate to cause the preparation of enlargement, with the current personnel.
By reason, budget Commission has supported fundamentally the new politics of personnel, #whose central point is the promotion according to the criterion of merits achieved during years, it that will have like consequence that promotion make after some five years respectively.
Believe that Parliament that want to fulfil with the tasks to the that is exposed from the Treaty of *Amsterdam, has to have of a structure of personnel, also on a structure of personal collaborators, that *le make possible to make these tasks in whole.
Therefore it #would recommend to the new Parliament, to go back to occupy of point, because *nos have detained two years for having fulfilled tasks, and also *nosotros will have to go back to treat point, #if we want to make a good work.
With the approval of the preliminary draft of general budget for the exercise 2000, the Commission has initiated the budgetary procedure for the budgetary authority.
In my opinion the common position of the Council, independently of it defective that it was by the no participation of the Commission, finds in Transport Commission, as it has explained it President, and #this do not gathers this week.
#If we want *encaminarnos to an inner market that work *óptimamente, #all consumers #would have to have the right to be able to enjoy of a big level of protection, the same in #all States members #where buy, to *través of the extremely fast field of the new media, #such like Internet and email.
Certainly agree with #some of the amendments presented by the speaker, included the need to establish term of seven days skillful so that provider return money received of consumer.
The Commission #can accept the principle established in the amendment 21 to offer to consumers before the celebration of the hire additional information or *resumida like a protection of the complete contractual conditions.
#If consumer mounts product *él same and produces defect owing to failure in setting instruction allocated to customer, this failure drops under guarantee right.
Without embargo, the own speaker of opinion -that do not know #if it is here- recognises that these administrative costs #can have to to paper that play experts, to connection with network, to the analysis, to training.
Seen that there are not deputies that take part in the debate, the Presidency wanted to *felicitarla by report and comment that interest fault probably have to more to consensus that arouses that to discrepancy with the subject.
Was Parliament the that, even before the Treaty went in in vigour, put on the table of the Council a very complete text in the that, with the maximum transparency, included #all looks of our situation, even #that in the that it always has been #ours competition decide.
In quality of President of this Assembly, has loaned hearings of a new and innovative way to deputies novel, *algo that has been received with big satisfaction and has been respected by deputies.
In months that have had the privilege to direct to my Group, #can confirm the courtesy that *usted has shown with person -of it that today give faith here- and confirm also the extraordinary opening with the that makes work.
The Council has agreed the past week begin with the preparation of a stability pact for the *sureste of *Europa, an initiative that meanwhile is hailed openly by the whole of the international community.
Already State Bosses and of Government have wanted to designate to President of the most political Commission, commissioned to explode #all the federalistic possibilities that offers the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Gentleman President in exercise of the Council, believe that so much in intervention of President *Santer -that has been a splendid intervention and want to *felicitarle thus- as in the of the rest of the colleagues of Parliament goes to find *usted a rare unanimity.
Like help to the *preadhesión have put to disposal roughly 22.000 millions of euros for approach #as well as other 58.000 millions of euros for costs conditioned by enlargement, is to say, that in finance period has of 80.000 millions of euros for enlargement but that only #can spend #if really it carries out enlargement.
#If *me allow that it make a personal observation - probably is my last intervention in front of the European Parliament- is interesting to see that Diary like Diary 2000 is of course conflict of distribution among States members.
is not that the argue, is not that it deny to Mr. *Prodi freedom of consciousness, but, because I am linked to laicism, *garante precisely of this fundamental freedom everywhere and for #all, expect of President of the Commission that watch thus, and have #some doubts on the matter.
For the future, turns to «strength #american, in the wide sense of the term, [<lpar>$^that<cnjsub>$^]#\<rpar\> expresses symbolically by means of the media; considers, sure enough, by #some able to constitute the unitary reference for *Europa in research of soul.
Have to ascertain that the rules of the international trade that applies the *OMC and that *nos prevent to use on purpose the principle of caution, have seen ratified in the agreements of the Round *Uruguay by the own Europeans, *extraviados *ellos same by bad advisers, like the Commission, too much *influenciada definitely by foreign interests.
Is precise to break with way as it is thought in actuality liberalisation of exchanges, without social and environmental rules, and is precise to counter the political hegemony, economic and monetary of States Joined, that finishes imposing the interest of companies #american like a *pseudo general interest.
hypocrisy of the European Council remains perfectly patent by the fact that it will be necessary to decide on at all less that 250 millions of euros for *Kosovo in term of two weeks, it that supposes utilisation of more of the three *quintas split of the total base for seven years.
In reading of the regulations that will approve tomorrow, seems that the cause of the insular regions will not have known significant advance with occasion of this reform of the Structural Bottoms.
This financial frame of half term neither gives answer to questions so stood out like the realisation of the euro and, in particular, the possible asymmetric crashes or the predictable results of the next negotiations in the field of the *OMC.
Always has been entirely opened in moment to keep conversations and debates, always comprehensible, always kind with members of the Commission of Regional Politics of Parliament.
The Commission, in report *trienal on cohesion, has considered this situation like #one of the fundamental causes that mark delay of these regions and condition takeoff definite.
The that for parts exist feasible commitments owes alone and exclusively to *nosotros, as *nos have directed to *ustedes openly with proposals of commitment to prevent that his *terquedad *nos carried to the Conciliation Committee, as #this #would have meant the *paralización of projects, since then money #would not have come to time of *Bruselas.
Solidarity inside the European Union and with States of *preadhesión, employment concentrated of credits, creation of places of work, reduction of bureaucracy and preparation for enlargement eastwards, #this have been from the principle the goals of reform of the structural Bottoms.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, the new Regulation for promotion politics and development of the rural areas is definitely a big step in reform of the Common Agricultural Politics.
is not still an authentic tree, but #if the Commission and the Council occupy with intensity of youngster *arbolito, will result a strong tree and with hit for politics in the rural areas.
Gentleman President, the goal of my report is the to endow to the European Union of the financial and budgetary frame adapted to confront the challenges of the next years.
Knowing these commitments, *nos will prepare of the corresponding mood for the new negotiations of the *OMC and enlargement negotiations and will have it besides in account in the execution of market regulation during the next years.
In it *tocante to payment date of the 31-10, am had to examine this question, #if well with limitation that it do not has to produce thus postponement of the budgetary exercise for the compulsory costs.
Consider work like economic opportunity, and to time like realisation of #one same means to study more and better along #all life, means to struggle against the material and current inequalities that affect to the possibility that person has to plan freely future.
But, on the other hand, neither #can accept a protectionist road like the strategy with the that were ruin and in the that were responsibilities that have in front of the world, in particular with the less developed zones.
How measured thinks to adopt the Council to avert the repetition of this type of actions and to guarantee freedom of circulation of citizens in the EU?
*Me #would enjoy *darle graces by answer, without embargo, do not understand why leave to side disposals of the regulation of personal as no exists at all that it prevent that in integration respect the valid norms in the Council.
The concrete question of how goes to take to reduce of *algún mood damages *ocasionados and, possibly, to pose juridical claims by part of the European Union, is a question that has to direct to the Commission and no to the Council.
The Resolution 687 of the Security Council of Nations Joined urged to *Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of Cross #Red with regard to the release of prisoners.
In it *tocante to his wider question on the global stability of the region, the 26\/27-4-1999 the Council got to the conclusion to begin with the *preparativos for a stability pact for the *Sureste of *Europa.
But equally is true that, also jointly, #can not deny the fact that a big group of society, persons in a position of disadvantage, among *ellas women and minorities, need an additional attention.
The agricultural model European do not know exactly #which is neither nobody knows it, but, in any case, pretend to defend model, a model that keep to agriculturalist in earth and the less uninhabited earth.
Gentleman President, lady Commissioner, *Señorías, the financial frame decided in *Berlín is totally unsuitable and insufficient to give answer to the needs and to the goals of cohesion, that #would have to orient the #european construction and his current and future ambitions.
Expect that we leave clear to #everyone and in moment that have carried out the #granting that expected of *nosotros in negotiations in the World-wide Organisation of Trade and that do not contemplates neither an alone granting more to the #european agriculturalists until they have passed these seven years.
This process has finished well, has had a happy epilogue for the countries of cohesion and for the poorest regions, #where concentrate, in fact, from now, the structural helps.
Has finished well, #can not by less to say it, for my country, that goes to receive with charge to the structural helps an annual average lightly upper to the annual average of the period 1994 to 1999.
The nuclear security is a very important, but in adhesion process #can not force like this without more to the closing of nuclear head offices, neither *presionar of way to the countries.
My Group, the *PPE, #can not more that ascertain the result of the Summit of *Berlín that, #if well it represents a considerable improvement in relation with the original proposal of the Commission, remains short #if we take into account the needs of producers.
In *tercer place, #if it produced the blockade to measure and, afterwards, remitted again to the legislative authority, this return affected only to the Council, no jointly to the Council and to Parliament, even #if these two institutions conform jointly the legislative authority.
Really there are reasons to begin to say that *México do not has reference frame, the *marchamo democratic, etc. But believe that it better that #can take by *México, by democracy and by the agreement with the European Union is to say that yes .
The fact that of the total of the #mexican exports to the European Union only the 9 % are agricultural and that exist a big complementarity in the commercial flow, #would have to facilitate the fast negotiation and entrance in vigour of this agreement.
Gentleman President, only wanted to remember to #some colleagues, and in particular to Mr. *Elles, that training of the will of the institutions, in accordance with a jurisprudence *consolidadísima of the Court of Justice of *Luxemburgo, is not matter *dispositiva: is question of public order and is in the Treaties.
Gentleman President, wanted to *rendir a *calurosísimo homage to my colleague, Mrs. *Oddy, by this report that, of mood characteristic, has carried out in the last days of Parliament in a commission in the that had worries and #where existed immense juridical and technical complications.
And will vote against because we understand that they break this balance, because, in spite of it that has said Mr. *Barzanti that, like philosophy share totally, believe that lean service takes to content providers, in general terms to the authors, in other fields and -answering to Mr. *Whitehead- to consumers, #if we take juridical voluntarism.
In my opinion, the European Union #would have to show active with seen to establish a favourable and effective movement to protect the civil rights in the computer networks.
In the amendment 36 proposes that providers that loan services of information society will have to conserve #all data that require to hour to investigate and identify to the providers of illegal material.
The majority of the amendments that contains the report of Mrs. *Oddy clear and improve the initial proposal and *me cheers to indicate that the Commission will accept the amendments *núms. 1, 2, 4, 6 -this last only in the #english version-, 7, 12, 13, 16-20, 22, 24, 32-34, 37, 40, 41, 43, 55-57, 62 and 65-67.
#This a sensitive and very important area in the that took special efforts in the original proposal to get to a solution of reasonable commitment that took into account #all the interests in game.
Have examined also the argument that *usted has exposed on #if this decision in yes comports budgetary decisions and also has examined it attentively our Juridical Service, is to say, #if it comports budgetary decisions for the that article 272 #would demand qualified majority.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, *yo also want to break spear in favour of argumentation of *Detlev *Samland, and *eso by the following reason. Gentleman President, the jurisprudence that *usted quotes stipulates that the institutions #can not review to drop the majorities established by the Treaty.
#If it is really necessary that the Treaty demand in each case, of precise way, the qualified majority, and limit enlargement cases of this qualified majority, said agreement *interinstitucional, as it finishes to suggest it Mr. *Colom *i Naval, is inadmissible.
The European Commission approved the past 28 April budget preliminary draft of the European Union for the exercise 2000, *primer year of application of the new financial perspectives.
The tenacity and perseverance of members of the Commission of Regional Politics of the European Parliament and of our two speakers have given finally fruits.
#This obtains a complementary endowment of 15 millions of *ecus to compensate the loss of suitability with regard to the Goal 1, whereas the *Hainaut #french, that is bordering, do not obtains at all: discrimination that do not justifies neither the *PNB neither unemployment tax of the two regions.
To the term of my mandate, in May of 1999, my political positions on these social questions, as they are agriculture, feeding, the rural development and the environment, follow being #the same.
The fact to want to fix a maximum limit to helps and of *reducirlas regularly constitutes a total aberration regarding income level of producers.
#If they achieve to approve common norms that elevate protection level of consumers in #all the countries, no longer will have *tanta importance that the valid norms are the of the country of the *remitente or the of the country of origin.
Vote against of the resolution proposal on *Kosovo, because I consider that it do not helps at all to find a political solution, neither finally immediate of war without sense - especially today, 45 days afterwards, in that they begin to discern hopes to escape of this tragic dead end.
treats definitely of a complex situation and expect, gentleman Commissioner and Vice-president, that in name of the Commission and in name of the European Union adopt the timely measures to reinforce these tendencies, since in actuality *Turquía is of *Europa instead of approximating to *ella.
Never have wanted to justify acts neither intentions. Only expect that Government #turkish allow that it celebrate an open and just process, but alas #ours *angustiosos presentiments do not see at all relieved.
is not #worthy of democracy that *Malasia says to be the fact that citizens that express peacefully his points of political or religious sight are object of arrest and *encarcelación, and all *ello without that offer a suitable juridical security.
Is to say, in the international plane is consciousness of this situation, and no it is necessary to exasperate because this type of battles, like the that *usted signalled, finally, as it #be to occur always with #all the problems that affect to humanity, is to base of a daily fight and *tenaz as they finish achieving results.
By it that to me *respecta, gentleman President, wish to say that I regret that the considering *G of this proposal of common resolution allow to warm up doubts on the comments that #can effect Parliament on purpose of the initiatives taken by president of Development Commission and Cooperation, Mr. #Michel *Rocard.
Finally -and will not insist too much in point-, responsibility of *Francia, illustrated until the caricature by the coincidence among the *decimoctavo coup d'état in the *Comoras and the opening in #París of trial to mercenary #Bob *Denard, author, in 1975, 1978, 1989 and 1995, of four coups d'état in *Moroni and suspicious of the murder of two Bosses of State *comoranos.
The Islamic Republic of the *Comoras is State that from takes years, practically from independence, suffers an institutional and structural crisis very grave, as they have remembered the colleagues that have taken part before that *yo.
Perhaps know that there #be had a statement of ministers of the *G8 offering conditions for a solution in *Kosovo much less *intransigentes that the five conditions in the that has insisted up to now and that goes back to link of significant form to the Security Council.
Regarding the system, more general, of recognition of titles, am likewise in favour of an improvement and of a reinforcement of recognition of qualifications, since #if well the recognition of titles is theoretically satisfactory, do not translates sufficiently in the facts.
commitment that has accepted in conciliation relieves charge of #SME, which fits to expect that it encourage to companies to orient efforts to goals more favourable and that boost the creation of employment.
In the European Union and in States members has awarded especially a fundamental paper to the small companies with predominance of hand of drama to hour to promote the creation of employment.
Passed a week from the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam, and had account of the every time greater importance that is the procedure of *codecisión, believe that have reasons for *felicitarnos by this victory of Parliament and of democracy.
Likewise estimate fundamental that *nos have proposed to reduce the compulsory variables, no only regarding charge, but also in it that to the number of variables refers. By it other, are adherents of a level of acceptable information, is to say, of a fine relation cost-efficiency.
Gentleman President, in the frame of the initiative *SLIM, the Commission presented on 30 May 1997 two proposals of regulation with the end to simplify the basic rule of the system *INTRASTAT.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the report (To4-0234\/99) of Mr. *Malangré, in name of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and of Rights of Citizens, on insolvency procedures.
In the year 1995 agreed by means of a resolution of these characteristic it that it had to understand by interception in technical sense, #if it had to register only the content of conversation #telephone or also hour and telephone number of speakers.
To consequence of these massive imports that hardly cover, on the other hand, price of the matter prevails, big number of #european textile companies are at present losses and see loomed survival, it that puts in grave risk the maintenance of work places.
Of compliance with article 13 of the Regulation, the candidatures to the functions of President of the European Parliament will have to present , with the consent of the interested, by a political Group or by thirty-two deputies like minimum.
Lady #Heidi *Hautala, in the last days have already worked very together, and an expression of this fine collaboration is, certainly, that *usted like Speaker of the Group of the Greens finds seated in the first row, the same that President of the Liberal, Mr. *Pat *Cox.
#This *Europa initiates the term of office in moment of big difficulty by it that *sucede in borders: of big difficulty because the process of political unification and the project of economic politics follow being far of our scope.
A strong Presidency, attentive and able, balanced and just, like the that *usted already showed that it #can exert, *nos gives hope and confidence of face to work together, #all together, to end to satisfy the needs of these #european citizens that follow expecting of *nosotros a clear answer about future.
As *les manifested takes instant, call attention of His *Señorías, since to the not exceeding the number of candidates of the number of places for covering, *les propose that it choose by acclamation to these fourteen candidates for Vice-president places.
Lady Speaker, wish to take part in relation with record because I understand that, in day of yesterday, the Conference of Presidents and #all the political Groups subscribe jointly objection to the constitution of the called «technical Group of independent deputies» and *yo believe that said objection has to state explicitly in record.
In spite of #all the relative criticisms to particular cases, there #be *algo that #would not have to forget, to know, that without work *tenaz and engaged of the Commission neither had been able to resolve the numerous and difficult problems precisely under the Presidency #german.
*Señorías, in stage that now initiate will have to take advantage of the dynamics that has configured in the past semester, like result of tension among the crisis and reform needs, to give new steps to integration.
But the decisions that have adopted in the last six months, under the Presidency #german of the Council, will mark the future of the European Union until very gone in the next decade.
has gone back to admit in society to war like half of politics and will continue advancing by this *funesto *derrotero with integration of the military pact of the *UEO in the European Union and strength creation of intervention.
*Me #would enjoy to ask #if these three States members, that took in *Amsterdam of the strengthening of the institutions an indispensable condition and, therefore, previous for the conclusion of the first negotiations of adhesion, corroborate reservations attach to the Treaty of *Amsterdam or #if they have attenuated position meanwhile.
#This presupposes our firm decision of *oponernos in case necessary with military means *cuando no longer exist another possibility, to #that that think that they #can impose politics of nationalism with violence, the murder, terror or expulsions in mass.
In the first place, because it did not take reform of finance of the own resources to split exclusively of the gross national product, that is the only contributory base just, *equitativa and transparent.
Besides, need integration of the guidelines on employment politics and economic and, it that it is very important, need a review of the institutional frame of the #european pact by employment.
Need as more democracy and no an increase of the democratic deficit like consequence of the #european pact by employment and Parliament has demanded it in the period of previous term of office.
This Assembly will know that we have gone back to go in in a critical stage in the peace process of *Irlanda of the North, a process that have backed the successive presidencies.
The challenge that have to confront consists in *replantear, adapt and improve the organisation for *convertirla in more efficient and effective, so as to struggle against frauds to #all levels and to put to the Institution to service of the #european citizens.
do not pretend that *Europa have #all the answers to these problems; it that I want to mean is that we have to show obstinacy to contribute to resolve, to scale #european, these questions, since, by his same nature, surpass the purely national borders.
In effect, some recent events, #such as war of *Kosovo and the new crisis in the sphere of the alimentary security that has produced in *Bélgica, but has, obviously, repercussions in #all *Europa, are events particularly significant and believe that the answers that have to give -and *usted has given #some interesting signals to #that *respecto- are answers that have to be ambitious.
President Mr. *Prodi shows interest with regard to the Conference *Intergubernamental, but *me seems that it do not values it sufficient the fact that the critical state of the Institutions and of fault relation of confidence with citizens is not indifferent neither political neither socially.
From this perspective, the question of the headquarters of organisms that will occupy of reconstruction is very important, and want to believe that it will keep the election of *Salónica like point *nodal strategic from the that they will develop #all the necessary plans for this substantive reconstruction.
The Council of General Subjects of the European Union highlighted the past Monday that the Union will follow helping to village #serbian, the *cual suffers the consequences of #one *nefasta political.
deputies of the European Parliament have underlined in diverse occasions paper so important that the Union exerts like engine and like guarantee of the peaceful and harmonic development of our continent.
Split in my exhibition of the idea that the Union #can succeed in functions only through a narrow and transparent collaboration among #all parts of #the same, #as well as by means of the active support of citizens of *Europa.
Also need a *fortalecemiento of the credibility of the Union to take part with property in grave subjects of competition; the establishment of concrete terms for reconstruction of *Kosovo is the most acute.
But also has produced wounds in #some Governments *carentes of a clear external politics. Was as it was, has marked the failure of ten years of diplomacy and has put in evidence the *incurias, lacks and sometimes wastes of the international cooperation.
The impression that has is that it did not think so much in the activities of immediate reconstruction and for the that it #would have to be competent this Agency but in the general needs of economic help in the whole of the region.
Have to learn to combine iron hand of NATO with the glove of economic silk of the EU and offer cooperation and help for the economic and democratic development.
#This is the fundamental point of the case *Öcalan, #this is, the maintenance in *demasiadas legislations of norms that punish like offence the exercise of the right of self-determination of villages in his extreme meaning of faculty of secession, even with means no violent and democratic.
Of form that there are autonomous Communities in *España, *Länder in *Alemania or Communities in *Bélgica, etc., also #would take fault an alike solution inside *Turquía for the *kurdos, so that they #can enjoy, it same that *usted signalled of *Finlandia, to be able to talk each #one his own tongue, have free press on problems, have a regional Parliament.
Have to promote the fight against drug trafficking, against crime organised, against the citizen insecurity; have to invest in the protection of citizens and no *transigir with this unseen face that constitutes relation among terrorism, traffic of arms, crime organised, traffic of nuclear material.
*Dinamarca was the *primer country that proposed the importance of the no military methods, but *Finlandia, in quality of President of the Council, is the country that has to carry to the practical it more *contudentemente possible, and with collaboration of #all, this valid initiative.
Want to signal also that it is very important the mission of the international Court attendant to judge war crimes, and in particular the court commissioned of *Yugoslavia is in this moment an important *colobarador #ours in #all this question.
The reform process has begun in #all the institutions, among things thanks to that the European Parliament in occasions has called attention on these subjects.
The Assembly will be familiarised with article 213 that, among things, demands specifically that members of the Commission respect «the duties of honesty and discretion, regarding acceptance, time finished mandate, of determined functions or benefits».
A simple example that #can give to the Assembly of the internal games to the that they have devoted cabinet bosses -no commissioners- in a concrete subject of personnel serves like button of sample of how handled things.
*Yo hail the decision -that believe that it has been very fast- of the Council in this case and also the explanations of the Commission in relation with performance in this case, that has been of an enormous rapidity.
Also it is necessary to recognise that pollution of the *piensos with dioxin shows that neither the current legislation neither measures of valid protection are sufficient to prevent pollution of the *piensos with harmful substances, like dioxin.
*Refiriéndome to measures taken by the Council #would remember that the Agriculture ministers and of Health have followed very of wall the crisis of dioxin and have debated on *ella in the first opportunity that had, to know, in the meetings summoned in June.
Before finishing my exhibition want to observe that the crisis of dioxin has shown clearly that the consequences of this type of events no limit to the zones, not even to the countries, in that they produce.
country of the world is free of dioxin, and #can bring to collation #all a series of examples of pollution by dioxin that in the last years have appeared in the headlines of the most varied countries.
regret It a lot, and *me fear that the only that in this subject goes to *movilizar really to the Council goes to be the agreement that have closed recently with the Americans, is to say, the agreement that the Americans will be able to control #if in *Europa fulfil the hygienic standards that also *nosotros expect of *ellos.
In consequence, gentleman President, insist especially in the proposal taken by Group that Parliament believes a provisional commission that occupy in group of #all the subjects related with security of foods and with the public health, and no only of partial details.
Have to *decirles, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President, that *me cheered with measures that finish to announce *ustedes, but yes that it wanted to *recordarles that #some of measures in fact were proposed by the European Parliament, takes already time, from the conclusion of investigation Commission on cows crazy.
But, finally, gentleman Commissioner, gentleman President, *me #would enjoy to underline, to the equal that colleagues, that never will be able to resolve the problem of security of feeding #if we do not begin to think in a drastic *replanteamiento of agriculture, of our alimentary production.
On the other hand, have to say that for my is totally inadmissible that in dioxin crisis agriculturalist union #belgian deny to collaborate in the agricultural restructuring and in the reduction of the census grazier in *Bélgica.
#Many of ingredients are identical (practices *displicentes and even despicable in the preparation of #some alimentary products of animal origin in a world of intensive agriculture and panic and deception in #some of States members affected *cuando discovers initially the origin of pollution)
Thus, plead by the constitution of a commission of temporary parliamentary investigation, attendant to supervise that they put on the table #all the problems and study #all the group of educations that have to take out.
Want to stand out that to this grave crisis of health is with instruments that were conceived for other goals tied to the Common Agricultural Politics, as it is the Permanent Veterinary Committee allocated to understand of the animal health in himself\/hisself same.
Lady Speaker, #would have *peido the this morning early word in the approval of Record #if it had known that the annex 3 had not delivered by seats.
Think, for example, in the fault of transparency of part of the #belgian Government, that took in alerting to the European Commission, #as well as to information fault of consumers.
In consequence, *le pray that the Table elucidate and treat #this with the greater celerity, as of luck go in in the summer pause with a totally garbled situation regarding the delegations and #this do not has to *suceder in Parliament.
Fine to the French Committee Organiser *equivale to deprive to base football and to the promotion of sport of bottoms for *ingresarlos in arks of the European Commission.
With occasion of Glass of the World of 1998, of the two millions of entrances sold, the greater part of #the same was directly managed by the International Federation of Football, that sent contingents to the 203 national associations of football, reserving a greater percentage for the 24 countries classified, among the that it found Realm Joined.
Finally, in chamber place, is normal that, regarding a popular sport and to a country organiser that invested nine *millardos of frank in this event, procure that the inhabitants of the country organiser approve and take part in event, it that also constitutes a key element of hit.
Already said ten minutes before it took part Mr. *Ford that the #belgian organisers and Dutches of championship of *Europa have put in contact with the Commission and that will not put to sale neither an alone entrance of discriminatory mood.
#This is a debate to watch to forward, to the future of the European Union and to strengthen institutions and, in particular, the European Commission, #whose central paper in the #european construction nobody #can put in cloth of trial.
modernisation and reform are, therefore, necessary and it is necessary *llevarlas to cape #if we want that the Commission #can, no only exercise his basic paper of guardian of the Treaties, but also of *impulsora of the process of taking of decisions and of correct agent of programs and projects that *le attribute.
In reality has occurred *algo that consider very important -and in this sense create to have understood also very well to my predecessor in the use of the word-: is precise to extract the consequences of errors and of the bad performance of the Commission.
Says that neither the Institutions neither the budgetary authorities gave has rapidity of a series of irregularities neither acted in the most correct way and wiser to avert the consequences that had.
The Committee of Independent Experts advanced the arguments to establish a committee for the rules of the public life in the #european field.
President, the key words of the second inform here presented are subjects like subsidiariness, competition delegation and the importance of the independent fight against fraud.
care grade with that we treat this symbol #can determine to a large extent recover confidence of citizens. will Watch that the Commission, and especially Mr. *Kinnock, make the promises that took in audiences regarding Mr. Go *Buitenen.
The Commission, to end of accounts, has acted in points. But in the case of the *EEB only has acted by pressure, also has acted in these questions only by pressure of the public opinion.
In the procedures made up to now, #many of Commissioners designated have had friendliness to promise in advance reform statute for his own fields and have alluded to commitments with concrete politics.
The 350 millions of persons that constitute association of the European Union will not feel appreciated to the European Parliament neither to the European Commission #if the public opinion considers that it exists *algún type of irritation in relations that keep.
And memory that *cuando was president of the #italian Council *le was withdrawn confidence by Parliament, even by those political strengths that changing of jacket -veto to know with how expensive and with how value- are had to vote to favour, after having voted in his against in Blunt.
In this context, gentleman President of the Commission, *permítame that signal that in audiences #some members of his Commission still did not seem to have given this step to access to Commissioner condition #european.
In it that concerns to the oral turn, has been work and a colossal effort so much for members of Parliament as for commissioners proposed and workers so much of the Commission as of Parliament.
*Permítame say of step that believe that auditions, of form, that push to commissioners candidates to adopt commitments that villages #would not approve, introduce to trial a real distortion in loyalty of the procedures.
*Me allow to take observation to mood of warning because the renewal of confidence that *usted same has asked with reason, gentleman *Prodi, also depends of course that it head *usted a Commission that #can make his free work of objections and that has to differentiate of ancestor precisely in look.
Have listened with attention the repeated statements of President and without prejudices auditions of members of the Commission, and #this *nos has allowed to appreciate commitment that poses a different relation among the Commission and Parliament.
Today *nos find in the back stage to the euro and, as it says President, in reflation stage, without embargo, the massive unemployment is conviction of politics #orthodox.
Thus, the Party *Independentista of Realm Joined pleads by the withdrawal of country of the European Union through the *revocación of the constitutive Record of the European Communities that so *equivocadamente subscribed Prime minister *Heath in 1972.
#This are, lady Speaker, *señorías, reasons by the that appeal to prudence of the Assembly, to moderation and especially to respect by the rights of minorities by the #which, it is necessary to say it, up to now #this had not honoured especially.
No had reaction to his reiterated and clear answers to question, and repeated until nausea subjects that affect to the #belgian inner politics and that at all have to see with the future charge of Mr. *Busquin, had account that #this is a multilingual Assembly.
In points 3 and 5 (to), (*b) of our resolution remains clear that #if Parliament loses confidence in commissioner, has to be sufficient with that it have simple majority to ask to president, Mr. *Prodi, the resignation of commissioner in question.
*Yo have present that, in quality of President designated of the Commission, already has accepted *usted #some fundamental political requirements that *le pose, with the end to take possible the application of the individual responsibility.
In this region, without embargo, find the most extensive borders among the countries that have requested adhesion to the Union, #as well as the only border with the big #european state of *Rusia.
The report of the independent group of experts indicates that the structures of the European Union and the Commission have been garbled and *desorganizadas during years concerning relations to be able to and of responsibility.
Have made a good beginning with audition, and after the morning vote, allow that the progressive strengths of this Assembly collaborate with the Commission to provide to the population of *Europa it that wishes.
*Usted deserves praise of Parliament by work that has made in the budgetary fields and especially in #some of the fields in the that has tried to change things in breast of the Commission.
In the agreement *interinstitucional declares that before surpassing finance frames it is necessary to look for forms to have finance and like this the Council has acted according to his own point of sight.
Gentleman President, *yo only wanted to *preguntarle to lady Minister #if it has considered the possibility to include to the International Monetary Bottom in the quoted conversations on the financial resources for *Timor oriental, *Turquía and *Kosovo, so that #all weight do not have to *recaer exclusively on *nosotros.
In the first place, is precise to develop great strategies that allow to control the migratory flows without putting to proof integration capacity of States members and citizens and help to avert the apparition of social conflicts.
On the other hand, the increase of cooperation among States members *nos forces to examine the rights of citizens from sight point wider that the of the national states.
And to follow applying these principles, is important that Parliament have an equal representation to the of the Council to hour to decide on the fundamental rights of citizens.
Well is that it have a temporary diet of protection, but only in exceptional circumstances and on condition that it was not diet that deny the right to the individual examination of asylum appeals.
#If the Commission goes to adopt this type of doctrine in the sphere of offence and of drugs, etc., #which goes to be the future of this European Union?
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, the goal of the European Council of *Tampere -as it remembered here in an extraordinary council- is the to determine the political orientations and the priorities in matter of creation of the zones of freedom, security and justice.
And like the participation of the national Parliaments in the process limits to the presence of individual representatives neither is represented plurality of the political tendencies.
Fits to remember here the important paper of operation *UNAMET of the UN and give the thanks to personnel by this tireless work that took possible the organisation of a referendum in some very difficult circumstances.
Mrs. #Emma *Bonino goes to explain why, in name of the political affinity of #that that believe in parliaments, democracy, in the Right and that abhor the *partitocracia, bureaucracy and falsity, no are neither go to vote.
But wanted to take advantage of also this explanation of vote for *referirme to the parallel resolution that groups varied commitments contracted by the Commission *Prodi in spheres in cases technical, but important, related with the code of behaviour, the ethical and transparency.
But, especially, there #be thing that *usted #can take in favour of peace, and thing is *propiciar respect to the historical rights of Basques, among the *cuales is the fiscal sovereignty, like the has any #another Been member of the EU.
Gentleman President, estimated colleagues, our negative vote to the nomination of the new Commission by the rest of the current mandate bases #among others arguments in the fact that it houses to four #ex commissioners that formed part of a school organ that saw forced to resign by bad management.
provision with half inks of #some of candidates, apparently still reluctant *cuando of it that treats is to mention the *Europa social or employment, or even audition very little *convincente of Mrs. Palace, do not have to hide group impression as a whole satisfactory.
To difference of ancestor *Helmut *Kohl, that five years ago accepted the proposal of the opposition for the Commission -to me *me cost to vote by *Monika *Wulf-*Mathies in 1994-, *Schröder did not show had to take into account to the current opposition *CDU\/*CSU, by more that won the #european elections in *Alemania.
The Commission also recognises that the reallocation of this sum is not possible already in category 4, but that says that it is necessary to take effort *extensivo to a reallocation in the group of the budget.
#All know that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee had a common organisational structure, the *SOC, but that, as a result of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and his put in operation, decided that it suppressed this common organisational structure.
The proposal treats of detour of commitment credits by value of 137 millions of euros. 30 millions of *ellos allocate to *Turquía, especially to help actions for the provisional accommodation of face to winter, is to say, helps of emergency.
And even more: the European Union finishes to decree an embargo of military material during four months to the #indonesian. ?How are four months after *veinticuatro years of compulsive sale of armament to Indonesian, knowing as it knew genocide that had takes *veinticuatro years in *Timor?
But #if it did not modifies politics, will leave to find partners in *Europa while managers of the current situation continue in power, already was in the Army, Parliament or the Government.
#If they do not detain slaughterings, also in other regions, and #if the #indonesian Government do not offers a protection, our opinion is that Nations Joined will have to happen to action also in #that other regions of Indonesian.
To debt that have from takes *veinticuatro years with *Timor Oriental, adds the fact that in days take #any demonstration in favour of *Timor Oriental, without embargo, do not takes in account the political hypothesis that, with #everything, will have to happen once again by the fact of *implorar to States Joined the possibility of a military intervention.
Besides, article also affirms that politics of the Union in look do not influences in the special characteristics of security politics and defence of States members.
Our main goal is the abolition of pity capital, but as among the countries that the apply find states of weight, the freezing of relations do not presents like a fine solution.
Gentleman President, the Council is conscious that the countries with extension coastal are responsible to a large extent of security of navigation and of defence of the maritime environment, so they have to fulfil norms that have regulated to the *respecto.
So much in quality of President in exercise of the European Union, as to national level, *Finlandia do not supports the release of politics in matter of drugs and neither the possibility to legalise substances.
Without embargo, it is necessary to take in account that in conversations to the *respecto has taken evident that countries, especially the countries in roads of development, fear that the Union demand determined labour norms with the intention to take impossible imports from countries.
Mr. *Korakas already *nos has taken to know that it considers that they #would not have to have been *reagrupadas, but like this has decided and *yo entrust in skill of the answers of President in exercise of the Council so that the two have the appropriate answer.
For *nosotros the structure that *nos proposes -and the Court of Accounts shares worries- presents a serious danger of *desmembramiento of the administrative authority of the Commission, in benefit of a managerial personnel *intergubernamental, that #can not accept.
Like this as, #would wish simply that *reflexionáramos on the autonomous structures of decision in *Pristina, that #would give to the population power to decide with *nosotros works that have to be undertaken, and that no existed #one "*superburocratización" in *Bruselas, tied to operation logic of the European Union.
#All efforts for elevating education and the medical assistance to an acceptable level, by very valuable that in himself\/hisself same are, have not been able to solve the problem of refugees.
(IN) Gentleman President, is for me a pleasure comment the fact that in this brief debate have had three inaugural interventions, included the of Mrs. *Schröder that, to his 21 years, is the youngest deputy to Parliament.
Costs to believe that in the fifteen countries of the European Union lose swim less that 7.500 lives simply because persons do not use security belt in the leading seats and in the rear seats.
In the future, the European Parliament will not allow that other institutions of the EU recommend type or form of reduction in the available budgets for security campaigns *vial.
#There is difficulties of type in the parliamentary control, #whose consequence is that it was increasingly *incontrolable action of the police and of the secret services and projects in the sector of the public security.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, in moment in that we say with the new Commission that is precise to give a main paper to the European Parliament, is natural that to time have to think in the relaunching of the external politics of the own Parliament.
Thus *me #would enjoy that the new Commission - and ask it now to Commissioner *Kinnock - make a general evaluation of efficiency of program *TACIS and afterwards *nos report on how think to improve program for the budget of the year 2000, so that we #can vote with greater confidence in favour of program *TACIS.
*Georgios *Papandreou, minister of External Subjects of #Grecia and Mr. *Tzem, the one who has charge in *Turquía, have decided that it include the subject of collaboration *heleno - #turkish for the fight against the natural catastrophes in diary of dialogue of *Atenas and *Ankara.
The official statements of *Moscú in the sense that neither the crisis in *Daguestán neither attempts of *Moscú will serve of pretext to declare exception state and, therefore, postpone the next elections to the *Duma, have reassured to the Commission.
Comprise that we #would have to argue with the Council of *Europa to try negotiate arrangement with *ellos, but has to *usted recognise that technically no longer have access to building because we already have left of paying rent.
Then *me seems enough *penoso that the #french legislation give apparently *tanta importance to the artistic property of some impossible corridors, lights and stairs but for example no to saving energetic, whereas in my country at least #one third part of the new houses have of solar signposts.
Want to add my voice to the numerous comments that already have taken and signal that I find totally incomprehensible that are here in the first place, *cuando have offices, halls of meeting and houses very fine in *Bruselas, and that it is absurd that #all the "Euro-circus" have had to be *penosamente moved to *Estrasburgo for three or maybe four days to month (pardon, five days this week).
*Me #would enjoy to say, although as #many of deputies also regret trip circus among the diverse headquarters of the European Parliament, that am fully satisfied with the design of my office of *Estrasburgo, especially #if, as *me promised, installs a cupboard with bolt.
Estimated colleagues, #that of *ustedes that they have assisted to Parliament during the last years know that in this Assembly are very #few the that, as *yo *cuando chaired the last commission for *EEB, have devoted so acutely and -almost #can say- with so much enthusiasm, to the question of security of meat, especially the of meat of *vacuno #british.
The solutions *reconducen to three very concrete fronts: 1) consumer; 2) a new agricultural revolution and environmental; 3) a precise political indication that it has to come precisely of the community organs.
The crisis of cows crazy and #news of the last months have put of self-evident that the alimentary security deserves deal *prioritario, although they also have shown that only *nos agree of *ello in difficult moments.
*Me cheer especially that today it find *usted here personally for *informarnos on a so important subject, although I believe that time passed from the nomination of the new European Commission is too much little so that, so much *usted like the competent commissioners, have been able to *ultimar concrete proposals.
#If in States Joined the *incumplimiento of the laws on the environment #can sanction with the publication of the name of company and of the director of #the same, do not see why *nosotros in the Low Countries #can not take *algo similar.
Without embargo, #can not but *mostrarme *perplejo and concerned so much in quality of scientist as of politician in front of the conclusions to the that has got in this decision, #this is, fix a maximum ceiling tolerated of *BPC of 200 *nanogramos of fat so much in the *volatería as in pig meats and derivatives.
Lady Speaker, the recent successive crises in the field of the alimentary security have put of self-evident of mood more *convincente that the protection of the public health has to be *prioritaria in front of #all the politics.
Results #worthy of *beneplácito and *tranquilizador that from the same beginning the new Commissioner, Mr. *Byrne, have shown an unambiguous commitment with recovery of confidence of consumers in the alimentary industry.
Expect that #this was the main priority of works of the next week in the context *ACP and that convert, gentleman Commissioner, in a proposal that the Commission and the European Union take #his, so as to that at last we #can *hacernos charge of this problem seriously.
In less of two decades, a very short period in the world of illnesses *infecciosas, AIDS has been the main cause of death in the *África *subsahariana.
Given the different nature of bottoms with regard to the normal projects in the *cuales contributes money to the budget, *me fear that in this case this idea of budgetary control, that #all accept and that #all defend, is not exactly applicable.
The formula that *yo *les #would propose now and to the that *me #can engage is that before it produce payment type inform, for example, to presidents of the commissions involved in these subjects, of form that Parliament have knowledge of #the same without that, by confidentiality duty that have to keep in #some subjects, *nos pose #any difficulty.
Have to introduce a specific solution consistent in modifying, by road of a concrete decision of the Council, the financial perspectives for a concrete point?
Sure enough, in measure in that *ello was possible have to exceed stadium of intention statements so frequently heard in the course of the last decade to find forceful concrete applications #if we wish to reach this goal, to end of modest accounts, of a 12 %.
Gentleman President, wanted to congratulate to Mr. *Langen, the speaker, by report on the approval of program *multianual for the promotion of sources of renewable energy in the Community, *Altener *II.
In reality, #can that not even it assign quantity, since the amendment *n1 5 to section 3 (new) of article 1 says, in reality, that #can reduce bottom quantity, #if it is not compatible with the financial perspective for the period that it treats.
#Many will be small plans, to scale of the community, specific of place, already use wind, waves, the solar energy, the combination of heat and electricity or even biomass.
Wanted to reiterate my gratitude and say that I expect that in the last review #can find the definite formula and, therefore, give a push to program *ALTENER, that is a clear impulse to utilisation of the renewable energies in *Europa.
Regarding the amendment 4, exists a clear need of complementarity, as we said takes moment when talking of program *ALTENER, regarding actions in the field of the energetic efficiency and of the renewable energies.
But is not less true that there #be had moments in that we appreciate, by part of the #european negotiators #as well as by part of #such or *cual Been member, behaviours excessively bureaucratic, defensive and until *cicateros, as also *nos concerned to perceive sometimes in speakers #south african tendency to give course backwards and to reopen questions that seemed already enclosed, with it that the process *demoraba more and more.
The decision of the World-wide Economic Summit, celebrated in Colony this year, to cancel 100.000 millions of dollars of debt of the *tercer world was important to #that *respecto and has to *surtir an effect catalyst for the adoption of measures by #all the countries of the EU and no only #one #few.
On the other hand, the signatories of the agreement do not hide it and say that "disposals relative to cooperation pretend to facilitate restructuring and modernisation of the #south african industry and boost competitiveness" .
By it other, have resulted divided interpretations and the opinions of the European Parliament that wanted an agreement that *acercara more to conditions of the Agreement of *Lomé, and of the Commission that has pronounced by adhesion, say, conditioned.
And, especially, that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of General Subjects of July of this year, *subscribe the specific agreement on wines before the provisional entrance in vigour of the commercial part of the agreement, foreseen for January.
While it do not apply the agreement on wines and liquors, will not go in in vigour neither the special financial assistance -15 millions of euros- to the sector *vinícola #south african neither the contingent of free wine of rights of 32 millions of litres.
Neither has agreed still that the EU liberalise the imports of #south african car products in term of three years, as it seems to announce the report in page 9.
During the next weeks and months, will follow closely the preparatory process with seen to this date to end to watch by that #all the important commercial #granting of the EU to *Sudáfrica initiate career in this date agreed.
#Can indicate the Commission how actions #can undertake to find urgently bottoms (for example, *MCA remaining, programs community), with the end that in #all territory #greek give an immediate preventive control of the *adecuación static of public buildings, schools, hospitals, etc., #as well as of places of work in mass, like factories, so that it verify resistance of the *edificaciones in question in cases of seisms of big magnitude?
With Mrs. *Diamantopoulou have communicated this same afternoon, to the Commission, actions that are possible in the frame of the Structural Bottoms to support to #Grecia and help to reconstruction, to repair.
The complicated access to valley of the *Panshir, the extremely explosive situation and the accused political sensitivity, that characterise the situation in place, demand intervention that has to be coordinated among the diverse humanitarian organisations to end to avert failures of estimate and bad decisions.
Believe that precisely the quantity of the community humanitarian help to Serbian underlines clearly wish to bet in favour of the population and up to now have been able to identify clear needs and justified of humanitarian character.
The greater part of pupils goes to have or already has a direction of post electronic own, the majority of the that work already the have and there are courses on Internet for pensioners.
abstention index registered in the recent elections to the European Parliament has shown, without embargo, that citizens are not sensitised in measure that #would be convenient in relation with the EU and goals.
Second -and #this *reviste an immense importance and examined it in Nations Joined with the General Secretary and the General Secretary Attach-, the question of finance of the civil administration to short and half term.
Also am convinced that no only are forced to support to the democratic circles and his modest hits by moral reasons but also because #one *Turquía democratic that #can solve problems in *Turquía will be of positive for the inner security of the European Union.
Thus -independently of #which was the calendar and the exact procedure to follow- in *Helsinki it is necessary to command a signal of hope to persons of #turkish origin and *kurdo #as well as to democracy in *Turquía.
Had account of the importance *geoestratégica of *Turquía and of paper that always has exerted in defence of *Europa, believe, finally, that also #would suit to include in the agenda of works the questions of external politics and of security.
Gentleman President, Mr. Roman *Prodi declared in presentation speech to the European Parliament that have by in front enlargement period of twenty or even thirty years, during the *cual the number of members will rise to *veinticinco, or perhaps to more.
#If it accepted to *Turquía in quality of country candidate to adhesion, the criteria of *Copenhague #would suppose path species or course for the future evolution of the country and #would contribute to orient development of #the same to values that here represent.
Believe that *cuando take perceivable that this approach to the western values *le offers to *Turquía better possibilities of economic development and more field of political action, is possible that the #islamic countries take to *Turquía like positive example and that consolidate of form development of the neighbouring zones.
cooperation among *Europa and *Turquía #can be an example *alentador and hopeful on how cultures that are neighbouring and that coexist #can find road conjoint to reach peace, democracy and right State to the equal that opportunities of welfare for inhabitants.
In this sense, pray to the European Parliament that *nos concede the possibility to talk of a credible mood with *Turquía, to contribute *creíblemente to that produce changes in *Turquía and here includes that we fulfil also really commitments contracted in front of this country.
The Presidency #finnish has considered the peace process in Orient Next like #one of the most important subjects of the common politics of the Union in matter of external subjects and security.
Recognise the crucial paper of States Joined that have struggled during so much time and with *tanta tenacity to carry peace to this afflicted region; and *rindo a warm homage to said efforts - for example, to the capacity negotiator and to the determination of State Secretary.
In this sense, President *Arafat and Prime minister #Barak already have signed the memorandum for the application of the Agreement of *Wye *River and restart negotiations on the final situation.
Receive with satisfaction the statement of the Palestinian Authority, in the sense that it will adopt measured to combat terrorism, whereas Prime minister #Barak has recognised with informal character that will try to limit the expansion of settlements.
#If embargo, to hour to defend the right of self-determination, consider that #all parts have to be exhorted to employ in depth especially against terrorism to end to guarantee security of villages.
Like this, serious obstacles to reach a just peace, like the constant establishment of colonies #jewish in #palestinian territories or contempt of it that *Jerusalén #This means for Palestinians, #arab and Muslims in general, have filled of difficulties the path to peace, concept that do not has to be defined like the mere absence of war.
The European Parliament - the only institution of the EU that it is chosen directly by citizens - neither was consulted in moment during the two years that lasted negotiations on the content of the Agreement.
According to the French, is evident that #if they still register every year 3.000 cases of "crazy cows" in Realm Joined, in spite of #all caution measures that have been taken, follows existing, in transmission of illness, *algún element that still has not been able to explain.
Thus, this precise country of a maximum support, as the new Government has shown how #can provide stability with a #european spirit in #one of the most dangerous regions of the world.
After the celebration of meeting, will inform immediately on the details of resolutions there taken and will communicate posture of the Council to Industry Commissions, External Trade, Investigation and Energy.
In the agricultural plane, orientations of the European Council of *Berlín on Diary 2000 *nos offer a solid base to make, in matter of liberalisation, progresses compatible with the agricultural model European.
But there #be also #some other open questions in cooperation among the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, by #another, in the frame of the Round of #Millenium.
Thus, it is necessary to create for the countries in roads of development some better conditions of access to the market suppressing to time #all subventions to export of the EU for the agricultural products.
*Me seems shameful that have had to accept that countries in roads of development and that take part *contractualmente in the frame of this debate and that see especially affected, #can not be seated not even to the table negotiator by financial reasons and that the participation of the public opinion was so small.
This model, based in the community preference, guarantees the quality of products, the alimentary security, the survival and the expansion of our agricultural sectors and *agroalimentario.
Regarding the sanitary and educational problems, do not think and do not wish to put in cloth of objective trial of public politics in these fields to title of it that proposes in the field of service liberalisation in the next Round.
East run over has to see like attack against freedom of expression and the boundless right of citizens to culture, that do not has *parangón neither in the EU neither in the other democratic countries.
The Council considers that they are States members the that they have to commission to mitigate the social consequences of the suppression of the free sales of taxes and the problems that #can arise in the border zones.
In the cases in that the Presidency have had the intention to celebrate public meetings, but have not reached it, how States members are the that, with opposition, have put fetters to transparency?
Gentleman President, are once again to conflict of interests, #can call it like this, among the principle of territorial integrity of States and the principle of self-determination of villages.
And is precise and urgent that take #all measures to disposal so that they reestablish the human rights in the region, so that refugees have #all the humanitarian help that require and so that, finally, #can return to homes because it has reestablished peace.
Really is to sin by excess of credulity the imagine that the #british Government #can not have interrupted delivery of fight planes that got to destination #one those that hours before the #indonesian strengths killed at least to five demonstrators in *Yakarta.
And ask to the Commission that employ in depth to apply these goals, with the end to convert to *Europa in the world-wide homeland of the political action against death pity.
To time, Parliament has to give his decided support to action and watch so that in the future reach compulsory agreements in Gin in #all the situations that have relation with the human rights, in addition to fulfilling the resolution that expect that it approve in New *York in the autumn.
Like this as, is also way to reaffirm, in this sense, the importance to legislate definitively, to level of Nations Joined, on the abolition of death pity.
Have listened the debate of today and consider it like a very wise contribution and very *sobria to the achievement of hopes that, to trial, #can make with it that *yo #would designate a "soft landing" for Indonesian and for #all the populations of Indonesian.
No *me remains more remedy that say today that we also have to leave to throw fault to workers, workers to those who radiation has sentenced to death like consequence of the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry.
But in *Tokaimura, the own #japanese authorities have recognised that the security procedures, so much in conversion plant as in production facilities of fuel, have not respected.
orientation to the soft energy and to sources of renewable energies gives to know increasingly like the only solution to the energetic problem of society *postindustrial.
The questions referents to inspection of fuel in plant *MOX of *Sellafield are of the *incumbencia of the national authorities and have been notified to inspection services of nuclear facilities of Realm Joined.
The #irish Government has prepared a Green Book on the sustainable energy that will occupy a special place in our National Plan of Development for the period 2000-2006.
Understand that it is important for the House, is important for the institution of the European Parliament be once again to the height of demands of the #european citizens, demands that have expressed of mood very *nítido lately and, of course, during the last #european elections.
Gentleman President, always have been quite skeptical in front of attitudes *moralistas or police that even boost complaint, for the *cuales frauds avert only through the creation of instruments of control of the increasingly evident persons.
In the present case are in front of a new technological reality and social that #can configure *jurídicamente from the principle by means of legislation *originariamente #european and with the that to time *nos #can accredit of a special way like #european juridical community.
An ancient applicable example here is that #if the laws of States members demand simultaneous presence, then will not be possible for couple marry by means of signature type through network.
For #many of *nosotros, and *me surprises that Mrs. *Thors have not mentioned it, #this is a stimulating phenomenon, *igualador and *liberador because the ancient world was dominated by the great centres and the peripheries were in a situation *desventajosa in relation with the centres.
With the directive on conditions mark for the electronic signature the European Union gives an important step to the elimination of obstacles to the electronic trade.
Regarding term, seems reasonable, taking into account delay that is with this directive, that expand for mopeds of 1 January to 1 July 2002, so that it have a bit of time of adaptation of industry.
Regarding the called question of the offices of technical assistance, the big reform proposed by Parliament maybe have not been still sufficiently *ponderada so that it #can make in the field of the budget for the exercise 2000.
Have noted that also the European Parliament has intention to propose assignments that surpass the maximum limit of category 4 and thinks to take it so that it was possible to put assignments to disposal of actions in *Timor Oriental and in *Turquía that need finance and also to concretise fishing agreement with *Marruecos.
The Commission *me has entrusted that *les communicate that the Commission goes to propose another solution, that will take in consideration so much the need to establish political priorities like the principle of budgetary discipline.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, relations among the Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development and Budget Commission during preparation works of the Budget have not developed never without tensions.
Are had to endow to the Commission of the necessary resources to fund the administrative tasks and of management of #all these projects #if it guarantees the owed participation of Parliament in reflections on reform.
*Permítanme that remember also it that has manifested the colleague #Perry: programs *plurianuales, as #SOCRATES and *LIFE, answer in fact to the expectations of citizens and have to guarantee quality and *dotarlos of the necessary resources like part of development processes and of #european integration.
Also wanted to give the thanks to #all members of the different commissions that *nos have taken to get aspirations and that in his greater part have manifested a big understanding in front of the fact that, *cuando *nos move in a frame limited, although things are desirable, no #all are possible.
The Budget of the European Union for the exercise 2000 has a special character, no only because it began to examine it the ancient Parliament and afterwards reached an Agreement *interinstitucional, that is *vinculante bear *nosotros, in the that we also take part and that accepted to keep after the elections.
Of way that my Group do not defends an imprudent increase of costs of the Union, more important *nos seems, #if it is necessary, which occurs clearly in this case, use the *margen of increase of costs authorised by the agreements signed among the own States members.
#If rigour budgetary prevails so much in the field of States as of the Union, #this answers especially here to claims of #some countries members and know that the first victim of rigour will be the common agricultural politics.
Therefore, owe *asegurarnos no only that it have the owed coherence among the agencies that work on terrain, but also, lady Speaker of the Council, that not adopting decisions that suppose to spend money pointlessly by a decision of the Council to move to persons to place to 100 miles of distance.
No *nos fits the lower doubt that it will be possible to consign new resources for finance of *Kosovo, but instead consider that measures -*Turquía, fishing Agreement with *Marruecos- have to fund in the frame of costs at present foreseen in the Budget.
In effect, note more stood out of this budget *estriba in the self-evident insufficiency of assignments to confront determined goals, as in category *IV, "external Politics and cooperation", is in the that insufficiency self-evident of form more evident.
Is the *primer budget that goes to brush the 100 *millardos of euros #if they adopt the amendments *Bourlanges and, talking of gentleman *Bourlanges - that it is the financial of "cabin of uncle #Jean *Monnet" -, is his *primer inform after the general report, after the of lady *Dührkop, of gentleman *Tillich, of gentleman *Lamassoure or #others.
Have set up an initiative -and want to highlight it very clearly- that it also proposes to look for a flawless solution for the management of the budgetary resources that we have to administer directly from Parliament, among the *cuales want to stand out in particular trip costs.
Gentleman President, the speaker and #some of orators that *me have preceded already have alluded, obviously, to the that for me is #one of the crucial political elements -#if no the crucial element- of budget project.
Since it initiated creation politics of an economic space liberalised to scale world-wide is a massive transfer of resources of the poor to the rich, so much inside society as among States.
Think in the importance to increase the popular base in activities of the Union and that *nos concentrate in transcendental subjects as, for example, in combating unemployment and in enlargement to the new countries candidates.
The humanitarian help for the victims of war or for refugees in *Kosovo, for the victims of the earthquakes in *Turquía and for the innocent victims in *Timor Oriental, are obvious requirements that take to the European Union.
Gentleman President, with this debate the European Parliament has the opportunity to exert of consistent form affirmation of will regarding the future of the European Union.
links among the competent commission regarding bottom and Budget Commission #would not have to interrupt with the first reading of Parliament, after the *cual #can pass still *algún time until the subject remain finally resolved.
Without embargo, #would not have to forget the goals of the European Union. The most important is efficiency of our budgetary lines from sight point of employment.
The Commission will propose, therefore, that use the three instruments, to know: redistribution of credits, the instrument of the flexibility clause and a review of the financial perspectives.
Therefore, *le will ask, lady Commissioner, that have to well, with colleagues and in the terms that consider appropriate, concretise commitments that finishes to assume, with the end that we #can vote Thursday with total knowledge of cause and on the base of clear commitments that exclude misunderstanding among *nosotros.
By the contrary, the *SEBC has to have vision of #all the zone of the euro when taking assessment of the economic situation in general and of the stability panorama of prices in particular.
In the first place, in stability surroundings of prices, the mechanism of the market will assign form resources more effective to his more productive uses.
The clear division among performance competitions that finish to describe reinforces the credibility of the monetary and economic politics in *Europa, increases transparency and facilitates the democratic responsibility.
Besides, in operations that save relation with politics of coin only, taking organs of decisions of the *SEBC will occupy to value #if the planned operations with compatible with the goal of the monetary stability.
#Can that it reach stability goals of prices, but without opening will not be clear #if said goal has reached by design and, therefore, will be able to repeat in the future, or by a lucky accident that it #can demand then the introduction of #any improves in work methods.
In a democratic juridical order, the institutional and political independence of an institution only is possible #if to time also is guaranteed his *legitimación democratic, and #this demands transparency of the decisions, but also that #this are comprehensible.
*Yo have the *convencimiento that collaboration in a climate of confidence among #ECB and Parliament also #can contribute to boost security and confidence of the public opinion.
To avert #this Group proposes amendment that calls attention of the Central Bank European on mandate that is the to ensure stability of prices in the two senses.
Gentleman *Duisenberg, *sucede *usted like this without embargo - although the scarce assistance that today have do not seems to go in the sense of my words - to the emperors and to the popes that from #Charlemagne have dreamed with *reunificar our continent by means of faith or of strength.

Gentleman President, the European Central Bank continuous being an institution that takes decisions of crucial importance for millions of citizens of the European Union, without being subject to any democratic control and politician.
A sinking of the credibility of the Bank or the belief that #this #would not be had to follow politics *antiinflacionista at all costs #can have grave economic repercussions in the group of the Union.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Central Bank European, the annual report of #ECB shows that activity of the bank initiated to good rhythm and that the steps given until this moment go in the correct direction.
Is necessary to remember that, although in the zone of the euro practise an only monetary politics, follow having eleven economic politics different, #whose coordination *incumbe to States members, inside the frame established in the Stability Pact and Growth.
On a long-term basis, the Commission will develop a coherent strategy for the grey zone, is to say, the zone comprised among the humanitarian help and cooperation to development more on a long-term basis and directed to the future.
#Many have asked as a result of work in this field -no only THROW and the humanitarian help- #if  "we do not put car in front of horse" when insisting in celebrating quickly some elections.
While the military capacity of the violent increases, in big part thanks to moneys of drug trafficking, the civil population asks that *le apart from conflict, as it has understood that *ella is now the big affected and are his fundamental rights the that they violate day after day.
Have said and want to repeat it in front of *ustedes: today drug trafficking is the worst and the *primer enemy of peace, and #this will not reach totally without the dismantlement of the organisations that devote to the damned business of drug and without that we reach alternative and economic sustainable solutions and socially.
*Ustedes represent to those who have opted by life, by peace and by defence of the human rights; *ustedes are expression of those who believe in democracy, in freedom and in a healthy environment for the next generations.
The lessons of *Bosnia and *Kosovo reinforce conviction that it suits to persist in the explanation of our intentions, as we expect that *suceda until the end of the common year, in particular in the frame of the preparation of the budget for the year 2000.
Wail that have not been so frequent the presence of the Council in the commissions of Parliament, because *ello *nos had helped to be able to to debate and *conocernos better and to be able to advance jointly.
Colony Council entrusted to the #finnish Government, like title of the Presidency, establish the necessary conditions for the execution of this project to time for the Summit of *Tampere.
Like president of the Commission of Juridical Subjects and Rights of Citizens, wanted to suggest to President in exercise that concede greater recognition to paper of Parliament to hour to treat with citizens.
A space of justice will give form and foundation to the *tercer *pilar and will allow a more intense fight against delinquency organised in #all his tragic facets: traffic of women and of boys, pederasty, corruption of minors, production and traffic of drugs, exploitation of prostitution, boosted #all *ellos by the illegal immigration in these last time.
Wail that already have separated to defence associations of the human and antiracist rights, #as well as the social speakers, of the preparation of this letter.
In #all these fields, the Commission #would have to take the initiative to end to reach a more complete configuration of diary, and Parliament has to prepare to exert paper that *le suits.
Nevertheless, change has to get no only for the three pending subjects of *Amsterdam, the extension of the vote by qualified majority, the size of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council.
The *segunda reforms fundamental is the elimination of the national veto of cooperation clauses reinforced; and the third will be to concede to citizenship the right to access directly to the European Court.
It same is applicable to article 105 of the Treaty of the *CE, so that #ECB have mandate politically established *contractualmente to boost with his monetary politics growth and employment.
Of course, when reading it gives #one explains that they do not mention neither dreams, neither the goals, neither the challenges with the that it finds the European Union of face to the century *XXI; but, at least, give #some lines general guidelines related with a series of questions of institutional character that have to be regulated.
The inner circle #would be formed by a #european federation, composed by States members of the Union that are more advanced in integration: #that that are members of NATO and belong also to the zone of the euro.
Tomorrow will travel to *Kosovo with Gift #Javier Adret to evaluate personally performance, therefore will have of the opinions of Parliament to support my clear *convencimiento of the need to set up the Agency it before possible.
Expect that Parliament comprise that we do not have *escatimado efforts to find commitment solution to this subject so extremely important and expect that we #can work with the Council of mood that deserve the approval of Parliament.
The #european delegation of the *PvdA in front of the European Parliament, and #some #others, have encouraged in the past for reaching disposal of Parliament to the adoption of commitments and will continue it taking.
The *SP will continue struggling in the new European Parliament by a just statute, that have a transparent system of diets based in costs effected and, therefore, agrees with the proposals that the Council has made on this subject.
Is necessary to leave that protection systems develop it more effectively possible through market agents, and, simultaneously, it is necessary to procure that it keep confidence of citizens in the possibilities of the digital signature.
In view of situation difference, fears much more that the #others exploitation of his internal conflicts by #such or *cual of the countries members and, to remedy this danger, sees forced to be two times less transparent.
Have talked with persons on the subject and believe that society #would receive with satisfaction a greater capacity to act against the international delinquency and crime organised that crosses borders in proportions every time greater.
space, that arises linked to advance of the suppression of the called "inner borders" of the EU and to the strengthening of his "external borders", #can not transform to the EU in fortress.
repeats with frequency, *Señorías: progress only costs #if it is shared and *eso comports for *nosotros that in a world in constant mutation leave to take that *recaigan efforts and essential sacrifices on employees for afterwards take that the richest and the most powerful benefit *prioritariamente of the positive effects of said efforts and sacrifices.
His *provocador announcement situates in the frame of an authentic gangrene that #can not leave that it develop without reacting, #if we do not want to renounce *nosotros same to control #any of the economic and social development and, therefore, to the ambition to promote, in full *mundialización, a social model European.
carries the #sad -palm palm- *Renault, that, when clearing without *miramientos work places in *Nissan, satisfies to shareholders, even to risk to export to the *Japón the image more *detestable of *Europa, no without suppressing, of *carambola, varied thousands of places of work in the own European Union.
Even in the cases in that they exist right in the #european legislation, rights, for example, to be consulted with the owed *antelación on decisions of collective dismissals and other important changes that affect to lives of workers, the law do not fulfils or do not applies as it is had to.
This violent expression of contempt of employees and of life contradicts fundamentally the goals announced in *pro of employment, of the social and territorial cohesion and of the social model European.
has mentioned the banking sector, that is #one of the problems that go to have in front of *nosotros but, clear, *Europa has a big history and experience in restructurings, that begin from the textile and naval industry and get until the current industries.
No *escatimaremos efforts to convince to Congress of the importance that has the Treaty of total prohibition of the nuclear proofs for *nosotros, for States Joined and for the international efforts directed to the no proliferation.
irresponsibility has supposed a hard hit for #all the international efforts directed to prevent diffusion of arms and plants to the nuclear disarmament in front of a grave crisis.
But the entrance in vigour of this Treaty in the #EE.UU #would have subjected to pressure to regional nuclear powers to adhere to the Treaty. For example, Indian and *Pakistán, that are his regional balance of terror, or *Corea of the North or will Go, *Irak or #Israel.
suspicion that have precisely the emergent or regional powers of the *Tercer World that the Treaty of *Non *Proliferation serves in first line to the *aseguramiento of the nuclear reservations of the great and that discriminates to the small, obtains new wings like consequence of the failure of the Treaty on Nuclear Essays in the #EE.UU.
Wanted to say some words on #this and *centrarme later in brief in other two subjects that have dominated conversations: the application of the Association Agreement and Cooperation and enlargement of the European Union to the North.
These obstacles include certification and some requirements of excessive proofs, #as well as specific problems like the maintenance of taxes that have to pay the international aerial companies by *sobrevolar *Siberia.

To finalise example list, *me will refer to connection among *Larkhall in *Lanarkshire and program #french, in the that youngsters have collaborated in the construction of lane bike in the south of *Escocia.
Therefore, the reference to paper of family believe that it #would have to include in program Youth of the European Community, that aspires to analyse factors that boost or hamper the social integration of youngsters.

Is necessary to be speaker to know until how point rhythm *infernal of this procedure disturbs the general life of the group of collaborators of the Secretariat of Budget Commission, and believe that it is necessary to be conscious of *ello.
Lo and behold, in #few words, a triple irregularity: no exist political parties Europeans; do not establishes any public contribution in favour and the Commission do not has right to prepare said statute, contrary to the Treaty.
Inside reduction logic generalised of credits awarded to help to development, the European Community is and has to continue being the main partner of the most disadvantaged countries.
(THE) So much the preliminary draft of the Commission as especially budget project of the EU for the exercise 2000 presented by the Council characterise by the strict austerity and by the drastic cuts, even in relation with it agreed in the Council of *Berlín.
Exists a clear need to trace a distinction among the subjects of direction organs, that are responsibility of the Table, and the subjects that *atañen to deputies, that are responsibility of Plenary.
This fact causes intense restlessness on the profusion of nuclear arms, on climbing *armamentística in determined regions of the world and on update of arms of massive destruction.
The last disclosures on the propagation of arms and nuclear heads to third countries that do not constitute nuclear powers, and, of course, with ignorance of villages, confer new and hair-raising dimensions to the danger of nuclear catastrophe.
Guarantee specifications of quality and security of the highest grade in the transport of dangerous commodities by railway has to be the main care of initiative legislative of the European Union in this sector.
To this *respecto wanted to manifest my gratitude to President of the Commission, Mr. *Prodi, by obstinacy that puts in this subject, *confiriéndole place *prioritario in government program of the Commission.
To the remit the matter *substantiva of the regulation *IFOP to a regulation of application, the Commission took that fishing went the only sphere in the agricultural and structural sector that did not decide in the *primer semester of this year.
The opinion expressed on 30 September 1999 by *AFSSA, relative to the lifting of the prohibition of exports of bovine meat and bovine products *provenientes of Realm Joined, is *desfavorable because it bases in arguments related with scientific questions and of control.
The Agreement of #Florencia, to the that got State Bosses and of Government of the EU on 21 June 1996, establishes six previous conditions that Realm Joined has to fulfil before it raise the prohibition to export meat of bovine.
citizens #british expect that *Francia respect the #european legislation, and also expect that the European Commission act with decision to finish with the illegal prohibition of meat exports of bovine #british.

subsidiariness imposes, as, the urgent need to recognise that States have the right to go against of harmonisation measure *cuando propose to adopt norms more protective in matter of public health, as also of environment.
Afterwards, some weeks later, the European Commission imposed the embargo and recognised that the #german States had had reason. Without embargo, the European Commission had, obviously, yielded to a political biology.
Consider, instead, that has to ask to the Commission and to the other competent community Institutions that inform on it made regarding #the same, so as to allow to Parliament formulate critical assessments that they are *propedéuticas of face to the improvement of the valid community legislation in the matter.
Regarding inspection, share the opinion of those who have expressed here wish that control level was similar in #all *Europa, alleging that no suffices with implant only a system of effective control in Big *Bretaña.
By #everything *ello, and expecting that, #such as it requests the report of Mr. *Cunha, the Commission inform to Parliament of the result of the application of this Protocol, Group, gentleman President, asks the approval of the Report *Cunha.
Gentleman President, the excellent report of Mr. *Cunha has deserved my full support, since it takes special upsetting in the principle of the sustainable performance that #can not be missing in fishing politics oriented to the future.
In his *dictamen, the Managerial Committee Scientist confirmed that no had need to examine the decision to raise the prohibition of meat exports of bovine of Realm Joined.
No *le seems that, in principle, the suitable measure in front of shoot of *EEB -and the path that #would have to have followed from the *primer moment, from optics of a preventive protection of consumers- #would have to be separation and sacrifice of herds infected?
It that it wanted to that Commissioner reiterated so only once again here and now, so that it remain totally clear, is his *convencimiento that delay goes to be of only days and that foresees that this process will have concluded, to more take, Tuesday of session period of *Estrasburgo and -to be possible- before.
strength like the of the Popular Party European-Democrat #can not agree with #this, because it aims to the free operation of the market that carries to the free distribution of incomes, especially from incomes of workers.
Inland revenue Ministers appear in front of the Commission of Economic Subjects of the European Parliament and the social speakers appear also in front of the European Parliament.

These three proposals -the agreement, the directive on the labour day of persons of the sea and the Agreement of the *OIT- go to go in in vigour to time, around the middle of the year 2002.
In the first place, concerning workers, exclusion of the independent workers of the definition will subject to group to rigours without palliative of the original directive on the labour day.
His labour modalities depend of factors out of control, #such as the climatological conditions and movements of fishes, by it that results difficult to imagine how #can apply limitations of the labour day in this sector.
Ladies and gentlemen deputies, believe that the most important subject and more difficult for the group of conciliation, to get to *algún result, goes to be the problem of the directive on doctors, on the that have talked previously.
respects article of the previous directive, according to the *cual fishermen that work by own account are subject to the national legislations regarding permissions and to the election of work conditions.
#This will apply especially to the improvement of the environmental protection and to limitation of the negative effects of growth and of urbanisation in the welfare of village #chinese.
By means of the scientific and technological cooperation also will be possible to promote the *aprovechamiento of the enormous natural resources of part *noroccidental of *Rusia, the *cuales will have a big importance in the future economic development, so much of *Rusia as of the Union.
The fault of clarity in the nuclear field and restlessness in front of this subject #would be really sufficient to formulate reservation and say, for example, that want that agreements conclude to time.
With regard to other possible cooperations, have to follow a logical order of priorities, beginning, as it has proposed, by the countries members of the quoted area, is to say, *Paraguay, *Uruguay, *Brasil and Argentinian, and continuing by countries associated -*Chile, *Bolivia, etc.-, with the *cuales, as #all know, the European Union finds in conversation stage for association *interregional.
Announcements in exhibition hall in the that they mention data of #all car models that sell in #the same. Likewise, have to mention fuel consumption and CO2 broadcasts *cuando take advertising on the new cars, also.
A second point to the that has to loan attention in the review is that Parliament requested that the directive also out of application in the case of cars of *segunda hand, of director cars and of vehicles with permission of circulation of day.
While in *Bonn #others try to evade responsibility and deny to reduce CO2 broadcasts, *nosotros adopt effective instruments, adopt legislative disposals and offer to consumer the possibility to reduce personally CO2 broadcasts
The possibilities that involves this approach so only finish to begin to appear in the field quickly *cambiante of the electronic trade, for example in relation with the resolution procedures of conflicts in line.
The national markets of the countries candidates will have to integrate in the community without shaken and, in consequence, will be necessary to foresee, in case, transitory measures by #if said countries were not prepared; without embargo, our goal has to be the of *ayudarles to be prepared from the following day to the of adhesion.
Likewise, term that finalises Thursday of the previous week to the week in that it transacts the question, since the questions transact Tuesday, supposes at all less that eight working days, which exceeds of any interpretation.
The opinion of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Subjects and of Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities find added to this Report *nº 2 of the agenda of today.
. (*SV) Gentleman President, lines guidelines of employment for the year 1999 take upsetting in that the ideas on equality of opportunities for men and women have to form part of #all the action plans and measures that propose in the field of the four *pilares of employment strategy of the EU.
The fact that conditions are complicated remains shown because with frequency agreement and convergence in these goals #can finish by *desmoronarse to hour to define therapies, performance strategies.
No *me seems, without embargo, that the Committee of the Regions take part in the assessment of performances of States with a view to tackle politics of employment to scale local that entrust, frequent and exclusively, to activism and to the will of the social speakers.
So that I believe that they have to be more diligent in the Commission so that, as it says in my country, "no *le give cat by hare" and to see #if, at last, in the year 2000 have criteria and levels to measure *cualitativamente and no only *cuantitativamente our goals, means and our results.
Of course, fits to criticise politics followed until here, especially actions *nos lacking tenacity, *nos is missing to struggle against exclusion of workers of more age, and are that in #all States members, even in *Suecia, women do not take part the same that men in the productive field.
Gentleman President, the proposal of the relative Commission to lines guidelines for employment politics in the year 2000 do not introduces novelty with regard to the previous documents.
The fact to recognise it do not supposes to delete competitions of States members, but sustain that, in a more wide and coherent vision of the problematic occupational, #can act with greater efficiency to resolve #one of the greater problems of time.
Besides, approximation of the economic politics of the countries of the zone of the euro, derived of the common monetary politics, makes possible research of the best models, or was, the called *bench-*marking.
Gentleman President, the report of Mr. *Menrad *me seems very correct *cuando assigns to modernisation of work a fundamental paper to increase productivity, competitiveness and, therefore, employment.
Lady Speaker, wanted to inform to his *Señorías that in fact has suppressed practically article 51 of the Regulation that allows to deputies sign statements written that, in the case that they had been subscribed by the majority of deputies, transmit to the Institutions mentioned in the own statements.
since *me *opongo by principle to fixation of dip quantitative in employment strategy have not given backrest to the goal to reduce remuneration differences in a determined percentage inside five years (amendment 22).
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to examine the definite project of agenda established, of compliance with article 110 of the Regulation, by the Conference of Presidents (in the meeting of Thursday 11 November).
The ministries of environment have taken very to chest the proposal of parliament and now is #ours to have to demand to industry an equal attitude of firm in relation to nitrogen broadcasts.
Have taken great progresses in the last years, regarding the solution of these problems, for example with the systems installed in cars that already have visited 80.000 kilometres and manufactured takes more of five years, to control the length of squad *anticontaminación.
Gentleman President, in my intervention wanted to underline the fundamental paper exerted by the European Parliament, in particular by Right Commission of Woman and Equality of Opportunities, in plough to debate today, expect, the definite approval of program.
Had a very deep debate with the executive Commission especially regarding modification of the juridical foundation and, therefore, to the reduction that have discerned in the proposal in comparison with the proposal *originaria.
For example, is not violence force to women, to family mothers, to fulfil nocturnal turns in production chains for *rentabilizar better machines and increase the benefits of shareholders?
Gentleman President, want to give the thanks to Mrs. *Avilés by this report, as it has put in hands a tool more to proceed against violence exerted on women and boys, but also, especially, to show how and where takes place violence.
The Commission already is the initiative *Daphne to combat violence against teenagers and boys, and to #this will follow, as we have seen in the previous debate, program *Daphne 2000-2003.
States members, in the next review of the Treaties have to adopt a clear legal base on the Treaties of the EU to favour the interests of boy.
And in place of the solutions *ortopédicas or *represivas, #would be moment to prefer the preventive solutions, that believe a different familiar context, it that #would allow finally avert individual and social suffering useless and practise a true politics of insertion and of socialisation from the birth.
Believe that the suitable forum for the debate of the perspectives of consecration of a fundamental right of boys has to be #the same that for the Letter of the fundamental rights.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the oral question (*B5-0034\/1999) of Mr. *Rocard, in name of Employment Commission and Social Subjects, on information and query of workers of the European Union.
The European Parliament has approved a series of amendments oriented first of all to specify modalities and the definition of information and query, especially regarding moment in that information has to be transmitted.
With #everything, *me seems that the attempt of *instrumentalizar also in Plenary a political battle that the left is in #Italia against parity of the educational system is absurd and incompatible with works of Parliament.
The speaker applies some questionable criteria, for example accuse to the Commission of having limited to apply the guidelines of the Council.
In report, Mrs. *Haug takes well in checking the arbitrary changes introduced *subrepticiamente by the Commission by means of a mathematical operation relative to the maximum limit of own resources.
Characteristic of this reinforcement is the preventive character of measures proposed, that expresses a new conception and materialises in a parallel increase of management powers of the European Commission.
Go to go in in some very difficult negotiations and in the frame of negotiations float again in the air some figures of the that #all are not so convinced that they are really a suitable base.
Now that the sustainable development is a goal of the treaty, also #would be logical that incorporated an articulate on energy in the Treaty that facilitate an integral approach of energy and the environment.
The amendment 3 signals that with the application of the nuclear energy, apart from a possible reduction of CO2, go in in game other environmental effects, as they are storage of the radioactive waste.
Until week past, the Commission was had to present a proposal of new community directive that #would establish drastic limitations to the diets of national helps to the renewable energies.
To face up to these challenges and win contradictions, precise, as, very fast, #one *concertación to #all levels, in States and with the countries candidates, adhere to the countries candidates to the European Union and work in the context of the *Quinto Programs Frame.
In the summit of *Helsinki, that will celebrate in December, Government Bosses will tackle the subject of integration of the environment and of the durable development in different sectorial politics, and of special way energy.
*Me surprises even more the fact that transports by road remain excluded of the field of application of the Directive that limits work time and reservations manifested on this subject regarding workers "*off-*shore".
Share also the criterion of *Wallis, Group colleague, in the sense that we have to follow advancing, by part, supporting amendments and, by #another, expect that Commissioner discover new possibilities of advance in this matter to the light of the Summit of *Tampere., Take like example the *litigios by foods.
#would Be easy, for the Court of Justice, contribute a definition to the notion of parental responsibility independently of the existence of a common matrimonial right, it that do not wishes, neither foresees at present?
No fits doubt that *subsistirán important problems, especially the subject of disparity of the applicable rights to divorce and to consequences, but this regulation is only #one first stage and congratulate to the speaker by this initiative.
Also suit in that, in the case of countries that depend to a large extent of the nuclear head offices for electricity and energy, is essential that *escalone the execution of closing programs to end to give time so that it have of substitutive capacity.
Signalled that, #if there #be derogation that *nos allow to set up fulfillment of commitments contracted in May of 1998, #would reach a global attack against property expropriation, no only in Tub, #where May agreement of 1998 received attacks very strong.
Is of interest for #all that it have derogation of the Title 4, is of interest for #all, included the possible investors, that no have a commercial difference that no only frightens off investment, but that, besides, poisons our global relations.
Have to say that *me inspires confidence that #Sergio Scallop of *Mello go to be administrator of Nations Joined in *Timor Oriental: is person with the that worked closely in my previous charge, in *Hong *Kong, to tackle the problem of refugees and of the illegal immigrants.
In directive valid #can find #all the instruments for a correct management of nitrogen in the fields and in the hydrographic basins, in what it apply adequately in #all the agriculture zones and *ganadería intensive of *Europa.
So that they are not necessary new provisional directives neither the review of the valid; it that takes fault is to increase pressures to reach his effective application in the vulnerable zones and in level of exploitations *agropecuarias.
For the #others seven countries, among the that it finds #Italia, *nos remains, from the proposals received in my services, for verifying, country by country, that zone map proposed correspond sure enough to the group of the criteria of the Regulation of the Structural Bottoms.
As always, permission demanded determined commitments by part of company, commitments allocated to guarantee the real recovery of company and to reduce the repercussions in competition and inside the only market.
Gentleman President, the Commission knows perfectly the importance that has reform of the systems of social security of the countries candidates in the context of adhesion to the EU.
. Lady Speaker, *Señorías, is a big pleasure for me and a big honour appear in front of Plenary of Parliament in my new quality of General Secretary of the Council and High Representative of the Union for the External Politics and of Common Security.
request, regarding questions of human rights, has obtained an answer that *me *atrevería to describe of *alentadora, with confirmation that they have *cursado invitations to the no governmental organisations active in the field of the human rights so that they visit *Argelia.
Create, lady Speaker, *Señorías, that the debate of Monday revealed likewise that ministers wish that the Union endow of the suitable means to evaluate the crisis and have of procedures also suitable and clear for the taking of decisions in case that it was necessary to act.
But the Commission yes has means and the necessary experience to make an important contribution to the no military dimension of security.
Want to appreciate likewise to presidents of the Groups the agreement reached Thursday of the past week so as to that the European Commission, represented in occasion by #Chris *Patten, also #can take part in the session of today.
By #this affirm that the Assembly of the Western European Union, that has fulfilled an important paper in the past, has to transfer these tasks to the European Parliament chosen by direct suffrage.
Said #this, want *recalcar again - and fortunately already have taken it orators - that, in my opinion, strength of the European Union resides or #would have to reside in the management of the crisis and in conflict prevention.
This position is so surprising that *me ask #if *algún Minister has read the amendment and data, because #this results totally incomprehensible. Unless it was not truth the that #some suspect, #this is, that this position *moralista and *rigorista serves to take out of difficulties to #some great powers no especially interested by moratorium proposal.
Of course, like Europeans do not propose any additional army, capacity of autonomous action of the EU will limit mainly to the process of taking of political decisions.
#Can really *permitirnos strategic and financially endowment by duplicate of personnel and committees, the proliferation of #european strengths and waste and confusion to subject to strengths armed to two operative doctrines and diets of distinct planning?
Unless we correct look, #all the subject of the External Politics and of Common Security and of defence identity #european will not happen to be fantasy.
*Cuando begin to *ocuparnos of the crisis of *Bosnia had development in the military planning, in the deployment of strengths -remember that they deployed 60.000 soldiers in *Bosnia-, that was very by in front of the of the civil planning that it #would be necessary to have made.
Among #this figure, for example, the principle of caution, the need that #this define clearly, to be able to have a definition in line of the that adopted in the Conference of River on the Environment and Development.
Is necessary to improve transparency of said procedure, with the *cual have had repeatedly difficulties in the past, and #many of conflicts have been related with looks of the environmental politics, the protection of consumer and the protection of animals.
It that, for example, #can not repeat is that the #european restrictions to export are classified in the "green box" and, therefore, have to reduce in six years and credits #american to export, that have nature exactly, are not subjects to *imposición *restrictiva #any.
The opinion of the Commission of Social Subjects and Employment is unanimous: is necessary to support very especially integration in the world-wide economy of States that fulfil the social and environmental norms fundamental.
. -. (*FR) program *Daphne, #all *nosotros, deputies, have wished it, but also #all the organisations, the no governmental and #others, and associations that work in the delicate field of violence against boys, teenagers and women.
#If we created a #european tax, the Council will lose little by little means of resistance and go to give a decisive advantage to the institutions that look for an increase of the budget.
have increased the retentions until the 25 percent to end to compensate so much to *Bélgica as to the Low Countries by charge by costs that proceeded of the progressive replacement of the contribution of VAT by the contribution of the *PNB.
Second, the majority of persons (and believe that it is also the case in #all the European Union) recognise that it #would be a historical error begin the next century blocking to *Rusia of the #european subjects as we took to beginnings of this century.
Finally wanted to say that Mr. *Ivanov has suggested in conversations *conmigo that it #can be of utility an intensification of contacts among the European Parliament and the *Duma, included perhaps a visit to *Moscú of a group of representatives of his *Señorías.
Gentleman President, the last weeks have shown, #such as it finishes to expose orator that *me has preceded, that dimensions of conflict of the *Cáucaso are, in fact, considerable wider and #this extends also to the group of the zone of the sea *Caspio.
In this context, poses a debate and also a *interrogante of another totally distinct order. The European Parliament always has left clear in #all resolutions that *Chechenia forms part of the Russian Federation.
*Yo do not finish to comprise how is possible that a supposed Minister of External Subjects *autodesignado of *Chechenia, that of compliance with the international Right #can not exist, keep an official conversation with Speaker of the European Parliament.
Lady Speaker, *Señorías, gentleman Commissioner, the Liberal Group adopts a positive posture concerning the relative agreement to the reduction of the bilateral commercial barriers that reached Sunday Chinese and States Joined.
#This do not involves that we are in presence of the perfect market and, precisely by #this, knowing benefits and degenerations, have to treat, through agreements like the proposed by the World-wide Organisation of Trade, to create norms and rules with the end of *protegernos of excess type.
Lady Speaker, gentleman Commissioner, in an increasingly interdependent world, in the that the problems that *nos affect #be to have causes in #ours *antípodas, are forced to work together with the countries to manage adequately resources of the planet, respecting some rules that are common to #all.
But, #can not occur instead that diet strengthen by means of an economic growth that will benefit to the urban minorities but that will create *decenas of millions of new unemployed, without social security, *cuando dismantle brutally the state factories and simultaneously millions of peasants go to unemployment by the new competition in agricultural matter?
Second is precise to confine to the *OMC, limit of strict form paper and keep out of competition field sectors that put in game the same identity of societies and that they have to continue depending of sovereignty of citizens and of institutions chosen.
And, from sight point, reaffirm here respect need of the environmental questions, respect of consumer, respect of the human rights and the social rights.
Finally, stake is not trade without rules, but to the contrary, act of way that the formidable growth of trade serve to the durable development of #all and no to enrichment *predador of the strongest.
Owe *ocuparnos that it have spot for the social and ecological looks and for a gradual participation and directed of the countries of the *Tercer World in the world-wide economy in a world with a commercial traffic liberalised.
approval will be a clear signal regarding partners, that confirms that the European Union will not conform with approach *minimalista, oriented only to an improvement of access to the market in #some sectors.
The risk of paralysis of the legislative organs -the Council and Parliament- and of *inoperatividad of the Commission to apply legislation is a fundamental problem.
administration of fine justice and to time constitutes, after all, an essential part of #all Been of Right, and have to procure that in the European Union the essence of the procedure *prejudicial and the juridical protection general continue being guaranteed.
Other proposals that have suggested, #such as the request that the European Parliament take part in the election of judges and that competition of the Court of Justice has to extend to the called *tercer *pilar, are studied.
Finally, it is necessary to reach the introduction of a clear hierarchy of the juridical norms that allow a precise separation among #all the different legislative decisions and the decisions of application.
Alas, neither the two speakers neither the Commission of Institutional Subjects have wanted to accept the amendments of the Commission of relative Industry to the energetic politics and to the *Euratom.
#This is already a firm point that #all will have to take into account. Parliament and the Commission move in direction and are equally convinced that the Conference *Intergubernamental do not has to mark horizon limited, approach *reductivo, diary reduced.
Nobody #can neglect strengthening problems of the *Europa political and of institutional change that *nos have posed the birth of the euro and of the Central Bank European, the lesson of *Kosovo, the extended aspiration to space guaranteed of security and of justice, disenchantment of *demasiados citizen constituents.
As it has remembered president of our Commission, Mr. *Napolitano, no treats to resolve among maximalists and *minimalistas, it will be necessary to be perfectionist, without leaving to be progressive, regarding the future development of the European Union.
At the side of hit of the Monetary Union -*innegable- is necessary to advance also in the Political Union and in fields that expand competitions of the European Union to avert the existent asymmetries; *yo #would say the *clamorosas existent asymmetries.
The current method is quite exhausted but, anyway, #would be indispensable that the Council engaged to take into account the proposals that take in moment the Commission and Parliament of suitable way.
In this sense *me add to it that finishes to say . #would Have to include a review procedure less strict for the *segunda splits of the new configuration of the Treaties, in addition to incorporating a clause on cooperation reinforced in a *Europa of 27 or 30 countries.
In 1999, production grew with regard to the previous year more of the 100 by one hundred and has reached the greater volume of #all times, that estimates in some 4600 tonnes, and, in part, #this is consequence of the remarkable increase of the surface devoted to crop of opium.
As it already has said the author of the question, activities in *Afganistán see hampered by the wide base of the government of the country, and, therefore, by the fault of a suitable partner that deserve credibility.
Wanted to ask to President in exercise of the Council that *me confirm #if information relative to how country voted in how felt do not facilitates *cuando the Council issues press communiqués at the end of meeting of the Council.
According to the general program of the Regulation of the Council 793\/93 on assessment and control of the risks of existent substances, at present there are three #fireproof products with bromine that are.
Other specific questions that formulate in this matter also will be of competition of the Commission, that like manager of the community politics, has the tools and the necessary information to give reliable answers and updated.
Of compliance with article 112 of the Regulation, the Group of the European Socialists and the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformers *me have requested the application of urgency procedure.
article 112 of Regulation remits to section 1 of article 60: "urgency of the debate of a proposal that was object of query to Parliament, according to section 1 of article 60...".
Had explains that the report of Mr. *Napolitano refers to a text of legislative character, believe that *nos situate in the frame of section 1 of article 60, to the that remits article 112 of the Regulation.
Step to the minimum norms. control politics like the that proposes here only is acceptable #if #all the countries apply some minimum norms in it that to the processing of asylum appeals refers.
No exists any elementary norm of juridical security regarding register procedure and to access to transmission of data of the that have States members and the Commission.
#Everything *ello *me carries to think that #some pretend to use the system *Eurodac maybe no exclusively but yes mainly to designate to a Been responsible member, that will have to load with the consequences of fraud in matter of illegal immigration and asylum, and do not seem to have interest in preventing this type of fraud.
Is important that comprise that, to time that promote prevention politics with goals on a long-term basis, will have to exert politics with goals more in the short term, as they are politics directed to repression of drug trafficking and to therapy and rehabilitation of the *drogodependientes, of luck that contribute to that prevention finish succeeding, or, at least, to that the situation stabilise.
By it that refers to the reduction of demand, programs and the preventive measures for boys and young, instead of centring exclusively in the illegal drugs, #would have to treat of addiction in general, with inclusion of looks of alcohol consumption and tobacco.
Finally, the *OLAF do not tackles the causes of corruption, that reside in the suppression of the national borders, it that allows that money of drug circulate freely, #as well as fraud and the financial delinquency.
Second, has awarded to the Commission a mandate of global negotiations regarding #all a series of questions, #some of the *cuales are of community competition, but #others, like services or investments, are clearly of national competition.
In any case, will be attentive to way in that the Commission negotiates, and although the tone of this report amended *nos seem still too much liberal, *nosotros, the Greens, *nos will convert in the more *encarnizados defenders of said text, #if Commissioner *Lamy descended underneath of the recommendations that here have taken.
But believe that #one of the most important facts in #day of this new round, and that the distinguishes of the previous, is irruption of the civil society, of the *ONG and of the international public opinion in the debate.
Is of doubt, on the other hand, of #where arises worry: the fact that, by not ending in point, are forced to not respecting commitments very ancient regarding the countries in roads of development, and especially in front of the countries *ACP, to the *cuales the agreements of *Lomé *nos link from twenty years ago.
But is evident that bear *eso there are roads, very distinct of the current and of the that trace, it that introduces in the agenda the need of a relative moratorium to negotiations on the international commercial relations.
On the other hand, nobody prevents to the countries in roads of development that carry out a suitable agricultural politics. Is to say, #can avert or reduce import of these cheap products that prejudice his own agriculture by means of exaction fixation to import.
The #european agriculture has suffered, during the years of the Round *Uruguay, the greater decrease of active population that have known never, it that has caused a true *desorganización of the rural world.
For the neutral states and no ranged the tasks of *Petersberg involve the possibility to take part in conflicts and in the handle of crisis and, by reason, there #be not reason to integrate totally to the *UEO in the European Union.
Like this, the protection of the fundamental rights of persons that it treat demands that it do not advance to the creation of a central system of control of personal data, as, by principle, #any of persons #can be treated like individual criminal or suspicious to be it.
The risk of a nuclear war *desatada by mistake was #one of reasons of the proposal of the Commission of *Camberra in the sense that the nuclear arms have to be prepared for his immediate use.
#Ours *segunda requirement to diminish the risk of nuclear war was that #all the nuclear arms #would have to disassemble of devices that the transport, to give like this sufficient time to the serious political negotiations.
Although element of the systems determinants for security result affected, systems, specifically #that that transmit information to operator, #can see affected and failure #can put in danger indirectly the nuclear security, when overloading to operators, as it has signalled.
In the first place, because they still exist *atropellos to the human dignity and to the human rights of the *timorenses that find refugees in zones of *Timor, in particular in *Timor western and that wish to return to *Timor Oriental and is necessary that the authorities of Indonesian facilitate urgently the humanitarian action, in particular of the no governmental organisations.
Already there #be an approximate calculation of reconstruction costs -250 millions of euros, in three years- and day 17 December will celebrate a conference of donors.
owes simple and *llanamente to that *nos concentrate in the economic help and *nos forget of the fundamental things like the exercise of tolerance, the exercise of democracy and support in the social field.
For *nosotros, the abolition of death pity is an intrinsic element of politics in matter of human rights, whereas for countries said question - #this is, at least, thesis - *incumbe exclusively to the criminal subjects.
Believe that the Commission and, with *ella, #all the European Union has taken to know, clearly, from the principle, that *nosotros condemned type of ethnic violence, without matter the one who went author and victim.
Now well, in this resolution *nos refer to an independent investigation, which *nos allows to express wish that parts involved and, therefore, the Government of *Burundi no limit to explain version of it occurred but that, apart from *eso, go out to the surface the facts.
Gentleman President, Mr. Commissioner, colleagues, have worked in *Ruanda and know the country from 1984, have been born in *Tanzanía and have lived in the country years, and talk the main #african language of the region of the Great Lakes of *África. Believe that I #can say, therefore, that talk of this question with experience and with knowledge of cause.
is not possible any national reconciliation without a true judicial treatment of this question, and #this *atañe so much to the #rwandan national justice as to the International Penal Court for *Rwanda.
*Nosotros consider that the complete resumption of cooperation saves relation with the results of the peace process, #as well as with instauration of a political and constitutional frame that conduct, finally, to democratisation.
The attempt to show that the current prime minister, *Sharif, takes part in a criminal conspiracy and has created nepotism system #can not convert in process simulation.
While *Pakistán do not gather #all the necessary conditions for the urgent and indispensable economic reforms, social and human will not be able to recover quality of member of the *Commonwealth neither will be able to benefit of cooperation agreement with the European Union.
First: #all *nosotros, progressive or conservative of Plenary, have to have clear, and believe that we have it, that the approach of drug politics has to split always of a budget: the *drogodependientes do not need by principle of pity and persecution, but of help and of support.
The past week, President of the Commission signalled that it has developed in breast of the Union a "inner market for drug traffic".
The main problem of my report rooted in that to measure that passed work went taking more evident that the European Bank of Investments in it that concerns to the modern management of companies, to transparency and to work publicly finds certainly delayed.
In May of 1999, my predecessor, Mr. *Blak, Vice-president of the Commission of Budgetary Control, formulated 26 concrete questions about presumptive frauds, bad management, corruption and cover-up -have said "cover-up" -in activities of the Bank, operations of box included, along the period 1993-1998.
#can not follow reducing the "social costs" to fulfil with the criteria imposed to the national budgets by the Stability Pact, while they repeat beautiful words of social support that afterwards do not materialise in practice.
Precisely in this field the #european dockyards means have developed a very rich inventiveness, but investigation and development, and no only production and the acquisition, require money, and here is #where take part subventions.
From 1997, *Corean-*Gaz restricts biddings for fuselage construction *metaneros to the #korean dockyards, it that constitutes equally, in my opinion, rape of the international rules of liberalisation of the public agreements.
The European Union, gentleman Commissioner, with #all the political means, economic, financial and commercial to scope, has to take cost the international norms and put brake, once and for all, to the *dumping #korean, because the #european sector #can be viable in a loyal competitive surroundings.
States Joined, that present with propaganda image like champions of the *librecambismo, of the free market, only have this position for it that *les interests: for the audiovisual sector, for the sector *agroalimentario, for #everything it that *les interests.
Is a tragedy ascertain that still in the European Union there are defenceless citizens in front of the sectarian violence of #one #few, having to pay a very high price for keeping in convictions in front of the terrorist blackmail.
*Ojalá that enjoy during years and decades of a democratic politics in *Irlanda of the North and *le pray, lady Speaker and also through colleague here present #Jim *Nicholson, to the one who include in leadership of *Irlanda of the North, that transmit the best wishes of Parliament to #all *ellos.
Today occupy knowingly seat of #John *Hume, because like winner of Prize *Nobel of Parliament and because it has devoted #all life to guarantee the peace process, believe that it is important that *le honour since it finds *convaleciente in house of *Irlanda of the North.
Want to, in the first place, congratulate to rulers, to the political parties, to intermediaries and especially to village #british and to village of *Irlanda by peace path that have found, yielding #all in postures *originarias.
is not possible to allow to the representative of a big Group talk during three minutes and not conceding the use of the word to representative of a small Group, although we do not agree with *él and although it hurt it that goes to say.
Lady Speaker, as *usted will comprise, in these two planes, the world-wide and European, from the next year go to take of the anti-doping fight spear tip of politics sportive.
Second, exist the questions that of *ello derive as, for example, the fact that enlargement *repercutirá in the Institutions and in #all the #european organs like the Court of Justice and, definitely, also in Plenary that, to measure that go *ingresando new members, will have to prepare to receive until 700 and no more of 700 representatives.
The majority of the Group says: #if *Turquía happens to be member of the European Union, the Union -and is *algo that we have to have clear- will experience a qualitative change from the point of political sight, economic and cultural.
#One *CIG that do not amend mood to review the Treaties in the future and allow that the political sectors the weaken #would loom with paralysing the Union *cuando #this try *modernizarse after adhesion of the new States members.
And a Union that fears to reinforce his liberal character and member of parliament will be a little attractive Union for States members that incorporate and a little reliable speaker in the world-wide panorama.
To trial, it #would be necessary to consider models of distinct grade of adhesion and it #would be necessary to aspire to a concentric Union, in the that it had a core of Federal State and an external circle less integrated.
Remains for taking note that in the summit of *Helsinki will define with more precision politics of the European Union in his #nordic dimension and, thanks to *ello, will be able to reinforce the instruments for stability and security of *Europa of the North.
defence of democracy and the fight against the extremist movements split of the base of the social justice, it that means, among things, that it is necessary to finish with unemployment.
Today are to a historical minimum inside the brief history of the euro, and believe that the European Council of *Helsinki #would have to consecrate *algún space to the subject of the external representation of the zone euro.
am not at all of agreement: treats of a Summit of extraordinary importance that have prepared -Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency in exercise of the Council- with great care, with strength, and the challenge of enlargement is a historical challenge, #whose importance is crucial.
Split *ciñéndonos to the document presenting previously, with strong proposals and also with spirit that, after enlargement, will pose for real the problem to define with care, with attention and with a very wide debate the that they are the limits and nature of *Europa.
Exist agreements that #can conduct to closing strategy of head offices that offer security and that to time leave to these countries the possibility to surpass problems of realistic way and shared.
For example, #can take in have more detail in the future the questions related with the political asylum and with refugees, since *ello encloses a transcendental factor from sight point of the human rights.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam and disposals on the human rights that finish to go in in vigour improve performance possibilities of the EU to promote the human rights.
But the publication of this document *me incites to put the watches in the next future, the editorial of a Letter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
needs more concretion and development and some deeper analyses. Parliament will go back on this subject with a report that will vote in March of the next year and that will have the honour to be speaker.
The Council has to have the political value to loan more attention to the internal situation of the human rights in the EU in the next annual report.
Likewise, are expression of the #christian values that during two one thousand years have constituted an indispensable part of the *acervo cultural and spiritual European and that, in front of the new #millenium, are a glorious base to continue the fight in favour of the human rights.
In relation with the important process of enlargement eastwards, the requirements on suspension and back abolition of death pity have influenced, so much in the ethical concepts as in legislations, to improve life, even in our own continent.
To #that *respecto, the forum #whose creation asked Parliament #would have to exert an important paper; will be able to support in the already existent structures, in particular in the Economic and Social Committee of the European Community.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, once again, #few weeks after the debate on the extension of program #Socrates to youth #turkish, Parliament goes back to occupy of the controversial question of relations among the European Union and *Turquía.
Gentleman President, *Señorías, *yo want to manifest, in name of the Group of the Popular Party European (*Demócratacristianos)\/European Democrats, that the present proposal of directive constitutes a new contribution to the construction of the #european politics in favour of the quality of the air.
development of the managerial frame on the quality of the air acclimatise foresees the adoption of derivative directives for a series of harmful substances.
The requirements established by the European Commission and the amendments of the Environment Commission, Public Health and Politics of Consumer that the expand are very demanding from sight point.
A *tercer goal of the Directive Mark on the Quality of the Air, #as well as of the present proposal is to guarantee that States members evaluate the quality of the air of way coherent and comparable.
Therefore we propose the following new editorial: "In the reports of the years in that they will have to fulfil the partial goals and finals will mention #if decreases obey to technological measures adopted by manufacturers or #if they exist factors, #such like changes in behaviour of consumers."
Said #this, there are things that yes #can take to #european level, among the that includes change of culture, culture of place of work and culture of life mood.
#Such as the speaker signalled in intervention and in the report, the amendments to the Annexes 3 and 4 of the agreement on the half marine in the sea *Báltico already have been approved and will go in in vigour inside month.
Therefore, States members have to can define without bureaucratic fetters the selection criteria of reproduction material, as at all it #would be so *nefasto like some consequences *ulteriores that prejudiced to the group of the forest reservations.
The external quality of plant has a strong impact, no only in the percentage of plants that survive, that #can happen of the 85% to the 20%, but also in the future development in the extremely hard conditions of transplantation in this climate.
The possibility to effect the change of brusque form *nos continues resulting attractive, but no #all States members are convinced. Of here that we take a call so that the periods of parallel circulation are, in any case, minima.
The introduction of the euro has to result simple for citizens and consumers, minimising the problems that affect to particular communities and taking all it possible so that the introduction of the euro produce without problems in regions more moved away.
The present proposal for a Regulation of the Council contains changes regarding the area and to the calendar of restrictions designed to protect the spawn of herrings of the Bank #Douglas in the Sea of *Irlanda.
treats and treated of procurement of the #european market with fish and of production allocated to export with the end to conserve the direct and indirect places of work in the sea and in earth.
Regarding information to consumers, am fully in accordance with the Commission *cuando proposes the obligation of labeling that indicate denomination of species, capture and capture zone.
In this frame, the regulation of offer and demand of products *pesqueros has to answer to a double consideration: attend the needs of consumers and preserve development of the sector *pesquero own.
regulation has adapted to *ellas, and it is necessary to consider this report like a supplementary stage in the construction of organisation balanced among production and the management of resources *pesqueros.
Thus I want to recommend postponement of the processing of point until the #turkish Parliament have shown will to respect the fundamental human rights in *Turquía.
This Assembly has pronounced in favour of more right humans, in *pro of respect to the rights of minorities, in favour of the improvement in relations among *Turquía and #Grecia, in *pro of a solution of the #cypriot question.
In *primer term, although it have effected a big campaign of promotion of the euro, especially in moment of launching, although now it was *jurídicamente in vigour and know even #some setbacks *candentes in the international markets, citizens seem to have forgotten entirely existence.
Wanted to give the thanks to colleagues #italian that have put this wonderful *belén in front of the entrance of Plenary Hall and want to ask to #all the colleagues that contemplate piece of #european culture.
Thanks to the #arab world, thanks to the #arab culture, *Europa nowadays has all it that it is the #greek inheritance; thanks to the #arab world, has all it that it is recognition of the #greek culture.
Want that Parliament take a call to the Commission so that it study this subject for the first time from the perspective of the European Union and reestablish the civil right plenaries and politicians of families.

As I already have said, the question of the participation of the European Parliament in the Conference of River goes to treat in base to the principles agreed by the Council.

Are delivered very correctly among the distinct States and, as it also says with reason the speaker, no exist States ancient Members that still do not have agency and are convinced that for States new Members already will find other new agencies.
The most important points are: first, in the Commission have to delimit clearly the fields of work of Commissioners and acting, of analogous mood to Ministers and secretaries of State in the national Governments.
Believe that it is well remember saying to #all #that that think that the democratic deficit, control fault, negligence in the management and, in last place, but no therefore less important, the already notorious «*profitariado» to #european level #can reduce *traspasando even more competitions and more instruments and possibilities to level.
Like this, has some weeks, the Government presented a national program for the adoption of the *acervo community and a series of laws very important in matter of VAT and of special taxes, #as well as on the right to purchase sakes real estates.
It that do not helps to solve at all are demonstrations of #some States Members, included my own country, *Holanda, in the that pretty much follows refusing adhesion of *Chipre while it have not put end to partition of the island.
Is obvious that all #this do not depends only of legislation that adopt, but that it is important likewise make efforts in favour of the local organisations, so much #that of voluntary character as, for example, *Urban Forum, that already exerts activities in the Union, to end to allow expansion and operation in the *Europa Central and Oriental.
*Confrontados with the need to determine positions in negotiations, the countries candidates have introduced in a relatively short term considerable improvements in organisation and internal coordination.
In countries, and said was of step that no only occurs in the countries candidates, but also in States Members, produce long delays in the judicial procedures, frequently caused by staff fault of the judicial power.
Therefore, my first question to the Commission is the following: How reasons *convincentes have motivated to the Commission to substitute a system that works well, that do not prejudices to competition in the market and that results satisfactory for #everyone of the sector?
acceptance of the amendments #would comport a modification of the object of the current legislative procedure and #would involve taking of a decision without previous query of #all parts involved.
Regarding the question formulated also by Mrs. *Lulling, of #which are reasons *convincentes to modify norms for the sector *cervecero, the answer is that the current exemption by category exempts the closing of the market.
*Cuando the corresponding annual report to 1997 examined in Parliament, #some critical voices suggested that Defender of the European Village only had succeeded in a small number of cases.
#All members of our commission underline unanimously the need that it follow existing a Commission of independent Requests so that the direct contact with citizens keep in the future.
And the fact that #one of these fields in that they receive requests was environment shows *ejemplarmente how citizens and the no governmental organisations, of the one who split complaints, have an extraordinary worry by the preservation of the half natural.
In front of this situation, invite to each #one of members of this House to that they read with *detenimiento the annexes of the report of Mr. *Newman. Like this *percatarán that really it is absurd deliver competitions of this commission among the other commissions.
Also has given off today #this of the report that has presented Defender of Village to Parliament. *Le appreciate that it have defended so firmly the need of a transparent administration.
Request Commission and Defender of Village no will suffice, in the future -further of merits-, for *paliar incoherences and excesses of machinery *tecnocrática.
The decision adopted by the #german court *nos has cheered *muchísimo, but too much often type of causes judge in front of judges that, or ignore legislation relative to boy kidnapping, or are badly informed about *ella.
Besides, has presented amendment in the that urges to the Commission to that it elaborate criteria allocated to control efficiency of States members in the administration of the collection of the rights of customs.
This amendment also has to be contemplated in relation with the amendment 18, of the that the Commission estimates that it #can accept the *primer separated inserting it, without embargo, in the text of article 3 of the initial proposal of «Customs 2000», #where finds reason to be.
Until moment there #be had #one very fine communication and, therefore, think that program will go out forward without a conciliation procedure, since I think that #some of objections are so secondary that believe that my colleagues of Parliament will not put objections.
Lady Speaker, estimated colleagues, in September of the year happened the Commission *nos presented the White Book titled «just Rates by infrastructure use: gradual Strategy for a common frame of *tarificación of infrastructures of transport in the EU».
*Yo think, nevertheless, that the only effective form to carry to practice the principle that user pays consists in involving to #all users of transport infrastructure, without exception.
Parliament has right to manifest dissatisfaction by #some of actions of NATO, in particular the bombardment of civil goals and the utilisation of arms that #many consider like arms of destruction in mass.
deputies to the European Parliament of the *PASOK, vote against of the resolution of the European Parliament on *Kosovo because we consider that it do not offers positive services directed to find a solution of the problem.
In effect, do not forget never that diplomacy consists in taking accept, to *través of dialogue, to #one or part in conflict, a partial cession of his initial claims, of requirements or even of rights.
Wish, of course, a diplomatic exit European with support of States Joined and of *Rusia, but exit that do not suppose renunciation of the democratic principles and of the human rights.
But limit only to this analysis, means to forget that the military commitment of NATO against *Yugoslavia is the result of an unanimous #european will, that manifested in the Summit of *Berlín and of the that the federalistic congratulated and *congratularon, *considerándola like the true game of birth of the *PESC.
Also it is necessary to imagine a new conception of *Europa, valid for #all our continent: the of nation family allocated to coexist in confidence, identity *recobrada and recognised and the reciprocal respect.
With the proposal that supports a majority of Transport Commission and Tourism runs the risk to increase even more the derivative costs of the sector of transports.
In the Group of the *PPE have elaborated a series of amendments to counter these effects. Until moment have not reached support for these amendments.
Wanted to contribute firmly to improve the requirements according to the *cuales makes route that corresponds to road of distance of transport combined. And no, in last term, by means of decrease of the costs many times *desproporcionalmente elevated of parts limited of distance by road of transport combined.
The present communication of the Commission titles: «Establishment of performance frame». treats of a very useful document to examine #all the questions that pose regarding the financial services.
Gentleman President, #one of the very sensitive questions of the sector saves relation with supervision and the prudential control. This activity bases at present in borders and the national market.
With *respecto, in *primer term, to the need for a Commission, even *dimisionaria, of not interrupting the task undertaken, believe that the fact to continue it that already has begun form splits of the management of the common subjects.
Wanted to highlight that, regarding the possibility of a better supervision of the financial services in the field of the European Union, attention #would have to centre in the financial groups complexes.
The report that have elaborated and the amendments that present are the reflection of the debate in #whose virtue Plenary approved, the past month of March, a resolution on violence against women.

Gentleman President, 48 political parties prepare for the elections. manifest political currents among the parties characterised by the *islamismo, nationalism, liberalism, support to the central planning and the maintenance of the *statu *quo .
Has to insist to the #indonesian Government so that it leave to support to the organisations *paramilitares, limit the military presence, reestablish right state and truly arrest to the guilty and the carry in front of the courts.
Alas, have to take again a call to Government #burmese so that the fundamental rights of village respect with general character. Again, have to condemn firmly trip *forzoso of villages and the utilisation of persons like compulsory workers.
To time, believe that, with regard to *Birmania, in addition to the necessary initiatives of isolation, is precise to fix a political strategy to favour change in country, change that, as we have seen, also village #burmese wishes firmly.
Is #ours to have to urge to the Commission to that it exert pressure on the neighbouring countries so that *Birmania finish isolating , the Government find in the obligation to resign and leave of abuse to the inhabitants of villages that are forced to make works forced or that they are deported in block.
To time have to encourage and *emplazar to the Council to that it interrupt #all activities in the that was jointly with the countries of the *ASEAN and *Birmania, aside to *Birmania of said actions and procure that the Presidency #german leave to award visas of entrance, to the equal that the countries community.
Still remains *algo of hope put that the opposition has manifested wish of *darle an opportunity to the Army so that *restituya power to a civil Government in term of nine months.
The Commission examines by moment, #such as it has suggested from this House, how disposals #can adopt in view of the recent events and #one of the possibilities is that it propose to the Council paralyse partially cooperation to development according to the known by #all *ustedes article 366 *bis of the Agreement of *Lomé.
Is precise to ascertain, once again, that the ambitious goal of Parliament has seen hindered by the opposition of States members that *obstinan in refusing the logical consequences of the application of the only market.
agriculturalists do not understand import, pertinent of third countries, of agricultural products modified genetically allocated to the animal feeding, since they exist suspicions regarding the effects on a long-term basis, with regard to the quality of meat, of utilisation of *OMG.
institutions are *sólidamente established and guarantee the existence of right State, respect of the human rights, #as well as respect and the protection of minorities.
Taking into account subsidiariness principle, consider clear and *decididamente that the EU has to establish only some minimum rates and that corresponds to the respective States members manage said rates, #among others reasons because the European Union do not has to have on no account of rights in the fiscal field.
pleads aptly in this report by that they also support projects directed to find to the victims, eventual victims of kidnappings that, for example, disappear in prostitution and that maybe go back to appear in photos, that with commercial ends are offered in network by determined criminal.
In consequence, has included in the title «public Health» a field to the that, to our understand, #would have to apply by greater coherence article 308 of said Treaty. Is to say, the that, in definite, attributes powers of action no on purpose planned, *cuando action of the Community result necessary to reach #one of the goals of the Community.
Without embargo, probability that authors are carried in front of the courts is considerably lower that in the case of drug traffic or of arms. *Ello has to mainly to the fault of valid proofs.
His gradual enlargement to the countries that *ingresen in the EU, as they have mentioned varied deputies, and to the countries of the *AELC, *reviste vital importance, in view of the transnational dimension of #many of forms of violence.
Have of a report of the juridical adviser of Parliament that *nos orients among things about the subject of the common subjects. Said *dictamen collects fundamental disposals with regard to the question that are now.
In this sense, although the simple assimilation to censorship motion do not seems indicated, seems according to the spirit of the Treaty look for solutions that are compatible with the principle of parliamentary confidence.
So that, #if have 75 millions of persons that surpass the 60 years and a 42 % of the voters have more of 50 years age, is evident that the questions of citizens of the third age and of age persons advanced go to be important in the campaign.
Expect that the present Commission action program on health of age persons advanced and for #all the Community of compliance with article 137.
(OF ) Gentleman President, history of this conference, «age persons in the century *XXI: new perspectives of life», puts of self-evident difference that there #be among the said and the fact *cuando treats of age persons advanced.
has to adapt work to the capacities and the needs of persons, in place to demand to workers adaptation to the requirements of the labour activity.
#If it do not reaches to form to the most greater workers to exert new tasks, persons will find exposed to discrimination situation in work places, to time that numerous sectors suffer shortage of hand of drama.
Besides, the report do not detains in the enormous potential of knowledges that possesses person of 65 years and the current tendency of the labour market to follow having citizens of the third age.
Is satisfaction reason that in the report take upsetting in the enormous potential that offer the greater persons and in the need to act to end to explode this potential.
In #one of the examples takes reference to the need to guarantee to the elderly a sufficient level of income. often, the situation of the most greater women is considerably more *desfavorable that the of men.
#would not be a fine idea that in zones ecologically sensitive, like lakes *fineses, imposed in measure of it possible the use of products elaborated from agricultural products, for example plastic matters to base of starch, *biolubricante in #all lakes *fineses, elaborated from products with #alto contained in proteins in the south of *Europa.
#If, #such as, as it seems, is forced to observe nowadays, take #some #granting to the Americans, especially in the subject of wheat #gluten, in the that they are these last the that *nos assault without that we have presented still complaint in front of the World-wide Organisation of Trade, certainly #can house legitimate worries.
Have developed the biological oils, that #can be introduced in aqueous zones protected, in Lake #Constanza or #where was, #as well as also in the field of leisure #where damage is each more greater #if they do not use oils.
The of technological type, #this is, measures for the that there #be technology available, are the that fundamentally have attracted attention of Investigation Commission, Technological Development and Energy of the European Parliament.
The phenomenon of the *acqua high that, *cuando self-evident, covers around half metre the historical centre, produces some ten times to the year and creates increasing annoyances to citizens and, even more, to the economic activities of #Venecia Lagoon, the insular part of city.
The Group of Independent by the *Europa of Nations requests that it withdraw of the agenda the report of Mrs. #Miranda of *Lage on collaboration agreement among the European Community and States Joined Mexicans.
fulfilled the requirements that, in this case, *nos take *remitirnos of Record of 1976, to the regulation on privileges and immunities in the primary Right, and of here to the #portuguese Constitution and even to the #portuguese procedural Right.
#can not be that in the past -and expect that only in the happened- the great Groups of this Assembly had a greater interest in protecting to the Commission that in *llamarla to responsibility and in strengthening to the own Parliament?
Of luck, approval procedure of the management has voted by simple majority, but denial of the approval of the management has voted by absolute majority.
Lady Speaker, as it finishes to say president *Fayot, in this report there #be had an excellent collaboration among Regulation Commission and the Commission of Budgetary Control.
Lady Speaker, *originariamente the present report of Employment Commission owed *versar, especially, about a communication of the Commission on article 127 of the Treaty of *Amsterdam and, in concrete, in relation with the *mainstreaming of employment politics to community level.
Has to contain concrete measures and engage to #all the involved to fulfil clear agreements, so much to the Central Bank European, to the social speakers, as to the Council of the *ECOFIN and to the Council of Social Subjects.
Has been the Council in particular, that in #some questions very important, for example trip of taxes on employment to environmental and energetic taxes, do not wants to advance and probably now have remained again blocked.
Lady Speaker, the report of the Commission on the great orientations, that this year characterises by a qualitative improvement, loans to employment a special attention, and stresses the need of authentic structural changes.
Is as #if the governments and the social speakers by himself\/hisself alone #can influence the economic politics and as #if #ECB did not have also paper in relation with support of the economic politics.
Gentleman President, in name of my colleague Mr. *Flynn, wanted to begin congratulating to Mr. *Menrad by report and appreciating to Employment Commission and Social Subjects his fast work on the resolution project.
In *Viena the European Council asked a greater synergy among the two processes and the Commission answered to request with his great guidelines of economic politics more recent and communication on article 127.
But *yo create to be able of *tranquilizarle. The strategy of fiscal coordination proposal by the Commission and adopted by unanimity by the Council «*Ecofin», defended #among others by the speaker, Mr. *Fourçans, is not obviously a strategy of attractive harmonisation.
Second, the director is forced on purpose to contact and inform to the national judicial authorities competent, #if in the internal investigations collaborators find states of things that #can be notable from the point of penal sight.
Of luck the Commission renounced, fortunately, to the *estrafalaria contrives to entrust competition in matter of irregularities and of frauds to an external agency with, *pásmense, 48 employees, is to say, with civil servant to protect an average of 2.000 millions of euros.
By reason the creation of this new organ of fight against fraud means a big opportunity for the Community and an important goal of our Presidency of the Council.
Gentleman President, the report of Mr. *Bösch and the decision of the Commission to create a #european office of prevention of fraud indicates the end of a long process that initiated in 1995.
The paramount goals were the to underline the obligations of personnel to cooperate in investigations and to time protect the rights of individual.
November amendments of 1998 to the budgetary regulation made possible modernisation of the financial control, especially regarding assignment of resources no used.
On the procedure, wanted to express my gratitude to the colleagues of the Commission of Budgetary Control that have taken contributions to approval process of the management.
Also corresponds to the political character of this report the coalition of approval procedure of the management in a wider perspective.
do not have to consider requests to the Court of Accounts so that it take part in studies like cancellation of responsibility of the Commission and of Parliament concerning measures that adopt.
But the Court of Accounts has exerted a very important paper and very useful in this process among Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
In speaker condition, have received paper in the that in fact it reflects the loss of thousands of millions in erroneous investments and that money finds unseen in accounts or has been concealed.
Results quite funny, because, #if His *Señorías retreat a year or two, will see that the Court of Accounts criticised to civil servants of *Dublín that used the weekends like part of mission: obviously, *les enjoys to take trip to country to time.
Gentleman President, expect with interest day -and do not believe that it was too much far- in that the Court of Accounts #can give to these two agencies guarantee certificate by «not dipping in *líos», for saying it like this, and for obtaining fine reports of the Court.
Gentleman President, gentleman President of the Council, gentleman Commissioner, Development Commission and Cooperation has to approve year to year the management of the European Bottom of Development but do not has *influjo #any on way in that it uses Bottom, because up to now it has not been *presupuestado.
#If *algo positive has resulted of the corresponding report to 1996, has been access that the Commission of Budgetary Control has had to persons and the documents.
postponement constitutes as, the justest solution technically, solution that has a political value of gesture of *apaciguamiento to the new Commission without excluding in any case the most strict surveillance and #one firmness.
As I consider natural that transfer to the next term of office, *permítaseme, meanwhile, that take part, like speaker for the granting of the approval of the management to the Economic and Social Committee relative to the exercise of 1996, to affirm that no *le will be able to concede without that before it pronounce the *UCLAF on irregularities in *ella detected.
defence of the liberal, of #that that always have recognised in the *rule *of *law axis of his political action, always has based in the principle that they #can not put objections to the texts.
Gentleman President, wanted to answer to the questions formulated by Mr. *Elles on the preparation of the different documents based in program that Mr. *Santer presented in January and to the that it has taken reference in #many of the reports on the approval of the management.
have initiated the technical negotiations in search of consensus with the organisations of personnel and also have celebrated the first political sessions in search of consensus.
Of compliance with the agenda, proceeds to the debate of the Statement of the Commission on the procedure *OMC for arrangement of conflict among the European Union and States Joined of *América.
Gentleman President, gentleman Vice-president of the Commission, in this commercial war -bananas, hormones- there #be appendix that, as #all know, affects to companies and economic sectors Europeans that do not have at all that see with the sectors object of conflict.
This morning in *Bruselas, before coming here, have celebrated a meeting with representatives of the textile industry #european and understand perfectly the gravity of the situation for *ella and for persons that find in the situation of victims.
Precisely because it treats of experiment, the majority of the Commission of Economic Subjects agreed with the general criteria and no with delimitation of the field of application to determined sectors.
Parliament has proposed that the Commission, in *concertación with the European Parliament and, for example, on the base of the *dictámenes of high personalities and in *concertación with the national parliaments, give a new opportunity to this institutional dynamics.
Equality of opportunities for men and women, for whites and blacks, for #all colours, on the base of the human dignity of individual. #This is the characteristic more remarkable of the European Union, his immense human face.
Without embargo, no it will be necessary to tackle only the big structural reform of the Commission, for the *cual also Parliament has presented already concrete proposals. Is precise to recognise that the European Parliament will have to reorganise in like manner to be able to fulfil properly tasks.
Suffice to think in dispute among States Joined and *Europa by skin trade of animals captured of form cruel, banana trade and of meat with hormones and in concrete by organisms manipulated genetically, especially after the failure, because of the *intransigencia American, of the Summit on *Bioseguridad of *Cartagena of Indians.
Is true that in the last years, like consequence of the fall of the wall of *Berlín, of enlargement to new countries of the *Europa Central and of the North, in the perspective of enlargement to the countries of the *Europa Central and Oriental, *Europa has displaced to the north and eastwards.
The vote in favour of Mr. *Prodi and the vote in favour of the new School, in my opinion, will consecrate a confidence pact among Parliament and the Commission that has to last five years.
The *segunda thing that *me #would enjoy to mention today is work to hour to reform work and work methods of the Commission -the new business culture.
It true is that *Europa has not been able to advance with speed owed by these great paths of the new growth that include especially the new sectors: #software , telecommunications and also, as it has remembered in regard to my previous speech, the that have called «sciences of life».
do not lose hope that in the course of the next term of office *nos loan more attention, because my fight in defence of honey producers and in defence of products of high quality, in *Europa and in the Community, will continue here or out of Parliament.
The fundamental lines of the economic politics are extraordinarily wander and imprecise in occasion and, therefore, come to say that for the moment it will follow acting simply as it has taken up to now, which results extremely problematic to sight of the problems accumulated.
Think, therefore, that it is necessary to put end what before to the military climbing, to simplifications of propaganda, and consecrate #all energy to go back on terrain of research of a political solution.
To reach said pact of stability in the *Balcanes, #whose positive perspectives *nos has exposed, gentleman President of the Council, Europeans have to have value, #if really *les concerns and have felt of the independence, to interrupt the logic of climbing bellicose.
The human drama has transformed in disaster, the victims of the *hipócritas collateral accidents multiply, the pretext of *Rambouillet has disappeared, autonomy of *Kosovo and the ethnic rights have not reestablished.
Is *algo that #one no *le wishes to nobody, and much less to village #serbian and to boys #serbian that have been conducted to the disaster by madness of leader, of mood that has deported of hundreds of thousands of persons.
temporary Protection of a substantial number of refugees in States members and #all the possible support in material sense to the countries of the region, also *cuando have happened the crisis: *eso is it that *nosotros advocate.
Of compliance with Regulation, will invite to candidate selected to that it take part in front of the Commission of External Subjects, Security and Political of Defence on 21 June so that we #can formulate a positive recommendation to July Plenary.
*Yo declare also that while no have changes *interinstitucionales regarding intervention of the right of democratic control of the European Parliament, the possibilities of influence in matter of external politics will be inferior to the that had up to now.
Parliament takes a proposal that needs permission of the Council, the fixed Council conditions for permission, and Parliament has the possibility of *considerarlas and *discutirlas again.
Wanted to that it heard voice and, instead, *nos find confronted to a Council that of course, in forty-eight hours, *nos presents version, form in that *él, the Council, wants to treat to deputies and, therefore, also diets, mission costs, #etcetera.
#If the intention had been that applied the procedure of *codecisión, #such as it establishes in article 189 *b, editors of the Treaty of *Amsterdam #would have inscribed in the text: will apply the procedure of article 189 *b.
Finally, want *agradecerle in spite of #all to Mr. *Rothley that referred to my proposal to allow to the countries with tax on the high income add an additional tax to the community tax.
As it collects in the proposal of the Council, deputies to the European Parliament have to be had also to subject to control on the appropriate utilisation of bottoms in matter of administrative costs.
Expect that it get *próximamente to an acceptable solution for Parliament and the Council, #if well we comprise that Parliament has to decide #if the current position of the Council is acceptable total or partially, and entrust in that it early #can get to an agreement.
In relation with the total figure of subjects that has to tackle institution community, the number of personnel of Defender of Village is considerably inferior to the of the #others equivalent institutions in States members.
Is necessary to recognise that, until moment, Parliament has shown a relatively favourable attitude to the proposals of Mr. *Söderman to resolve the problems more *acuciantes of the Union in matter of personnel.
Want to base it of the following way: in the last week, in Transport Commission have debated on these questions, but the situation has changed with the entrance in vigour of the Treaty of *Amsterdam.
Also #would be urgently necessary an agreement among the two directives relative to commercialisation to distance with the directive on the electronic commercial transactions, *cuando know his definite form.
#If we want a real inner market in the field of the financial services, it is necessary to guarantee to consumer and to provider that will enjoy of rights inside #all the Union.
Therefore, lean service *le go to take to consumer #if, through a sectorial directive, begin to *desequilibrar the very complex building of relations -has mentioned subsidiariness principle- among community Right and Right of States members.
Without embargo, our proposal *nos seems charitable so much for companies as for consumers because parts will know #which are regulations that have to apply and parts #can entrust in that they apply commercialisation regulations, without matter the origin of services.
A defective product is defined like product that do not corresponds with it established *contractualmente and also include in this concept the public statements that manufacturer or dealer make in advertising or that find in label.
To guarantee that it do not deceive to consumer, the guarantees have to contain clear and transparent informations, among #others the statement that the guarantee do not affects to the legal rights of consumer.
The directive ensures that States members take transposition of the international right for January of 2002, creating with *ello a minimum group of regulations that concede to consumer right to appeal resource.
#If we see the calendar, *me cheers especially that am of the last looks of this directive in the last partial period of sessions of Parliament -that also for me is the last session, at least in it that *atañe to the subjects of consumers.
Therefore, is indispensable to have a greater sensitivity in front of the problems that these regions have.*d)highlights the importance of training of the population so that it contribute to his own *autoprotección. include also the situations of environmental emergency.
The goal of this proposal, as it is very known and has mentioned also, is to guarantee the continuation of the current program of action in matter of civil protection, founded in the resolution of the Council of 1998 that expires on 31 December 1999.
Results that the amendment 19 and varied parts of the amendment 23 go directed to increase the participation of the *ONG in the civil protection, *algo in it that agree of course and that, therefore, accept also in principle because it awards to the *ONG the possibility to take part in the exchange of experts.
The Environment Commission, Public Health and Protection of Consumer has taken to feel presence in the increasingly important field of the environmental legislation and know that we will follow taking it.
mates in Parliament wanted this directive, without embargo, believe that in this case have to listen to the organisations of *diabéticos, the *cuales have manifested unanimously that commercialisation and the easy access to products for *diabéticos create a false need among the *diabéticos.
Is to expect that commitment of the Council to collect now a *dictamen to the Scientific Committee of Foods have by result the abandonment of the idea to elaborate a directive to the *respecto.
Expect that the following step was that the EU improve also the possibilities of the ecological agriculturalists to produce the necessary products of competitive form, *algo that do not takes lamentably Diary 2000.
Thus it has to serve so that the European Parliament see how in the directives of technical character there #be a political content that #can not leave in hands of an expert committee.
Expect that Parliament approve Thursday the Report *Aglietta relative to conditions for the exert of the executive competitions attributed to the Commission so that hit history in the case of the *potitos see confirmed by #a lot of #others more.
So in point have abandoned our position that keep always and that will follow keeping to base our legislative measures in scientific knowledges, with the exception that they exist really causes of weight that *nos say that we have to follow only to the principle of prevention without scientific knowledges.
The Treaty of *Amsterdam also modifies procedure properly said, and *eso knows less, providing an absolute equality among Parliament and the Council in the course of the procedure.
In fact was not a committed simple by reasons, but, especially, also because the Council no always comprised in sufficient grade transcendence and complexity of this reform and -create- neither had sufficient consciousness, and more specifically in recent period, that we #can not allow that *infringieran determined principles of a free Parliament.
From my Group ask the evaluation of politics and, with #all criticisms that have been able to take from the Group, the work that *ustedes have taken in this term of office, going out of distinct political Groups, has been very *estimable.
The period of activity has had a big hit and #this is not the opinion only of my political group. Has made some great services to Parliament.
Believe that, of compliance with the Regulation that *usted always has kept and respected *escrupulosamente, *permitiéndonos like this work *respetandolo, in the collective balance had to *usted have included that Parliament finalises term of office and has not been able to avert war in #european territory.
A big support has obtained here the idea to include in the future dialogue on the fiscal politics, *salarial and monetary also to the social speakers and to the Central Bank European.
Already was employment, *Kosovo, enlargement or the operation of the institutions, the European Union has to learn to talk with an alone voice for the 15 States members but also for the institutions.
In brief, need that on the table of the Conference *Intergubernamental have a document it more authorised possible and #this because another type of preparation of the Conference *Intergubernamental #can guarantee a safer result in matter of reforms.
Lady Speaker, the Treaty of *Amsterdam that it #can define like the Treaty of the #stray occasions, has gone in in vigour only from takes #some days and already takes lacking to integrate it and complete it with chapters relative to the institutional questions no resolved in *Amsterdam.
An important element of this task constitute it the approval and the practical application of performances recommended in the northern dimension, that already has accepted.
The Council has declared besides had to negotiate in moment on the put to disposal of until 200 millions of euros of flexibility reservation of the budget like compensation for the innovative measures.
Parliament also has reached to impose criterion in the unification of #all the structural measures for fishing in Category 2 and in the horizontal programming unified.
Now well, accept a Statute of the #european deputies #would be like happening of a juridical nature of international right to a nature of right constitutional internal.
The reduction of paper of State, the blind belief in the rules of competition or of liberalisation to create employment are recipes that already have known.
In this *coyuntura critical that are *Europa and the whole world, the election of Mr. *Prodi (to the one who vote *gustoso) like President of the European Commission, by part of Parliament, gives beginning to a new period in the European Union.
Have *presionado in favour of a transparent system of payments of diets, of a same wage for deputies to the European Parliament of #all the countries and in favour of a suitable method of direct payments for personnel.
The new statute characterised by rigour and transparency regarding the rights and duties among #all the representatives chosen and allowed that it finished, once and for all, with the *indefiniciones and the *elucubraciones, that are resource preferred of #all those that, by road, procure to weaken value of the political action.
But each #one of colleagues that has pronounced in favour of the Report *Rothley will have to assume responsibilities in front of the public opinion and to shrinking of the only Statute of the #european Deputies.
Are firmly convinced that deputies to the European Parliament have been chosen by the population of the countries members to represent the interests of the constituents in the EU.
Consider that the fundamental points of this reform are remuneration only, #one *imposición national public prosecutor and repayment of trip costs with arrangement to the real costs.
It that regret a lot in commitment is the fact that States members to hour to apply the guidelines have the possibility to introduce claim of two months.
Only #can wish that States members do not take use of this possibility of claim in two months as like this consumers #would have the possibility to prolong the guarantee to two years.
On the other hand, #if the *OMC forced to the EU to liberalise totally banana trade, #can warm up the absolute certainty that sooner or later it #would finish with support diet to the community producers of banana.
The social question, #if well it appears with less sharpness in the commercial conflicts sees, unlucky and systematically prejudiced in the logic of the opening of the market #such as it prevails in these moments, is to say, without social and environmental norms.
Has got moment to base the necessary international exchanges and the opening of the markets with other principles, with another frame that the that dictate the *OMC, the *GATT or the new cooperation *trasatlántica.
From these two examples, only #can ascertain that the agreements of the *GATT that gave origin to the World-wide Organisation of Trade are hurtful for the interests of citizens of States members of the European Union.
Am fundamentally against of any type of #european army, of a police body European or of defence identity #european in breast of the EU.
In *tercer place, the need to have national programs, and no only regional, to guarantee coherence of the structural politics with ordination plans *plurianuales of the fleets.
Thus, want to take advantage of occasion and express to the Presidencies of the Council and, especially, to German, my congratulations for having reached create a viable base for the final sprint.
With the new goals of help 1, 2 and 3 and the community initiatives *INTERREG, *LEADER, *EQUAL and *URBAN have of some effective instruments with the that we #can make an important contribution to the strengthening of competitiveness of the regions and to the creation of places of work.
Nevertheless, in a wider context, is important to say today that in spite of #all doubts that exist about #some details of the agreement *interinstitucional and of the financial perspective, is better to have *algo that it is lightly unsuitable in opinion of #some, but that already has been approved, that follow looking for perfection and not achieving at all.
will comprise It #if it is possible that accompaniment measures, that costs for the rural areas impute to costs no compulsory, it that no means that no *nos feel forced to that they have to spend , but elevates the *margen general of configuration of Parliament for this increasing political.
Of way #can remain in the logic of our parliamentary vote and to time guarantee a greater security to graziers, with #such that the Council and the Commission have wisdom of *seguirnos.
Even *yo #would say that the European Commission -*impulsora of action of the European Union-in management of the proposals of reform has given the impression of not knowing very well to where directs.
Have listened the answer of Mr. President in exercise of the Council, have heard the synthesis of postures of the 15, is to say, that the European Union wait that *Turquía respect it that is in vigour in regard to grave subjects of this type.
Subject: humanitarian Help to persons needed in *Ucrania According to #worthy sources of credit, in application of the Law for defence of the local producers of *Ucrania the packages of small size in the that they send to country foods, clothes and even medicines mark like «agricultural products» to arrival and return to the *remitente.
Subject: Increase of mortality and *míseras conditions of life in the *Iraq by the *draconianas economic sanctions According to recent complaints of speaker of the Medical Association for Prevention of War, Mrs. *Sue *Wareham, among 4.500 and 6.000 boys die *mensualmente in the *Iraq by the *hambre and illnesses because of the tragic fault of foods and medicines.
The Council received the report of the Court of Accounts on the training of common companies in the sector *pesquero on 9 December 1998.
In this proposal of the Commission contain determined measures directed to delete irregularities mentioned in the report of the Court of Accounts on the management of the common companies.
In principle, want to say on interpretation of tongue #swedish that exists program of the Council for placing and training of interpreters in #swedish tongue that has been delivered also to the #swedish Government and that program finds already in stage of application.
Lady Speaker, State Secretary *Verheugen has comported like the diplomatic more *avezado. has not mentioned at all that, of course, President of the Council #can board negotiations with States members so that #this present relation *equitativa of women and men like candidates to the Commission.
This possibility the has President of the Commission confirmed today by his *Señorías. And this President of the Commission, that has been chosen also because *le supposes that it goes to be able to take use of effective mood of the rights that *le compete, pursues the goal that *usted has mentioned.
On the other hand -and #this is it worse, in opinion of my Group-, have not put means to correct the existent disequilibriums among the continental productions and the #mediterranean and among the small and the great exploitations.
To end, is necessary to intensify to #all levels cooperation with the regional and local authorities and the socioeconomic operators, nearer to the reality *cambiante of the region.
In effect, #Italia, my country, #can see prejudiced to a large extent to hour to establish the ceiling of the Goal 2, since to the maximum reduction guaranteed of the 33 % #would add the caused by the inclusion of the regions that will go out of the Goal 1.
Am studying at present the repercussions that will have the package of Diary 2000 for a region like #this that, in spite of suffering some climatological conditions *desfavorables in relation with the agricultural regions of *Europa central, depends of the agricultural activity.
Another sector thinks that for the countries that take part in the monetary union Cohesion Bottom has reached goal and has contributed to the nominal convergence.
Also to me *me #would enjoy *unirme to the gratitudes to the Commission, to commissioners here present and to #all the that have carried out a hard work during time that have occupied my seat in Parliament.
Therefore we are satisfied with this reform and consider that it has been glorious hit of Parliament that have had a so wide agreement in the organisation of the market of wine.
Gentleman President, in November defended the continuation of the community initiative *Urban, since also the small cities and average that situate out of the areas of application, the areas of the feeble and patients, have problems.
Gentleman President, ladies and gentlemen Commissioners, gentleman President of the Council, wanted to in brief go back on the report of colleague Mr. Baron *Crespo and declare that *nos are for enlargement that characterises by that in front of our door finds a series of countries, it that ten years ago was practically *inimaginable.
Nevertheless, the current formulas contrived by the negotiators #would result acceptable to effects of the Commission as long as no existed a double network of security that offered to the Council means to refuse an executive measure proposal.
Have to express my recognition to Mr. *Hughes, President of the Commission of Social Subjects and Employment, the one who has been promoter of this intense debate on security and work.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament are fundamental for the establishment of a solid and coherent strategy against the risks derived of the explosive atmospheres.
And is that, in the first place, negotiations have not finished; second, that there #be had lacking of transparency, fault of participation and fault of information; and in last place, that there #be not follow-up mechanism of the environmental clauses, social neither of the democratic clause.
Gentleman President, since I got to Parliament in 1994, this Assembly has had very clear that the future of the European Union plays here, in this border terrain of the *tercer *pilar, in terrain of the rights and freedoms.
To conclude *me #would enjoy to treat of two looks that the Presidency #german has recognised that go in in the field of the *primer *pilar: the protection of personal data and the question of visas.
The amendment 63 of Mr. *Glante introduces a very important element and at the same time very dangerous, since it goes back to put on the *tapete the subject of the exceptions to the definition of broadcast.
#would Be very regrettable that the European Parliament went to result less liberal that the Commission, having present that are of an area with a very advanced technology and in fast transformation in the that *Europa finds in grave danger of remaining increasingly backwards regarding States Joined.
Believe that no *nos corresponds to *nosotros like legislators *legitimizar practice that authorises to the *publicistas to invite *ellos same to use telephone bills of the other and to use infrastructure of Internet providers to pay marketing.
Gentleman President, in #few years goes to *rebasar barrier of the 500 millions of persons connected to network. As it finishes to expose very well Mr. *Hoppenstedt, has opened an entirely new market that seats the bases of a future source of growth in *Europa.
Gentleman President, the past Monday, Budget Commission decided on the approval or rejection of the Agreement *Interinstitucional in a meeting that was summoned in rule and had permission.
The repeated *incomprensiones with the Commission and the Council *nos have exposed to the risk to cancel the result of *tantos efforts, with the danger to reduce negotiations to pulses among the Institutions.
With the end to relieve charge of the four States *beneficiarios of Cohesion Bottom, took to pay for the second time to the States -among the that it finds *Francia- price of convergence criteria.
The group of the #french members of the Group *Europa of Nations have voted against of the legislative resolution, it that has allowed to validate, in point, commitment of *Berlín.
Gentleman President, like French and citizens of the countries of *Europa, are horrified by the intensification of the exodus of the Albanians of *Kosovo and by the parallel intensification of bombardments of NATO.
war in *Yugoslavia, call ()»Humanitarian War»(!!!) in a euphemism apotheosis *hipócrita, has caused great losses in the civil population and has sharpened the tragedy of refugees.
By misfortune, seems that violence goes in increase in #all the region and #news of a new massacre *perpetrada this week by army #indonesian confirm once again reputation of merciless violence.
The problem of *Timor has been tackled here many times during the term of office and maybe was of the subjects of international politics and of defence of the human rights more tackled in Parliament.
Is precise also reaffirm complaint and conviction of countries that of form *hipócrita follow acclaiming the human rights, but do not hesitate in following selling arms to diet guilty of genocide of village.
#If it do not guarantees a neutral military strength in *Timor, the true option of the referendum will not be among autonomy and the independence, but among integration or life.
This question, in principle, will have to be resolved by the Council of ministers, that will determine, in the frame of Nations Joined, respecting the terms of the agreement among Indonesian and *Portugal, modalities that go to follow for the participation.
